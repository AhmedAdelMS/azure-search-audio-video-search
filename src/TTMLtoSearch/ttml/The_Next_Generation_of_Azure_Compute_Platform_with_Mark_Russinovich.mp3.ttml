      <p begin="00:00:07.270" end="00:00:10.150">It's a little lame good morning everybody.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.150" end="00:00:14.380">That's a lot better...build conference gone so far</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.380" end="00:00:20.280">awesome isn't that what is the best session...seen all day.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.280" end="00:00:23.470">I want to welcome you all to build welcome you all to an exciting new</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.470" end="00:00:27.650">...development I want to welcome the online viewers that are watching this live-in those that are going to watch this</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.650" end="00:00:30.820">...recorded version of this that's why we had such...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.410" end="00:00:35.350">Orchestrated start to the session here.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.350" end="00:00:39.740">...talk about is adders next generation compute platform got a bunch of announcements to make</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.740" end="00:00:45.120">in the session and a bunch of really cool demos to show you in the session as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:49.790">This is the weather obstruction the session the kind of take you from the very top-level because we</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.790" end="00:00:54.700">can't talk about compute without talking about adders overall application model which we call the as</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.700" end="00:00:59.030">resource manager all talk about that for those of you that might</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.030" end="00:01:03.970">not be familiar with it...something that is already jade but what I'll do it from there is</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.970" end="00:01:08.510">take you into some of the new api that are plugged into</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.510" end="00:01:13.220">as a resource manager that we're announcing today and those are around virtual machines</p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.220" end="00:01:17.790">storage and networking resources completely changing the way that you interact with</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:21.130">these types of resources in...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.130" end="00:01:25.890">And, then I'll talk about service fabric which we announced we pre announced last week...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.890" end="00:01:31.140">the blog post what you're going to get here is an sdk to play with service fabric for those you</p>
      <p begin="00:01:31.140" end="00:01:34.980">didn't see the blog maybe don't know what service fabric is I'm going to give me give you</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.980" end="00:01:39.170">a pretty detailed overview of service fabric which are really excited about which is</p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.170" end="00:01:44.940">a micros service-based orchestration platform let's go and get started talk about as</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.940" end="00:01:47.900">...manager just out of curiosity how many people have used as</p>
      <p begin="00:01:47.900" end="00:01:52.330">your resource manager so just a few of you those of you</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.330" end="00:01:57.180">...been using...for sometime a problem using cloud services and the existing portal</p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.180" end="00:02:00.480">will resource manager is a different way of looking at</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.480" end="00:02:01.270">...applications</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.400" end="00:02:07.300">let-me set some context here because if you take a look at the original cloud service application model,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.300" end="00:02:11.390">you know, that was just focused on compute and network and it left a lot of the glue</p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.390" end="00:02:16.290">of connecting other types of...services including even just storage to those</p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.290" end="00:02:20.420">gm's that you're putting in their cloud services up to you if you</p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.420" end="00:02:24.290">...website you deployed a website and then you deployed a database and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:24.290" end="00:02:28.000">it was up to you to glue those together with as a resource manager</p>
      <p begin="00:02:28.000" end="00:02:32.000">we define this concept of resource grouping where you can group collections</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.000" end="00:02:38.520">...resources together that make-up the whole application or part of a larger application.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.520" end="00:02:43.260">Each resource instance that you put into a research group is a of a resource type and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.260" end="00:02:43.550">I've already</p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.550" end="00:02:48.440">mentioned some of the resource types like virtual machines like databases like storage accounts.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.440" end="00:02:53.030">And, those resource types are defined by what we call research providers the as a resource managers</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.030" end="00:02:57.710">completely extensible so it comes with a number of built-in resource providers that provide that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.710" end="00:03:03.130">define their own resource types but when we want to add a new research provider to the as</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.130" end="00:03:07.840">your platform ourselves there's no need to go change as a resource manager other than</p>
      <p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:12.560">register the resource provider in the types that it's going to support where.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.560" end="00:03:16.340">We've already on boarded some third-party research providers as well</p>
      <p begin="00:03:16.340" end="00:03:20.700">and you'll cs light up the on boarding process so that others more and more</p>
      <p begin="00:03:20.700" end="00:03:25.990">you can onboard your own resource providers into this model now one of the concepts here</p>
      <p begin="00:03:25.990" end="00:03:31.760">that we're sticking to is that resource groups art</p>
      <p begin="00:03:31.760" end="00:03:36.060">concepts deeply baked in the platform there's no such thing as a resource now</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.060" end="00:03:40.590">...asher that is not part of a resource group so when you...just create a...account</p>
      <p begin="00:03:40.590" end="00:03:50.370">if that's the only thing you're interested in you're still putting in a container which is a resource group.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:50.370" end="00:03:54.840">What you get by putting these things in these containers is that you get lifecycle management</p>
      <p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:03:59.280">of the whole collection of resources that make-up this logical entity that you're interested in grouping</p>
      <p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:04.260">together so you get the ability to deploy them all together and I'll show you how we support</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.260" end="00:04:07.070">declared of deployment of resource groups you get</p>
      <p begin="00:04:07.070" end="00:04:11.290">to update them together so if you got updates that span a bunch of these</p>
      <p begin="00:04:11.290" end="00:04:15.730">resource instances those updates can be done through single api is into as</p>
      <p begin="00:04:15.730" end="00:04:20.530">a resource manager you-can delete the whole research group together so this is a way for you to say I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:04:20.530" end="00:04:23.870">done with all these this application of this part of this application</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.870" end="00:04:27.620">...delete it all of the constituent resources</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.620" end="00:04:32.320">get deleted automatically and then you can create the status of the resource group the aggregated status research group</p>
      <p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:36.650">and you can drill into the resource group and query their status as well?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:36.650" end="00:04:38.390">This groupings useful...other places to,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.390" end="00:04:43.310">for example, you're going to cs add more and more capabilities around putting</p>
      <p begin="00:04:43.310" end="00:04:47.780">...meter ing and quotas on resource groups you can say that this resource group can only</p>
      <p begin="00:04:47.780" end="00:04:52.630">create and number of...and no more...create x amount of storage</p>
      <p begin="00:04:52.630" end="00:04:57.680">in storage accounts and no more you'll be able to set billing limits on resource</p>
      <p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:02.820">groups you'll be able to also and this is already there take a look at your</p>
      <p begin="00:05:02.820" end="00:05:07.700">resource group status from this collection perspective from the portals.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:07.700" end="00:05:11.390">To the command lines interfaces to adder to the rest api</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.390" end="00:05:14.840">...as well as powerful and then it's also</p>
      <p begin="00:05:14.840" end="00:05:19.680">scope for our back so this is the way we're introducing our back into the control plains of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:19.680" end="00:05:24.510">address through as a research groups and as a resource manager we can define our back rules that are</p>
      <p begin="00:05:24.510" end="00:05:29.510">scoped to a resource group or to resources or even some resources in a resource group so you</p>
      <p begin="00:05:29.510" end="00:05:32.650">could say that only the owners of the resource group can have</p>
      <p begin="00:05:32.650" end="00:05:36.860">...access to the...m in the resource group, for example.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:36.860" end="00:05:41.130">And, then something that you can cs coming is identity's going to be built into resource groups</p>
      <p begin="00:05:41.130" end="00:05:43.570">to so resource groups will have their own identity provision</p>
      <p begin="00:05:43.570" end="00:05:47.110">and abstracted directory and using this identity all of the resources in that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:47.110" end="00:05:51.410">resource group will have the ability to talk to each other without you having to provide credentials</p>
      <p begin="00:05:51.410" end="00:05:56.660">...or certificates for them to have some identity to talk to outside services they</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56.660" end="00:06:01.540">will appear as first-class principles measure active directory this will allow them to talk to</p>
      <p begin="00:06:01.540" end="00:06:04.640">each other these resources inside the research group as well as</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.640" end="00:06:11.440">to outside resources that are able to speak...off protocol to interact with these.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:15.390">And, one of the questions that I often get when I talk about research group says I've got some resources</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.390" end="00:06:19.890">...I put them in a research group versus put them in separate resource groups an answer that question is</p>
      <p begin="00:06:19.890" end="00:06:23.930">actually fairly simple and straightforward do they have common lifecycle</p>
      <p begin="00:06:23.930" end="00:06:28.160">and management operations that you want to perform on them if, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:28.160" end="00:06:33.400">you've got a marketing database and you've got to front-ends to that maybe</p>
      <p begin="00:06:33.400" end="00:06:38.220">one is an internal front-end that's going and putting data in the marketing database and the other</p>
      <p begin="00:06:38.220" end="00:06:43.600">one is customer-facing application that's also making use of that data and marketing database</p>
      <p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:48.000">well those are three different resources that likely have different life cycles and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:51.530">...want to put those each in the separate resource groups</p>
      <p begin="00:06:51.530" end="00:06:56.330">...front-ends though might have their own middle tears that are part of them that are part of that</p>
      <p begin="00:06:56.330" end="00:07:01.950">...that front-end so...to put those inside the same resource group.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.950" end="00:07:05.740">The resource group manager services so resource group manager there's a front-end to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.740" end="00:07:10.440">adders called research group manager and it provides a bunch of services</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.440" end="00:07:14.960">that all of the resources there part of this model get for free, for example, centralize auditing of</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:19.780">operations because it is the control plane badger you get basically a</p>
      <p begin="00:07:19.780" end="00:07:23.350">...log of all the control...operations and I've got a screenshot</p>
      <p begin="00:07:23.350" end="00:07:28.320">...from the...portal showing you that you get tagging...resources</p>
      <p begin="00:07:28.320" end="00:07:33.450">sell this is useful if you want to be able to tag resources</p>
      <p begin="00:07:33.450" end="00:07:37.680">...perform queries like which resources are tagged marketing department because</p>
      <p begin="00:07:37.680" end="00:07:41.240">knows resources are related whatever the marketing departments doing and you can</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.240" end="00:07:46.160">buy tagging resources do those kinds of queries this tagging will also be integrated</p>
      <p begin="00:07:46.160" end="00:07:51.220">in the billing systems so that you can go and say how much did the marketing department cost me last month and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:51.220" end="00:07:56.160">by evaluating those tags and looking at the bills for...resources over the last month you'll see</p>
      <p begin="00:07:56.160" end="00:08:01.060">a summary of how much that cost you and then finally like I mentioned it's a consistent place for</p>
      <p begin="00:08:01.060" end="00:08:05.620">our back with the...member built-in roles and research providers can define are only</p>
      <p begin="00:08:05.620" end="00:08:09.110">rules and get that for themselves for their own resource types all</p>
      <p begin="00:08:09.110" end="00:08:16.200">implementing a consistent way through this control...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:16.200" end="00:08:20.960">One of the most exciting parts about resource...for me is the fact that it's got template</p>
      <p begin="00:08:20.960" end="00:08:26.020">...deployments so you can interact with resource manager using rest api</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.020" end="00:08:30.990">and perform imperative operations the build-up a resource group so, for example, you can say go creative</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30.990" end="00:08:35.120">...and creative storage account both in the same resource group but</p>
      <p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:38.830">were moved into a world where imperative creation</p>
      <p begin="00:08:38.830" end="00:08:43.390">of resources of applications is something that is</p>
      <p begin="00:08:43.390" end="00:08:49.030">...reproduce double and fragile so we've gone to at least within manager a</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.030" end="00:08:53.950">more declarative approach to defining what applications look like and what</p>
      <p begin="00:08:53.950" end="00:08:58.290">...approach comes the template describes exactly what you want</p>
      <p begin="00:08:58.290" end="00:09:02.730">the application to look like in this case a resource group so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:02.730" end="00:09:07.470">I want...website with the database and I want to database connection string to go into</p>
      <p begin="00:09:07.470" end="00:09:11.440">a input parameter on that website instead of me having to do something out</p>
      <p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:15.110">of banned by putting this in a template I can describe those</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.110" end="00:09:21.050">relationships and give it to add resource manager I can parameterized the template so</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.050" end="00:09:25.800">that I can deploy into multiple places and get the same experience everywhere I go</p>
      <p begin="00:09:25.800" end="00:09:30.370">just by supplying different parameters depending on environment so I can deployed into a test environment</p>
      <p begin="00:09:30.370" end="00:09:33.560">which test parameters I can deploy to production environment with</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.560" end="00:09:38.500">production and parameters I might want a single instance version of</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.500" end="00:09:42.700">my application in...production I want to be multi and since for scale</p>
      <p begin="00:09:42.700" end="00:09:46.740">out for availability and I can do that just by changing parameters but the template</p>
      <p begin="00:09:46.740" end="00:09:54.700">itself describing the structure of the application is unchanged and I can check...source control?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:54.700" end="00:09:58.120">The way that...template execution works as a resource manager takes a look</p>
      <p begin="00:09:58.120" end="00:10:02.220">and this is another advantage of having something that's...rather than imperative is that the as</p>
      <p begin="00:10:02.220" end="00:10:05.880">a resource manager can examine the relationship between the resources that are in</p>
      <p begin="00:10:05.880" end="00:10:09.150">the template and find the fastest path forward</p>
      <p begin="00:10:09.150" end="00:10:13.480">to get that operations executed so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:13.480" end="00:10:18.290">I've got an app service plan which is what I deploy web apps and logic apps</p>
      <p begin="00:10:18.290" end="00:10:21.460">onto I might...website on to it I put</p>
      <p begin="00:10:21.460" end="00:10:26.590">auto scaling on top of that after that completes there's some dependencies that...some resources the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:26.590" end="00:10:31.580">head dependencies on that website coming up like app insights on alert rule on the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:31.580" end="00:10:34.100">website cpu usage and maybe a</p>
      <p begin="00:10:34.100" end="00:10:38.540">...microsoft deploy packages depending on the website coming up before that those can activate</p>
      <p begin="00:10:38.540" end="00:10:42.910">and then that all completes and you can see some of these deployment some of these activation</p>
      <p begin="00:10:42.910" end="00:10:47.170">...done in parallel other ones were cereal you did not have to worry about that simply by</p>
      <p begin="00:10:47.170" end="00:10:49.510">specifying a relationships and resource manager</p>
      <p begin="00:10:49.510" end="00:10:54.560">takes care that for you so let's take a quick look at the built-in support</p>
      <p begin="00:10:54.560" end="00:10:58.580">fragile resource managers that is...visual studio so enabling to get started with</p>
      <p begin="00:10:58.580" end="00:11:01.480">resource manages really easily.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:01.480" end="00:11:08.280">And, to do that I'm going to go to a new project here...the cloud section.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:08.280" end="00:11:12.480">You can see that there's this as your resource group here unlit</p>
      <p begin="00:11:12.480" end="00:11:15.010">...the default name.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:15.010" end="00:11:18.600">And, visual studio has some canned resource templates</p>
      <p begin="00:11:18.600" end="00:11:23.730">based built into it...web app...because this shows us a multi</p>
      <p begin="00:11:23.730" end="00:11:30.280">...type application described as a resource group.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:30.280" end="00:11:34.090">Alfie go over here to the casual resource group</p>
      <p begin="00:11:34.090" end="00:11:36.990">solution I can click on the jason describing.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:38.240" end="00:11:43.120">That application and this is the template underneath a database plus</p>
      <p begin="00:11:43.120" end="00:11:46.860">a sequel server over here we see adjacent outline which is</p>
      <p begin="00:11:46.860" end="00:11:51.180">convenient chameleon allows me to look at the resource types that are inside of this</p>
      <p begin="00:11:51.180" end="00:11:55.560">template and there's a number of them in addition to the ones that seem obvious like the website</p>
      <p begin="00:11:55.560" end="00:11:59.970">in the database we've got a sequel server and we've got a database and you can see as a click</p>
      <p begin="00:11:59.970" end="00:12:04.770">...navigating through the...you can see here's a resource.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:04.770" end="00:12:09.210">And, there's some interesting things to note here, for example, the type this is a database type it's actually</p>
      <p begin="00:12:09.210" end="00:12:11.820">a subset of the microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:12:11.820" end="00:12:15.450">sequel name space it's.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:15.450" end="00:12:20.600">Going to...specific locations so I...resource groups that spanned multiple locations meaning multiple as a</p>
      <p begin="00:12:20.600" end="00:12:23.580">regions I can say this thing goes to east us</p>
      <p begin="00:12:23.580" end="00:12:29.390">and this other database part of the same template that goes to west us and that will allow me to create and a single</p>
      <p begin="00:12:29.390" end="00:12:34.470">Dr or highly available application that spans regions and asher and then you can see</p>
      <p begin="00:12:34.470" end="00:12:39.270">properties down here with references to what are called parameters...take a look at what</p>
      <p begin="00:12:39.270" end="00:12:44.180">parameters are like I mentioned you parameterized your resource group and this</p>
      <p begin="00:12:44.180" end="00:12:49.210">allows you to customize it customize this template for whatever environment...to</p>
      <p begin="00:12:49.210" end="00:12:55.030">...references here like, for example, I the size of the worker.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:55.030" end="00:12:58.270">In the website...how big in the worker role be</p>
      <p begin="00:12:58.270" end="00:13:02.240">...the worker be rather you see the allowed values are zero one and two it's a type</p>
      <p begin="00:13:02.240" end="00:13:07.010">...the default value...so...no parameters to specified here's the default but it</p>
      <p begin="00:13:07.010" end="00:13:14.740">also any tooling can look at this and know that it's going to enforce the I don't put a three and there.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:14.740" end="00:13:16.950">Now what I'm going to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:16.950" end="00:13:19.350">Here is to show you just what how</p>
      <p begin="00:13:19.350" end="00:13:24.260">...visual studio healthy deployed this thing so I've created</p>
      <p begin="00:13:24.260" end="00:13:28.840">an provision my asher subscription here and when I go to ploy it one of the things that can ask</p>
      <p begin="00:13:28.840" end="00:13:33.660">...for the new resource group name but I can also at the parameters right here inside...visual studio so this is</p>
      <p begin="00:13:33.660" end="00:13:38.000">looking the template and saying hey you need to provide somebody's values you can see the worker size here was</p>
      <p begin="00:13:38.000" end="00:13:43.120">default to zero and specified in that parameter section of the template?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:51.730">So, let's switch back to the powerpoint and get a little more detailed about.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:51.730" end="00:13:53.650">In those templates so quickly just</p>
      <p begin="00:13:53.650" end="00:13:57.040">to review there's some things that you saw in their parameters those.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:57.040" end="00:14:00.860">Are the temple ties to parameters that allow us to specify values from the outside</p>
      <p begin="00:14:00.860" end="00:14:02.530">...configuration file</p>
      <p begin="00:14:02.530" end="00:14:07.180">...variables which are basically macros of values that I can then</p>
      <p begin="00:14:07.180" end="00:14:11.010">use multiple places inside the template instead of having to put the same expressions all over the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.010" end="00:14:16.570">place the resources that we mention and then there's output values so templates can produce output</p>
      <p begin="00:14:16.570" end="00:14:22.360">values that then can be looked at through tooling or through...will tell us what are the interesting things that came out,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:22.360" end="00:14:25.480">for example, when I go to ploy website what's the url</p>
      <p begin="00:14:25.480" end="00:14:28.650">...the website the popped out of that resource group template as</p>
      <p begin="00:14:28.650" end="00:14:33.500">...that can be and output parameter emitted by the website itself internet</p>
      <p begin="00:14:33.500" end="00:14:36.390">research group and I can go take a look inside of a portal,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:36.390" end="00:14:41.470">for example, to see what url to hit to see that website?</p>
      <p begin="00:14:41.470" end="00:14:45.630">And, then there's some dsl that you'll see here and templates that allow us to do some</p>
      <p begin="00:14:45.630" end="00:14:50.180">create expressions, for example, one of them is this parameters expression which</p>
      <p begin="00:14:50.180" end="00:14:54.870">references a parameter you can see this reference from the second one up there that</p>
      <p begin="00:14:54.870" end="00:14:59.730">lets us reference and output value from one resource into another one so that...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:59.730" end="00:15:04.610">string that sql connections...mentioned I want to reference from the website configuration for</p>
      <p begin="00:15:04.610" end="00:15:09.260">sql connection string the output of the sequel database which is going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:15:09.260" end="00:15:15.030">...connection strength and that I do with the reference value.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:15.030" end="00:15:19.290">So, that's a quick overview of as a resource manager let's talk about some of the announcements</p>
      <p begin="00:15:19.290" end="00:15:23.680">we're making here build today which are really exciting surround the new support for virtual machines</p>
      <p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:28.700">storage networking api as part of this resource manager family.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:28.700" end="00:15:32.740">Up to today we've had a number of resources already</p>
      <p begin="00:15:32.740" end="00:15:35.250">plug-in as resource manager use saw websites you saw</p>
      <p begin="00:15:35.250" end="00:15:39.980">...database an example I just showed you read...caches another one there's forty more.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:39.980" end="00:15:43.270">Microsoft first party and like I mentioned some third-party like...grid,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:43.270" end="00:15:48.210">for example, is a third-party research provider so you can provision a send grid endpoint</p>
      <p begin="00:15:48.210" end="00:15:52.720">as part of a template and that would then allow your website to be able to send</p>
      <p begin="00:15:52.720" end="00:15:57.420">email without you having to go provision that yourself?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:57.420" end="00:16:01.680">There's also version one of network storage and networking api is built</p>
      <p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:08.120">...resource manager today but let's talk about what's new about version...</p>
      <p begin="00:16:08.120" end="00:16:11.820">So, version one you can go and if you create and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:11.820" end="00:16:16.260">the portal which I'll show you...minute resource group you will see or virtual,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:16.260" end="00:16:20.660">virtual machine of read vone tight it will go into a resource group</p>
      <p begin="00:16:20.660" end="00:16:25.220">but it's not a first-class citizen as a resource manager so it has no</p>
      <p begin="00:16:25.220" end="00:16:28.980">are back support has no tagging support has no templates it's really kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:16:28.980" end="00:16:34.950">a visual visualization a kind of weak...resource into the resource group and it's got</p>
      <p begin="00:16:34.950" end="00:16:40.130">clunky network modeling if you familiar with our networking api is maybe wanted to have</p>
      <p begin="00:16:40.130" end="00:16:45.030">...for example, that was separate from a virtual machine or load balance or that was separate</p>
      <p begin="00:16:45.030" end="00:16:49.810">from a scale-up set of virtual machines you didn't have that option those were baked into</p>
      <p begin="00:16:49.810" end="00:16:55.120">the compute model so what we've got with version to is...direct integration</p>
      <p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:16:59.890">and measure resource manager so all of the things I'm talking about with as a resource manager just light up</p>
      <p begin="00:16:59.890" end="00:17:04.200">you get...control plane now that we put in here under</p>
      <p begin="00:17:04.200" end="00:17:10.520">for to implement these resource types which overcome some of the serialism asian.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:10.520" end="00:17:11.330">Limitations</p>
      <p begin="00:17:11.330" end="00:17:15.970">aversion one implementation so if you've ever done multiple operations maybe had a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.970" end="00:17:20.890">lock where you couldn't go update your cloud service because something was in progress you want to add a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:20.890" end="00:17:25.010">...virtual machine that the virtual machine those are all gone everything</p>
      <p begin="00:17:25.010" end="00:17:29.250">is fully asynchronous so you can go be modifying virtual machines...modifying</p>
      <p begin="00:17:29.250" end="00:17:34.210">...network adapters for them while you're at modifying that virtual disks for them at the same time all of that is</p>
      <p begin="00:17:34.210" end="00:17:37.250">than just asynchronous operations you...the control</p>
      <p begin="00:17:37.250" end="00:17:41.710">...and then really excited to say that these new api</p>
      <p begin="00:17:41.710" end="00:17:45.200">or part of the agile consistent private cloud experience that we're</p>
      <p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:50.420">...that were committed delivering and I'll talk more about that in a second.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:50.420" end="00:17:55.990">Like right now let's go take a look at these new api...</p>
      <p begin="00:17:55.990" end="00:17:58.950">So, we'll switch over the demo machine.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:58.950" end="00:18:04.980">Now what I've got is template here this is a coffee shop application</p>
      <p begin="00:18:04.980" end="00:18:09.150">and I've got the temple here in visual studio if I click open you can see there's a bunch of resources</p>
      <p begin="00:18:09.150" end="00:18:13.560">in here we see a sequel server we...website just like we saw before but here we see version</p>
      <p begin="00:18:13.560" end="00:18:17.880">two of these virtual machines we see the next as well and</p>
      <p begin="00:18:17.880" end="00:18:22.730">when I click on the virtual machine we can see that these are fully parameterized so I can see I</p>
      <p begin="00:18:22.730" end="00:18:27.200">parameterized the size of the virtual machine right here I parameterized things like the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:32.070">admin user account and password so these are going to be ask for the time a deploy the template</p>
      <p begin="00:18:32.070" end="00:18:35.810">I even specified where this...go into what storage</p>
      <p begin="00:18:35.810" end="00:18:40.210">account planner parameterized way and then there's a variable here macro basically...source</p>
      <p begin="00:18:40.210" end="00:18:46.610">...image id if I go to source...image ideas variable?</p>
      <p begin="00:18:46.610" end="00:18:51.560">You can see that this is a concatenation of some subscription information and then there's</p>
      <p begin="00:18:51.560" end="00:18:56.200">a parameter here when source image name so it's actually going to ask me when I</p>
      <p begin="00:18:56.200" end="00:18:58.460">deploy this thing what the...source image</p>
      <p begin="00:18:58.460" end="00:19:03.300">name is but there's a default and you can see that's a linux virtual...</p>
      <p begin="00:19:03.300" end="00:19:07.990">sorry click on the wrong one here you can see this is a windows virtual machine this is server twenty-four</p>
      <p begin="00:19:07.990" end="00:19:13.940">...so there's defaults here specified I can overrule them specify other images.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:13.940" end="00:19:19.010">Now I'm...this empower...here's the our...command...to deploy an as a</p>
      <p begin="00:19:19.010" end="00:19:23.370">...group you can see...this one mark copies...copy twenty-four</p>
      <p begin="00:19:23.370" end="00:19:27.730">and specifying east us here's the jason file and then.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:27.730" end="00:19:30.330">I'm specifying as part of this deployment a</p>
      <p begin="00:19:30.330" end="00:19:33.690">parameters file so let's go take a look at that parameters file.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:33.690" end="00:19:37.510">Which is right here and I've simply filled in those values that are required like I</p>
      <p begin="00:19:37.510" end="00:19:42.410">mentioned the admin the username...password you can see there's no password there because I didn't want to show you what</p>
      <p begin="00:19:42.410" end="00:19:49.800">password really is but if I press a five now this is...</p>
      <p begin="00:19:49.800" end="00:19:51.660">I've got a switch to.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:51.660" end="00:19:54.800">As a resource manager...here.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:54.800" end="00:20:02.340">And, I press a five and now this is going to be launching.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:02.340" end="00:20:07.180">...us I'm not going...wait for that to finish I've already deployed one of these resource groups of that</p>
      <p begin="00:20:07.180" end="00:20:12.070">template here...copy...copy...being deployed</p>
      <p begin="00:20:12.070" end="00:20:16.930">...click on...coffee and let's take a look at the resources that are part of it that match the template</p>
      <p begin="00:20:16.930" end="00:20:21.540">so a click on resources here's the list a resources exactly like with on</p>
      <p begin="00:20:21.540" end="00:20:25.960">a template like exactly like we saw in visual studio down here you can see there's a</p>
      <p begin="00:20:25.960" end="00:20:29.920">storage account so this is the version to the storage control</p>
      <p begin="00:20:29.920" end="00:20:34.200">...here's the blob and there's one blob in that account</p>
      <p begin="00:20:34.200" end="00:20:39.040">and that is storing of the hd here which you saw the full parameters</p>

      <p begin="00:24:30.360" end="00:24:35.970">sets introduces is this is basically next generation worker role you don't need to put your on</p>
      <p begin="00:24:35.970" end="00:24:40.130">...in there it's basically exactly as avert virtual machine excepted stateless and</p>
      <p begin="00:24:40.130" end="00:24:43.900">...can scale it out very easily you can start with the...image</p>

      <p begin="00:24:55.210" end="00:24:59.070">speaking of clusters...here's just a little graphic to show you these things</p>
      <p begin="00:24:59.070" end="00:25:03.020">scaling up but speaking of clusters.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:03.020" end="00:25:07.820">Let's talk about virtual machine extensions and how this enables third-party</p>
      <p begin="00:25:07.820" end="00:25:12.630">cluster orchestrate...to layer on top of asher with virtual machine extensions</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.630" end="00:25:15.760">you've got the ability to dynamically inject coding configuration</p>
      <p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:20.510">...virtual machines either at the time that the virtual machines provision or even afterwards and you can even update the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:20.510" end="00:25:25.700">coder configuration we previewed this ll basically about a year-ago and this is part of</p>
      <p begin="00:25:25.700" end="00:25:30.620">the new virtual machine api as well you can stick things in like chef and</p>
      <p begin="00:25:30.620" end="00:25:35.420">puppet and ds see you can stick and things like monitoring agents back-up agents we just announced</p>
      <p begin="00:25:35.420" end="00:25:39.610">...back-up service for...virtual machines which make use of the back-up</p>
      <p begin="00:25:39.610" end="00:25:42.070">...extensions to inject back-up agent you can</p>
      <p begin="00:25:42.070" end="00:25:46.800">stick security agents in there that do bit locker encryption the do math basically the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:46.800" end="00:25:51.600">...left imagination for what kind of code you want to layer and the benefit of extensions is that you don't</p>
      <p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:56.200">have to...this stuff into...image you can take any stock image...compatible</p>
      <p begin="00:25:56.200" end="00:26:01.280">...extensions and layer them on after the fact so no more having to go and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:01.280" end="00:26:07.840">have image sprawl just because you want to monitor agent inside of your images?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:10.950">Now what this enables is for third-party cluster</p>
      <p begin="00:26:10.950" end="00:26:14.450">...paths application frameworks to put their own</p>
      <p begin="00:26:14.450" end="00:26:19.440">to bootstrap themselves into these virtual machines using virtual machine extensions and again they don't have to bake all this stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:26:19.440" end="00:26:21.670">...the virtual machine they can take a</p>
      <p begin="00:26:21.670" end="00:26:26.580">advantage of the extension model to get themselves bootstrap and they also</p>
      <p begin="00:26:26.580" end="00:26:33.180">...get the benefit of having anything else that works is an extension work side-by-side with them like anti-virus.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:33.180" end="00:26:37.360">You can see here...growing upthere's support for...right scale</p>
      <p begin="00:26:37.360" end="00:26:41.910">...swarm clusters and then those can bring in their own paths layers on top</p>
      <p begin="00:26:41.910" end="00:26:46.290">because those are cluster orchestration systems that paths.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:46.290" end="00:26:49.170">Application frameworks layer on top of like a print the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:49.170" end="00:26:52.410">...elastic marathon or some examples now what I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:26:52.410" end="00:26:56.440">going to show announce here is through a great partnership with</p>

      <p begin="00:27:19.020" end="00:27:25.150">got right here is showing you get hub with amazes sphere template here?</p>
      <p begin="00:27:25.150" end="00:27:29.490">...core here there's...sanders you just modified this an hour ago</p>

      <p begin="00:27:34.740" end="00:27:35.670">And, what we</p>
      <p begin="00:27:35.670" end="00:27:40.750">see here is that plus that template for amazes your cluster so this is a highly available</p>
      <p begin="00:27:40.750" end="00:27:45.260">measures for cluster that you can play with this thing if I scroll down the interesting thing</p>
      <p begin="00:27:45.260" end="00:27:49.590">...the interesting part here is how do we make this thing up high scale cluster</p>
      <p begin="00:27:49.590" end="00:27:54.490">...here's a type microsoft virtual machines you can see that it takes a</p>
      <p begin="00:27:54.490" end="00:27:59.130">...a parameter takes allocation of parameter but then it's got this interesting thing which is a new addition to</p>
      <p begin="00:27:59.130" end="00:28:03.160">...a resource manager which is the ability to basically create loops over</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.160" end="00:28:09.180">resource instantiation so this is the master vm loop for the master nodes and that</p>
      <p begin="00:28:09.180" end="00:28:12.690">...a sphere cluster and account is parameterized so I can say</p>
      <p begin="00:28:12.690" end="00:28:14.940">that I want ten or three?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:19.210">...a sphere masters I can say what one because I'm just doing</p>
      <p begin="00:28:19.210" end="00:28:25.260">...and I don't want a big deployment and you can see some dependencies on some other resources zinger and</p>
      <p begin="00:28:25.260" end="00:28:27.900">down...os profile you can see an example of somebody</p>
      <p begin="00:28:27.900" end="00:28:32.920">extension support we've added which is custom data gets piped into the virtual machine through a cloud</p>
      <p begin="00:28:32.920" end="00:28:37.400">...type interface so that this gets bootstrap them is a sphere master gets</p>
      <p begin="00:28:37.400" end="00:28:39.990">dropped on-base...image again so that may</p>
      <p begin="00:28:39.990" end="00:28:44.830">...a sphere doesn't have to continue to maintain a ios images with...for big</p>
      <p begin="00:28:44.830" end="00:28:52.010">...you can dynamic you can pick amazes ...image...deploy the cluster into that image.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:52.010" end="00:28:55.350">So, let's go take a look at that means a sphere cluster I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:28:55.350" end="00:28:58.170">to go back to that and we've built in</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58.170" end="00:29:02.990">...deployment experience right from get hub for all of the templates and you'll see that we've</p>
      <p begin="00:29:02.990" end="00:29:07.820">public...create created probably a hundred templates now that are up and get hub</p>
      <p begin="00:29:07.820" end="00:29:11.870">they're all have this...as your button on it so once uses the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:11.870" end="00:29:18.530">setup your as your subscription information you get this kind of experience which will open</p>
      <p begin="00:29:18.530" end="00:29:23.390">a template up now if I'm happy with this template I say save.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:23.390" end="00:29:28.260">And, then I go back to add a parameters and you see here the parameters that I need to enter so</p>
      <p begin="00:29:28.260" end="00:29:31.860">some of them like the number of this slaves.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:33.060" end="00:29:36.520">The number...and we're going to deploy a cluster with a hundred slaves.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:37.700" end="00:29:44.390">And, down here we need...pipe in some sh data.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:44.390" end="00:29:47.580">Actually I'm going to just go and skip that because I've already got this cluster</p>
      <p begin="00:29:47.580" end="00:29:52.530">...cluster like this already deployed but I'd specify these other two parameters press ok and this would start</p>
      <p begin="00:29:52.530" end="00:29:56.020">a deployment of a hundred vm amazes your</p>
      <p begin="00:29:56.020" end="00:30:01.930">cluster to asher but let's go...take a look.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:01.930" end="00:30:07.480">By going to measure portal at the predeployed one that I've got.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:07.480" end="00:30:11.440">And, we're going to play...a little playing around amazes your cluster to show you how cool</p>
      <p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:15.610">is to have a container cluster orchestrate or on top of measure virtual</p>
      <p begin="00:30:15.610" end="00:30:21.220">machines so I've got here this one here dc os.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:21.220" end="00:30:25.080">And, you can see...got two hundred twelve resources these are all the resources including</p>
      <p begin="00:30:25.080" end="00:30:28.500">next virtual machines this the masters in the slaves.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:34.510">That are part of this deployment now I want to interact with this cluster so I've deployed it but now I need</p>
      <p begin="00:30:34.510" end="00:30:36.180">to interactive the management...to</p>
      <p begin="00:30:36.180" end="00:30:42.650">at and I can go and find out where the management interface is by looking at the.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:42.650" end="00:30:47.410">Deployment history for this thing which has the template output parameters and you can see there's three</p>
      <p begin="00:30:47.410" end="00:30:51.140">masters that each spit out their own urls.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:51.140" end="00:30:53.070">Now I don't know which one is</p>
      <p begin="00:30:53.070" end="00:30:56.500">...true master of this cluster because one of those three is the master</p>
      <p begin="00:30:56.500" end="00:31:01.910">...three for fail over purposes now there's a fifty chance I think the right one</p>
      <p begin="00:31:01.910" end="00:31:07.570">actually that doesn't make any sense does it there's a one-in-three chance I think the right one but it's port fifty</p>
      <p begin="00:31:07.570" end="00:31:12.480">the things listening on and you can see a picked the wrong one and now it's redirected me to the amazes</p>
      <p begin="00:31:12.480" end="00:31:16.490">...master and now I'm looking at the amazes cluster management interface</p>
      <p begin="00:31:16.490" end="00:31:20.140">...dc os brings to the table is a higher-level</p>
      <p begin="00:31:20.140" end="00:31:32.490">management interface on top amazes clusters and I can get to that.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:32.490" end="00:31:36.690">And, now I'm looking at the dc os dashboard which shows me the overall cluster</p>
      <p begin="00:31:36.690" end="00:31:42.750">utilization I can see the all the nodes that are part that cluster and their specific civilizations</p>
      <p begin="00:31:42.750" end="00:31:46.180">What I want to do is?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:46.180" end="00:31:48.090">Take a look at.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:48.090" end="00:31:52.400">The custom a custom viewer as a deploy a bunch of container to this and we've created a dc</p>
      <p begin="00:31:52.400" end="00:31:54.990">os visualize are working with the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:54.990" end="00:32:00.750">...sphere team which will show us container starting up and when I?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:00.750" end="00:32:06.870">Come back here...I'm going to do is add the marathon application framework.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:06.870" end="00:32:08.570">To that cluster and this is</p>
      <p begin="00:32:08.570" end="00:32:15.900">already pointing at that cluster that I just got deployed I'm going to add the spark which is another application model.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:15.900" end="00:32:22.420">...the ads.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:22.420" end="00:32:28.210">And, now I'm going to launch thousand marathon instances.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:28.210" end="00:32:32.250">And, I'm an adult launch a thousand spark instances so these are all going</p>
      <p begin="00:32:32.250" end="00:32:36.990">into darker containers on top of those virtual machines.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:36.990" end="00:32:40.850">On top of asher...this little visualize are shows you just how quickly.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:40.850" end="00:32:42.450">These tasks.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:42.450" end="00:32:51.620">These application containers get deployed in launched onto that means...cluster.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:56.180" end="00:33:04.330">I think that was amazes your guys clapping all right so let's switch back to the presentation.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:04.330" end="00:33:08.590">So, that's a look at cluster orchestrated is on top of that foundation</p>
      <p begin="00:33:08.590" end="00:33:13.520">of virtual machines virtual machine extensions on top of measure resource manager with templates</p>
      <p begin="00:33:13.520" end="00:33:16.740">...you into and I already by the way talked a little</p>
      <p begin="00:33:16.740" end="00:33:20.770">...containers this morning and the keno demo any people saw that</p>
      <p begin="00:33:20.770" end="00:33:25.380">so consuming everybody did some...windows containers and,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:25.380" end="00:33:30.720">linux...with integrated doctor support there's a full container session that we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:33:30.720" end="00:33:35.620">windows server containers tomorrow late afternoon so I'm not going to</p>
      <p begin="00:33:35.620" end="00:33:39.630">spend time here but one of the great things about containers is that</p>
      <p begin="00:33:39.630" end="00:33:44.560">they're great for micros service-based applications and let me just stop here for a second and talk about what</p>
      <p begin="00:33:44.560" end="00:33:49.490">is a micros service-based application...space application is one</p>
      <p begin="00:33:49.490" end="00:33:54.020">...application decomposed into tiny parts and you decompose...parts for a</p>
      <p begin="00:33:54.020" end="00:33:58.860">few reasons one is that you can test them in isolation they can run</p>
      <p begin="00:33:58.860" end="00:34:03.530">...isolation when they put them in a container you can make sure that when it works on your deb box it works</p>
      <p begin="00:34:03.530" end="00:34:07.050">and production box at as well now</p>
      <p begin="00:34:07.050" end="00:34:11.530">by a decomposing into this fine-grain units you want to create</p>
      <p begin="00:34:11.530" end="00:34:16.190">kind of rigorous interfaces between one of the microsoft...and the other microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:34:16.190" end="00:34:19.590">...the application and that also helps you evolve those different</p>
      <p begin="00:34:19.590" end="00:34:24.350">party application independently...strong contracts as long as you don't break the contract you can</p>
      <p begin="00:34:24.350" end="00:34:27.120">change the implementation underneath the hood and even</p>
      <p begin="00:34:27.120" end="00:34:32.600">add new functionality without breaking the other microsoft...that are depending on it and then have this</p>
      <p begin="00:34:32.600" end="00:34:37.550">kind of organic growth of the application in a very lightweight and decentralized</p>
      <p begin="00:34:37.550" end="00:34:42.430">...you can also update them independently so if you make a change the one microsoft with your not</p>
      <p begin="00:34:42.430" end="00:34:47.200">impacting...application you can scale amount independently so</p>
      <p begin="00:34:47.200" end="00:34:52.150">instead of having to take giant blocks that are all a whole bunch of stuff inside of it</p>
      <p begin="00:34:52.150" end="00:34:57.150">you just want to scale-up because you hit a limit on one of the application...in that big monolithic</p>
      <p begin="00:34:57.150" end="00:35:02.180">block you want to scale out just the microsoft...that needs to be scaled...that needs more cpu</p>
      <p begin="00:35:02.180" end="00:35:06.850">or more network with and leave everything else alone so it has a</p>
      <p begin="00:35:06.850" end="00:35:11.100">lot of efficiencies for agile development for rapid iteration for</p>
      <p begin="00:35:11.100" end="00:35:15.920">...of management now going and managing all of these micros services</p>
      <p begin="00:35:15.920" end="00:35:21.690">is something that you probably don't want to yourself you want micros service manager to do it for you and</p>
      <p begin="00:35:21.690" end="00:35:26.690">it would even be nice if you had an application platform that understood microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:35:26.690" end="00:35:31.300">...made it easier for you to write applet microsoft...applications and that is</p>
      <p begin="00:35:31.300" end="00:35:36.270">were service fabric comes into play is built on top of that same foundation that we saw them is a</p>
      <p begin="00:35:36.270" end="00:35:40.640">sphere and dc os clusters and these other cluster orchestrated and</p>
      <p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:45.230">paths libraries on top of this is something that we've been working on inside</p>
      <p begin="00:35:45.230" end="00:35:49.350">microsoft for a long-time and it has rich set</p>
      <p begin="00:35:49.350" end="00:35:51.160">of functionality designer on microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:35:51.160" end="00:35:56.000">riff-based applications everything from making sure that is highly available</p>
      <p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:36:00.740">its template...just like we...resource manager you describe a template of your micros</p>
      <p begin="00:36:00.740" end="00:36:05.410">service-based application and that allows service fabric to look at what you</p>
      <p begin="00:36:05.410" end="00:36:09.060">want and make sure that you're getting what you want if you want three</p>
      <p begin="00:36:09.060" end="00:36:13.960">replicas of your front-end microsoft's and a virtual machine goes down</p>
      <p begin="00:36:13.960" end="00:36:17.830">it's service fabric is going to make sure that it's going to migrate and create that</p>
      <p begin="00:36:17.830" end="00:36:21.230">microsoft third one they got impacted</p>
      <p begin="00:36:21.230" end="00:36:25.060">for-you without you having to go worry about that it supports partitioning</p>
      <p begin="00:36:25.060" end="00:36:29.070">for scale-up and I'll talk more about...supports rolling upgrades of microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:36:29.070" end="00:36:34.020">...so if you got those three front-ends you don't want to just blasting update all three of them you want to do</p>
      <p begin="00:36:34.020" end="00:36:38.070">it in a careful way that provides availability and safety by doing</p>
      <p begin="00:36:38.070" end="00:36:43.300">...one of my top one-at-a-time and if there's a problem with health watchdogs built into service fabric</p>
      <p begin="00:36:43.300" end="00:36:48.370">...ones that you add yourself you can get rollback on top of it?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:48.370" end="00:36:52.620">It supports private clouds as well as private-public clouds as well so you can</p>
      <p begin="00:36:52.620" end="00:36:57.600">put on your own systems you can deploy to asher.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:57.600" end="00:37:02.900">Here's...it's just a subset of the some of the high-level functionality and capabilities of service fabric</p>
      <p begin="00:37:02.900" end="00:37:07.750">I've touched on some of them I talked about rolling update with rollback support strong versioning so it</p>
      <p begin="00:37:07.750" end="00:37:12.440">knows what rollback means because it knows that you're you've got version to of microsoft's</p>
      <p begin="00:37:12.440" end="00:37:15.650">...version one is the last known good one</p>
      <p begin="00:37:15.650" end="00:37:18.590">...support side-by-side support so I can even actually deployed version</p>
      <p begin="00:37:18.590" end="00:37:23.130">tool microsoft's on the same cluster with version one and service fabric will</p>
      <p begin="00:37:23.130" end="00:37:27.280">route requests appropriately depending on what the client lots to talk to version to</p>
      <p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:32.050">...version one in supports leadership election and this is inherent in something</p>
      <p begin="00:37:32.050" end="00:37:36.710">called stateful service staple microsoft support which I'll talk about in a second of course name</p>
      <p begin="00:37:36.710" end="00:37:41.560">discovery that's any cluster orchestrated with containers needs name discovery service...can different parts</p>
      <p begin="00:37:41.560" end="00:37:46.610">the application...each other I mention...supports partitioning support it supports load</p>
      <p begin="00:37:46.610" end="00:37:50.650">balancing placement constraints now this is important if you've got a clustering your</p>
      <p begin="00:37:50.650" end="00:37:52.790">deploying multiple applications to it or a</p>
      <p begin="00:37:52.790" end="00:37:56.500">...complex application with many microsoft mrs you might say</p>
      <p begin="00:37:56.500" end="00:38:00.640">the front-ends can't be on the same servers with the middle tier.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:00.640" end="00:38:04.820">Or some other component because they conflict on resource requirements</p>
      <p begin="00:38:04.820" end="00:38:09.850">or they conflict in some other way so what we'll do is set price constraints to say these microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09.850" end="00:38:14.510">mrs can't be co-located with these other ones you can even do things like these</p>
      <p begin="00:38:14.510" end="00:38:17.540">two need to be together because they actually have a tight interface</p>
      <p begin="00:38:17.540" end="00:38:21.640">...what round-trip communication between them to be as fast as possible so on the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:21.640" end="00:38:25.990">local machine where can be and like I mention this is the only</p>
      <p begin="00:38:25.990" end="00:38:30.530">kind of micros service application platform out there that supports stateful micros</p>
      <p begin="00:38:30.530" end="00:38:35.490">services I'll talk more about what stateful micros services means in a second but this</p>
      <p begin="00:38:35.490" end="00:38:40.100">what we're making available is already like I said been used for five years now inside</p>
      <p begin="00:38:40.100" end="00:38:44.460">...our all of these services for everything from as</p>
      <p begin="00:38:44.460" end="00:38:48.660">your database which is mouths running one-point-four</p>
      <p begin="00:38:48.660" end="00:38:53.400">million customer databases let me just highlight what that means from service</p>
      <p begin="00:38:53.400" end="00:38:58.200">fabric perspective that means tens of thousands a...hundreds of thousands...containers microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:38:58.200" end="00:39:03.170">resp essentially micros services each one of those databases is represented as an instance</p>
      <p begin="00:39:03.170" end="00:39:08.680">of stateful micros services...with either three or four replicas where service fabric is</p>
      <p begin="00:39:08.680" end="00:39:13.460">taking care of all the state management and all of the healing and all of the updating of</p>
      <p begin="00:39:13.460" end="00:39:18.180">those database instances so one-point-four times roughly three that gives you an idea of the number</p>
      <p begin="00:39:18.180" end="00:39:23.260">statefull replica instances that service fabric right now as we speak is keeping healthy</p>
      <p begin="00:39:23.260" end="00:39:27.660">...a cloud down to things like into and core...so core</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.660" end="00:39:32.070">...is supporting...billions requests per second people making</p>
      <p begin="00:39:32.070" end="00:39:38.240">...all of that is going through service fabric and this isn't what we're giving</p>
      <p begin="00:39:38.240" end="00:39:43.000">out as the sdk here today to you which they url should be live about now which I'll show you at the end of</p>
      <p begin="00:39:43.000" end="00:39:47.330">the slide we're not giving you something that is looks like what we run internally for</p>
      <p begin="00:39:47.330" end="00:39:51.570">this stuff we're not getting something that's a rewrite of it we're giving the exact same</p>
      <p begin="00:39:51.570" end="00:39:57.990">bits this sdk that you're getting is the same sdk that all of these services u?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:57.990" end="00:40:01.690">So, that's why examines exciting let me just give you an idea of some of the things that can do</p>
      <p begin="00:40:01.690" end="00:40:06.010">visually so I've got to applications consisting...multiple microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:40:06.010" end="00:40:10.020">...deployed it with placement constraints and load balancing it's gone out to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:10.020" end="00:40:14.400">a cluster of machines now for machine fails service</p>
      <p begin="00:40:14.400" end="00:40:21.470">amicable automatically heal those instances to other.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:21.470" end="00:40:23.620">What is a microsoft...the role of service</p>
      <p begin="00:40:23.620" end="00:40:28.170">...really whatever you want to be a can be...dot net five application it can be</p>
      <p begin="00:40:28.170" end="00:40:32.140">no js application in fact they can just be an arbitrary exhibit you say this</p>
      <p begin="00:40:32.140" end="00:40:37.880">is my microsoft's and take it from here anything you want to be?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:37.880" end="00:40:41.360">And, as I mentioned several times now there's two types of microsoft...that service</p>
      <p begin="00:40:41.360" end="00:40:45.990">fabric supports their stateless microsoft mrs in their stateful microsoft...ones are the ones that</p>
      <p begin="00:40:45.990" end="00:40:50.960">were probably most familiar with...the whole application model that address been pushing towards</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.960" end="00:40:55.440">...a stateless one stateless worker...and web roles and sp dot</p>
      <p begin="00:40:55.440" end="00:41:01.000">net web apps those all external...state to some place else and there's</p>
      <p begin="00:41:01.000" end="00:41:05.980">a need for stateless microsoft mrs in any complex application as your database consistent probably</p>
      <p begin="00:41:05.980" end="00:41:11.650">doesn't micros services and several of them are stateless micros services like front-ends.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:11.650" end="00:41:14.780">Then there's stateful microsoft mrs now here let's talk about what stateful</p>
      <p begin="00:41:14.780" end="00:41:17.460">...means it means that the code...the compute</p>
      <p begin="00:41:17.460" end="00:41:20.830">...co-located together it's not externalizing their</p>
      <p begin="00:41:20.830" end="00:41:25.270">ballad tightly together and the only through this kind of micros service</p>
      <p begin="00:41:25.270" end="00:41:29.950">statefull system can-you insurer high availability and durability</p>
      <p begin="00:41:29.950" end="00:41:35.490">...state and service fabric takes care of that state management for the developer</p>
      <p begin="00:41:35.490" end="00:41:36.510">data...database.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:41.080">Badger database developers they worry about running sequel</p>
      <p begin="00:41:41.080" end="00:41:45.500">...and underneath...diag the they talk to service fabric api is</p>
      <p begin="00:41:45.500" end="00:41:50.320">...sequel that actually wants to make a transaction they call service fabric api and</p>
      <p begin="00:41:50.320" end="00:41:53.570">service fabric api is then take care of</p>

      <p begin="00:42:12.620" end="00:42:16.630">failure anywhere along the way if there's an update...progress on one of the databases so</p>
      <p begin="00:42:16.630" end="00:42:21.360">it's down service fabric takes care of creating new instance in the database</p>
      <p begin="00:42:21.360" end="00:42:25.880">...server and catching that instance up with the primary</p>
      <p begin="00:42:25.880" end="00:42:29.450">and the other surviving secondary or if it's the primary the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:29.450" end="00:42:32.330">...service fabric picks a new primary and</p>
      <p begin="00:42:32.330" end="00:42:37.920">the name service automatically routes requests to the new primary providing a</p>
      <p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:45.330">statefull consistent view of data very easy for this...developers to work on.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:45.330" end="00:42:48.550">Now there's two different...types of api there's multiple program</p>
      <p begin="00:42:48.550" end="00:42:52.890">allows you can put on top of service fabric I'm going to talk about too that were releasing as part of this sdk</p>
      <p begin="00:42:52.890" end="00:42:57.820">one is called the reliable services api and the other one's called the reliable...api</p>
      <p begin="00:42:57.820" end="00:43:02.770">let's talk about the reliable services api those of you are familiar with dot...many of</p>
      <p begin="00:43:02.770" end="00:43:07.080">our dot...to hair-raising...so how many of you have ever used</p>
      <p begin="00:43:07.080" end="00:43:11.980">to dictionary or collection so almost everybody has.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:11.980" end="00:43:13.990">What we're releasing</p>
      <p begin="00:43:13.990" end="00:43:18.270">here are support for reliable collections and reliable</p>
      <p begin="00:43:18.270" end="00:43:23.690">dictionaries basically reliable services using the same?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:23.690" end="00:43:28.180">...that you're familiar with except underneath the hood service fabric is taking care of making</p>
      <p begin="00:43:28.180" end="00:43:34.780">them highly available durable using microsoft these microsoft mrs underneath so reliable</p>
      <p begin="00:43:34.780" end="00:43:38.490">...reliable dictionaries and let's go take a look.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:38.490" end="00:43:46.660">At a demo which you can get right from visual studio.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:46.660" end="00:43:51.570">One of these sample applications so if I go on that visual studio now when you get the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:51.570" end="00:43:56.370">...cancel you'll see service fabric here and I can say application stateless service stateful service</p>
      <p begin="00:43:56.370" end="00:44:04.070">stateless actor servers and stateful actor service of click on statefull service impress ok.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:04.070" end="00:44:08.140">And, then we'll go take a look this has one basically micros services part of it here's the</p>
      <p begin="00:44:08.140" end="00:44:13.060">application manifest so remember I said everything's declarative you can see that this has</p>
      <p begin="00:44:13.060" end="00:44:18.060">one stateful service it's called statefull one is of type</p>
      <p begin="00:44:18.060" end="00:44:20.680">statefull here.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:20.680" end="00:44:22.960">And, it's partition I'll talk more about partition</p>
      <p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:27.420">in a second but we can go take a look at the code for this</p>
      <p begin="00:44:27.420" end="00:44:33.410">...service and this code is right here so this is getting a</p>
      <p begin="00:44:33.410" end="00:44:37.960">reference to a reliable dictionary which is just a key value store here it's</p>
      <p begin="00:44:37.960" end="00:44:42.570">sticking in my dictionary and then what is doing is getting the current</p>
      <p begin="00:44:42.570" end="00:44:45.660">value for the key counter one?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:46.670" end="00:44:50.880">And, then it spitting out that value right here so this will</p>
      <p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:55.510">...service fabrics diagnostic logs that we can see in a second and then</p>
      <p begin="00:44:55.510" end="00:45:00.600">it's adding one here and then...committing this transaction so transactions</p>
      <p begin="00:45:00.600" end="00:45:06.210">are transparent essentially transparent to you can perform multiple operations on multiple</p>
      <p begin="00:45:06.210" end="00:45:07.550">objects.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:07.550" end="00:45:10.360">All underneath this kind of transaction this create transaction.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:11.590" end="00:45:14.010">And, then it's all either committed or documented so I can go up</p>
      <p begin="00:45:14.010" end="00:45:17.310">this object this object do that one minus this.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:17.310" end="00:45:21.610">Say commit and even the whole thing happens or not...happened and</p>
      <p begin="00:45:21.610" end="00:45:27.000">they this failure cases are all handle automatically for-you underneath...</p>
      <p begin="00:45:27.000" end="00:45:29.330">The states are replicated those replicas in</p>
      <p begin="00:45:29.330" end="00:45:33.520">a transaction consistent manner and that's how easy it is to write a statefull</p>
      <p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:38.480">...consistent application with this api</p>
      <p begin="00:45:38.480" end="00:45:49.960">now let's go ahead and deployed this thing so I'm going to deploy it by.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:49.960" end="00:45:58.180">Saying publish.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:58.180" end="00:46:04.850">...need to say deploy.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:04.850" end="00:46:09.020">Actually we just.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:09.020" end="00:46:14.080">...actually I don't...to...so I've got a test cluster set up for this one and</p>
      <p begin="00:46:14.080" end="00:46:15.910">the development cluster and what...do is an</p>
      <p begin="00:46:15.910" end="00:46:20.410">...five sorry and visual studio and what this is going to do start to</p>
      <p begin="00:46:20.410" end="00:46:22.970">...spit up those logs?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:22.970" end="00:46:27.900">Those...fabric diagnostic logs right here individual studio diagnostic events so</p>
      <p begin="00:46:27.900" end="00:46:29.310">we're going to first see those microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:46:29.310" end="00:46:41.780">...that micros in those instances because they're going to...instances deployed.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:41.780" end="00:46:46.100">And, then we're going to start to see counters here.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:46.100" end="00:46:48.610">...counter one counter to counter three.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:48.610" end="00:46:50.020">That's the incrementing of</p>
      <p begin="00:46:50.020" end="00:46:54.570">that reliable dictionary key value and I can go back here individual,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:54.570" end="00:46:58.560">individual studio in the service and I can get.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:58.560" end="00:47:02.400">Debugging of that stateful micros service rights...visual studio so I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:08.600">just hit this you can see I've got all my locals I can step through it so this is distributed</p>
      <p begin="00:47:08.600" end="00:47:12.600">...debugging right from inside a visual studio.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:12.600" end="00:47:16.700">So, let's go back to the powerpoint let me talk a little bit more about some of...capabilities</p>
      <p begin="00:47:16.700" end="00:47:23.170">and show you some demos that a little bit more impressive than some running something in visual studio at least I hope</p>
      <p begin="00:47:23.170" end="00:47:25.410">Microsoft partitioning we know that</p>
      <p begin="00:47:25.410" end="00:47:29.440">we're in a scale out world we're dealing with datasets that are so large that we need to</p>
      <p begin="00:47:29.440" end="00:47:33.510">...we can't scale-up so partitioning is one way that helps us do this having client</p>
      <p begin="00:47:33.510" end="00:47:38.340">...routed to a partition of microsoft...so I can</p>
      <p begin="00:47:38.340" end="00:47:42.500">...microsoft name space and as request come into new partition the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:42.500" end="00:47:47.470">microsoft as instances are automatically...up with by service fabric so you can see here that I've</p>
      <p begin="00:47:47.470" end="00:47:55.570">got one partition with its primary and secondary is another partition serving the same.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:55.570" end="00:48:01.280">With its as well and these get distributed just like any other microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:48:01.280" end="00:48:03.320">Let's go take a look at some of</p>
      <p begin="00:48:03.320" end="00:48:07.350">...action on a larger-scale application how many people noticed just</p>
      <p begin="00:48:07.350" end="00:48:12.370">...curiosity that...always...new always wears a red shirt.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:12.370" end="00:48:15.880">Anybody notice that I so it turns out a lot of people notice</p>
      <p begin="00:48:15.880" end="00:48:21.720">that and there's a lot of people have a lot of debate and discussion about which of</p>
      <p begin="00:48:21.720" end="00:48:24.530">...scott's red shirts of the best.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:24.530" end="00:48:28.240">Over the various events facebook so we created a application</p>
      <p begin="00:48:28.240" end="00:48:30.850">...that's going to let people vote on which</p>
      <p begin="00:48:30.850" end="00:48:35.830">...goo red shirt may like the best and this is the composition is broken down into microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:48:35.830" end="00:48:40.830">...a web your micros service...national service counting micros service which counts up all the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:40.830" end="00:48:46.330">...from all the counties in the country those county services are just keeping track of...in their own</p>
      <p begin="00:48:46.330" end="00:48:52.340">county and then we've got voting services which are generating votes this kind of a...generator for the application so let's</p>
      <p begin="00:48:52.340" end="00:48:58.280">switch to the taking a look at this application.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:58.280" end="00:49:03.730">And, what I'm going to do is open the website here?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:03.730" end="00:49:07.560">And, you can see that I don't have anything running but what I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:49:07.560" end="00:49:12.290">to do is launch this and this is the deploy election from package so I've deployed this</p>
      <p begin="00:49:12.290" end="00:49:14.000">...application by the way here's this guy</p>
      <p begin="00:49:14.000" end="00:49:25.200">go application and I'm going to deploy this and come back and show you.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:25.200" end="00:49:28.120">Now this is a refreshing here and this will come up in a second as</p>
      <p begin="00:49:28.120" end="00:49:33.040">that application of this is being deployed by the way to microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.040" end="00:49:38.960">...to a hundred eighty...up and adder ten...for the initial county's.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38.960" end="00:49:43.630">...gforce for the...scale out...going...do in a minute five</p>
      <p begin="00:49:43.630" end="00:49:46.710">...that are doing the national service level and five</p>
      <p begin="00:49:46.710" end="00:49:49.840">...are the web interface so this is a massively scaled application running</p>
      <p begin="00:49:49.840" end="00:49:55.790">...it's going to be deploying micros services to this cluster to represent this application here</p>
      <p begin="00:49:55.790" end="00:49:58.470">and a second auc this fire up.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:58.470" end="00:50:03.080">And,...start to come in and do little refresher and there we see build thirteen</p>
      <p begin="00:50:03.080" end="00:50:05.370">...twenty fourteen and the votes are coming in</p>
      <p begin="00:50:05.370" end="00:50:10.200">and the counties are starting to let up with their preferences so they're colliding up...color</p>
      <p begin="00:50:10.200" end="00:50:17.640">for the majority vote in those counties if I go take a look at the code for this?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:17.640" end="00:50:20.800">This is that I'm in</p>
      <p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:28.050">the vote controller actually let me go to the national election service.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:28.050" end="00:50:31.160">Of yet here I am and this is actually going to.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:32.170" end="00:50:36.880">Down here getting the reliable dictionary this is the county vote count.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:36.880" end="00:50:40.880">If I click on this reliable dictionary county data you can see</p>
      <p begin="00:50:40.880" end="00:50:45.180">the here's the structure it's got its own dictionary of the shirts and it's keeping track of</p>
      <p begin="00:50:45.180" end="00:50:46.430">...per second per county.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:48.280" end="00:50:53.600">this is doing a link query across all of their reliable dictionaries for all of the</p>
      <p begin="00:50:53.600" end="00:50:58.010">counties and doing a summation on them to show us the result</p>
      <p begin="00:50:58.010" end="00:51:02.620">by shirt which is what we're...that you...and that's how easy it is all of this is</p>
      <p begin="00:51:02.620" end="00:51:09.420">du-rable consistent highly available and that's a link query across the whole thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:09.420" end="00:51:10.830">Go back here now I go to</p>
      <p begin="00:51:10.830" end="00:51:15.430">the cluster view and this is where things get interesting here's the cluster with all the microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:51:15.430" end="00:51:19.180">...with a custom ux that we built to show you.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:19.180" end="00:51:21.240">And, actually this looks like it's.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:21.240" end="00:51:27.230">Might be still deploying so here's the throughput of the votes that were saying.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:27.230" end="00:51:31.750">And, this is going to continue to rise as we get more and more these now what I've done.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:31.750" end="00:51:34.320">Is could set of placement constraint such that these microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:51:34.320" end="00:51:38.760">...can only sit on this these nodes and I'm only looking at the county</p>
      <p begin="00:51:38.760" end="00:51:40.700">...the ones where the county?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:40.700" end="00:51:42.840">Aggregators are...</p>
      <p begin="00:51:42.840" end="00:51:46.800">What I'm going to do is lift that placement constraint?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:46.800" end="00:51:54.200">And,...that placement constraint by first connecting to the service fabric endpoint.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:54.200" end="00:52:00.760">then here this you can see placement constraints on a...placement restraint...eight.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:00.760" end="00:52:07.410">And, now we're going to see this thing like spread out all over the place.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:07.410" end="00:52:16.110">You should see the start to go...here and a second.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:16.110" end="00:52:20.040">And, you can see start to see that...to migrate and in the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:20.040" end="00:52:25.080">...time...another...so we're going to see the whole all of these micros</p>
      <p begin="00:52:25.080" end="00:52:30.070">services get spread out across the rest of the cluster.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:30.070" end="00:52:34.100">Just automatically happening with the lifting that placement constraint and that remember this is</p>
      <p begin="00:52:34.100" end="00:52:38.610">stateful data that's being migrated all of those counts for this counties are being migrated as part of</p>
      <p begin="00:52:38.610" end="00:52:46.380">that these operations so that's a quick look at that let's switch back to the powerpoint.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:46.380" end="00:52:48.640">And, we have one last.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:51.600">Demo to show you and this one is a reliable</p>
      <p begin="00:52:51.600" end="00:52:55.030">...api how many people have heard of project orleans.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:56.050" end="00:53:00.120">How many people have heard of the actor model...actor...so quite a few of, you</p>
      <p begin="00:53:00.120" end="00:53:04.800">know, the reliable...api lets you build basically object-oriented microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:53:04.800" end="00:53:09.680">mrs ones where the...the state the lifecycle management is all done by the actor</p>
      <p begin="00:53:09.680" end="00:53:13.620">programming management interface you just worry about the object and the</p>

      <p begin="00:54:07.810" end="00:54:14.960">I've got actor words up here and running here's the actor I'd what I'm going to do is publish this?</p>

      <p begin="00:54:44.430" end="00:54:48.410">and that's it now let me pull this game up an effort to show you this demo...bring</p>
      <p begin="00:54:48.410" end="00:54:58.800">...sanders up and we're going to play a little afterwards.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:58.800" end="00:55:01.680">Okay, so, amazing I think this is me</p>

      <p begin="00:55:37.100" end="00:55:42.310">Actually this...working...you can imagine would be like if...</p>

      <p begin="00:56:01.440" end="00:56:07.660">And, that's by updating this game it live getting, getting I'm here, yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:07.660" end="00:56:11.070">Thanks core his...worth my dogs...my done as</p>
      <p begin="00:56:11.070" end="00:56:17.340">...can go...you everybody...course...</p>
      <p begin="00:56:17.340" end="00:56:20.600">All right so...was going to do is this is I've got a code</p>
      <p begin="00:56:20.600" end="00:56:25.640">snippy here the answer to that is going to make this the asteroids evil for...</p>
      <p begin="00:56:25.640" end="00:56:29.990">He didn't know that and then when I was going to do is I need to update the version of this?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:29.990" end="00:56:35.200">I need to set the assembly information to new version so service fabric</p>
      <p begin="00:56:35.200" end="00:56:42.570">knows it's new then I'll come up to the application and I'll say build.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:42.570" end="00:56:45.940">And, what I'm going to do is this is going to start a rolling update?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:45.940" end="00:56:50.470">So, I'm...say package.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:50.470" end="00:56:52.900">And, I'm going to go to perishable now.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:52.900" end="00:56:55.330">Nsa upload this is just</p>
      <p begin="00:56:55.330" end="00:56:58.990">...that...updated version will go back to the game.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:00.140" end="00:57:05.130">So, we're going to rolling update now that packages uploaded.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:05.130" end="00:57:08.990">And, then that started a rolling update...</p>
      <p begin="00:57:08.990" end="00:57:14.340">...to rowing update there's...rolling update and.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:14.340" end="00:57:17.970">Now what's going to happen here is these asteroids are going to sleight start to turn red and of</p>
      <p begin="00:57:17.970" end="00:57:24.800">...was up here playing set of...out like he did we would see.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:24.800" end="00:57:28.660">The asteroids are going to turn red and start to follow his ship.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:28.660" end="00:57:36.770">So, as the rolling update proceeds.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:36.770" end="00:57:37.980">...just take a few seconds.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:39.000" end="00:57:44.030">There we go and what they're going to do is they're going to follow...</p>
      <p begin="00:57:44.030" end="00:57:46.800">Thinkers backstage buying...</p>
      <p begin="00:57:46.800" end="00:57:49.010">And, you can see that there's no...of the game these</p>
      <p begin="00:57:49.010" end="00:57:53.810">...instances these actors are getting upgraded while we're playing a game</p>
      <p begin="00:57:53.810" end="00:57:57.750">in changing your logic...zero downtime as I continue to play the game</p>
      <p begin="00:57:57.750" end="00:58:04.800">all happening again through the magic and these are all...actors with multiple replicas.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:04.800" end="00:58:11.740">So, you can you get the idea that's the game.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:11.740" end="00:58:16.530">All right now one last thing that you are use...backstage aren't.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:16.530" end="00:58:18.870">So, one last thing I want to show you is</p>
      <p begin="00:58:18.870" end="00:58:23.350">...from unless I soft which has been using service fabric for a while and</p>
      <p begin="00:58:23.350" end="00:58:30.790">let's hear what they have to say about it and then I'll give you some...some other sessions and we'll wrap it up.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:30.790" end="00:58:34.830">By the way as I soft is operational intelligence company was known...resources are not</p>
      <p begin="00:58:34.830" end="00:58:37.690">...and...look at the california what we're</p>
      <p begin="00:58:37.690" end="00:58:45.050">going through right now we're going to a record drought we need to manage to resource that we have.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:45.050" end="00:58:48.030">...now is just a giant explosion in the number of</p>
      <p begin="00:58:48.030" end="00:58:51.020">sensors what we really need is a system</p>
      <p begin="00:58:51.020" end="00:58:56.620">...confide...for all this data our capturing the only way to do that...to have</p>
      <p begin="00:58:56.620" end="00:58:58.790">...in a public cloud.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:58.790" end="00:59:01.170">...set of...system services</p>

      <p begin="00:59:19.890" end="00:59:24.710">...platform concerts property reading enables us to capture the data from that</p>
      <p begin="00:59:24.710" end="00:59:29.670">proliferation sensors and do something meaningful efficient...service fabric brings</p>
      <p begin="00:59:29.670" end="00:59:34.320">...level of reliability and performance that we couldn't get by just using the</p>
      <p begin="00:59:34.320" end="00:59:39.220">standard virtual machine technologies to provide a pop for us to build new technologies within</p>
      <p begin="00:59:39.220" end="00:59:43.220">...and actually be able to bring them back on...which is important</p>
      <p begin="00:59:43.220" end="00:59:47.920">...customers for the kinds of classic problem we're trying to solve service product</p>
      <p begin="00:59:47.920" end="00:59:52.080">...is the only platform that makes sense for us to build ourselves it would've been</p>
      <p begin="00:59:52.080" end="00:59:55.750">...actual undertaking for us we want to concentration where we</p>
      <p begin="00:59:55.750" end="00:59:59.910">...leverage the platform?</p>
      <p begin="00:59:59.910" end="01:00:03.710">Right so let's...back and I'll give you some a little bit of a</p>
      <p begin="01:00:03.710" end="01:00:08.260">roadmap into what you're getting today with service fabric and then point</p>
      <p begin="01:00:08.260" end="01:00:11.200">...some other video so today languages are</p>
      <p begin="01:00:11.200" end="01:00:16.150">cplus-plus and csharp we've got other languages coming operating systems today is windows linux is</p>
      <p begin="01:00:16.150" end="01:00:20.770">...be coming containers right now is job objects on windows you'll see containers on windows</p>
      <p begin="01:00:20.770" end="01:00:22.990">linux and finally integration with...today</p>
      <p begin="01:00:22.990" end="01:00:28.280">...an sdk there's the url the sdk which is live now and future will have research</p>
      <p begin="01:00:28.280" end="01:00:32.470">providers...service fabric that will may cluster management simpler.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:32.470" end="01:00:34.010">And, then that basically takes me</p>
      <p begin="01:00:34.010" end="01:00:38.590">...through the whole stack of course you want to get higher-level we saw web apps this morning</p>
      <p begin="01:00:38.590" end="01:00:41.940">and app service as the higher-level programming</p>
      <p begin="01:00:41.940" end="01:00:45.440">model on top of measure compute platform that flushes it out from</p>
      <p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:50.430">high control to high productivity and then finally</p>
      <p begin="01:00:50.430" end="01:00:55.010">...other sessions that we've got...go deeper into service fabric in the containers and</p>
      <p begin="01:00:55.010" end="01:00:59.940">to resource manager into the new vtwo versions of these api is without I want to thank you very much I</p>
      <p begin="01:00:59.940" end="01:01:04.210">hope you have a great conference and how plan on answer and with service?</p>
