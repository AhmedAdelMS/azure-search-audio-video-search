      <p begin="00:00:44.580" end="00:00:49.130">when you take a look at the amount of money that we pay you developers</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.130" end="00:00:53.960">and the windows ecosystem and this is a metric that you've seen in the analytics session that we've had and that</p>
      <p begin="00:00:53.960" end="00:00:57.430">center session that we had yesterday a third of that money</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.430" end="00:01:02.090">comes from advertising so that's a hefty chunk so regardless of if</p>
      <p begin="00:01:02.090" end="00:01:06.640">you're using add monetize a shun as your primary source of my making or if</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.640" end="00:01:11.420">you're leveraging other options like ip or giving a price for your app this</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.420" end="00:01:15.200">session is very important for you because we've done some great work and great improvements</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.200" end="00:01:19.410">in microsoft advertising to increase your monetize a shun let's take a look at how</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.410" end="00:01:24.710">microsoft advertising has been faring and I'm going to use data from the past six months to show you</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.710" end="00:01:29.150">year over year revenue for microsoft advertising now the important</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.150" end="00:01:35.180">thing to notices the orange bars are almost twice as big as a great</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.180" end="00:01:35.510">Yes,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.510" end="00:01:40.590">we have one month that is not quite twice but still hire and this is indicative of the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:45.580">momentum because you asked us to make more money with microsoft advertising and in fact</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.580" end="00:01:50.270">you are we're very excited about this momentum is indicative of the high...rates</p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.270" end="00:01:55.400">and the high cp m that we can provide here at microsoft and we're hoping to continue this momentum</p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.400" end="00:01:57.690">and twenty fifteen and beyond.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.690" end="00:01:59.640">So, let's...a quick overview of the agenda for</p>
      <p begin="00:01:59.640" end="00:02:04.590">this session first we're going to talk about app promotion successful developers</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.590" end="00:02:09.140">acquire users without promotion either cross-promotions which we refer to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.140" end="00:02:12.770">as house ads those are ads that show up within your own apps or</p>
      <p begin="00:02:12.770" end="00:02:15.750">page promotions those are ads for your app that show up</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.750" end="00:02:21.380">and other apps in the ecosystem so vj is going to talk about the great work that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:21.380" end="00:02:25.300">has team is done in the app promotion space then we're going to move on</p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.300" end="00:02:28.450">to the windows ten advertising sdk</p>
      <p begin="00:02:28.450" end="00:02:33.170">...energy see twenty fifteen this year and february and I focused on the monetize</p>
      <p begin="00:02:33.170" end="00:02:38.070">...track and analysis after analysis after analysis was showing that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.070" end="00:02:42.440">even though game developers are making ninety percent of all the revenue from ip</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.440" end="00:02:46.520">adding advertising side-by-side with ip doesn't impact your</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.520" end="00:02:52.170">buyers and gives you more money so video interstitial is one of</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.170" end="00:02:55.880">a very specific intuitive and lucrative way of making more</p>
      <p begin="00:02:55.880" end="00:03:00.870">ad money in your game and we've announcer a few times in the past couple days</p>
      <p begin="00:03:00.870" end="00:03:05.570">...announcing it again video interstitial is coming to microsoft advertising and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.570" end="00:03:09.920">...is going to talk about that an additional work that we've done in the sdk space for windows</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.920" end="00:03:15.340">stand and then finally ad mediation so back in november we released windows</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.340" end="00:03:20.300">at mediation for windows phone only some of you may have used it and what we call</p>
      <p begin="00:03:20.300" end="00:03:23.830">the legacy portal and windows phone so that's</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23.830" end="00:03:28.700">another thing that we notice successful developers do the fact is that no matter how good an</p>
      <p begin="00:03:28.700" end="00:03:33.820">...provider is they cannot guarantee hundred-percent celebrate so if you want to maximize your</p>
      <p begin="00:03:33.820" end="00:03:36.950">fill rate and have the ability to favor your high cp</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.950" end="00:03:41.880">and providers ad mediation is the solution for you and we've done some great work with windows</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.880" end="00:03:44.710">ad mediation to make aggregation available for all of</p>

      <p begin="00:13:16.710" end="00:13:20.220">As you see heavy provide a few tools for you to construct your at</p>
      <p begin="00:13:20.220" end="00:13:24.050">...these creative elements come from what</p>
      <p begin="00:13:24.050" end="00:13:26.960">...submitted to the windows dead-center so for instance a logo</p>
      <p begin="00:13:26.960" end="00:13:31.690">of your app is here you can said the background design of your at creative this</p>
      <p begin="00:13:31.690" end="00:13:37.030">is how this ad will show up in other apps since is app is free you can</p>
      <p begin="00:13:37.030" end="00:13:41.920">selected three this app is brand-new I don't have any rating I don't want this to be a</p>
      <p begin="00:13:41.920" end="00:13:46.170">turnoff for users to download so I'm going to remove the app rating from</p>

      <p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:14:01.680">Best movie app as you notice here we've also enable editorial...so that</p>
      <p begin="00:14:01.680" end="00:14:06.530">...app meets the editorial body network so for instance if I put cool movie</p>
      <p begin="00:14:06.530" end="00:14:11.240">sexy app it'll automatically figure out that I am</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.240" end="00:14:16.200">I'm violating the editorial policies so this is not allowed in this so you can be</p>
      <p begin="00:14:16.200" end="00:14:23.990">...that one legal valid editorial...content will be allowed here.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:23.990" end="00:14:30.970">All right so this let's libby...play around with the design this looks decent for me.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:30.970" end="00:14:35.130">Let's let me move on to the targeting section desired design looks good again,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:35.130" end="00:14:39.940">I'm going to opting to this auto targeting because microsoft really understands the user base</p>

      <p begin="00:14:49.240" end="00:14:52.900">targeted country here in this particular case.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:52.900" end="00:14:59.920">...go ahead and set of monthly budget let's say four hundred-dollars.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:59.920" end="00:15:04.690">Since I've already used a few credit cards within microsoft services for</p>
      <p begin="00:15:04.690" end="00:15:09.220">such as you or commerce and other places my credit cards automatically show up</p>
      <p begin="00:15:09.220" end="00:15:13.690">here so here I've used to credit cards I can pick one of them for this campaign</p>
      <p begin="00:15:13.690" end="00:15:18.360">how if you decide to use a new credit card you can add so right here.</p>

      <p begin="00:16:09.390" end="00:16:15.790">tracking this is a first part install tracking so as you notice here you can measure your</p>
      <p begin="00:16:15.790" end="00:16:20.920">...using various metrics for instance how many impressions how many</p>
      <p begin="00:16:20.920" end="00:16:24.890">if your brand goal if your goal is primarily to create</p>

      <p begin="00:16:29.880" end="00:16:32.310">your...so far how many times users of</p>
      <p begin="00:16:32.310" end="00:16:37.140">senior app you can look at the correlation between the number of impression served in the click to rate</p>
      <p begin="00:16:37.140" end="00:16:41.170">of that the effectiveness of cdr is a important number to measure the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:41.170" end="00:16:44.900">...effectiveness finally you can track how many installs it</p>
      <p begin="00:16:44.900" end="00:16:50.590">led to this is essentially the first party tracking you can obviously select as many as for</p>

      <p begin="00:19:49.720" end="00:19:54.500">released...those of you...been using the microsoft advertising as again the past every time we released</p>
      <p begin="00:19:54.500" end="00:19:58.480">and you version if you wanted to enjoy the goodness that comes without version</p>
      <p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:03.330">you needed to integrated into your app which resulted in an app update app updates are costly</p>
      <p begin="00:20:03.330" end="00:20:07.830">for-you their painful for users so again very excited to announce that the windows ten</p>
      <p begin="00:20:07.830" end="00:20:13.200">...sdk will be shipped as an os framework which means that we can...goodness without you</p>
      <p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:18.350">need to make any go changes and you just get it for free when the store updates so that's</p>
      <p begin="00:20:18.350" end="00:20:23.570">another good thing and then finally you asked for more ad experiences and we've</p>
      <p begin="00:20:23.570" end="00:20:27.300">announce it several times and I'm going to do it yet again video interstitial</p>
      <p begin="00:20:27.300" end="00:20:32.060">as which is a big deal is coming to microsoft advertising and I'm very excited to invite</p>
      <p begin="00:20:32.060" end="00:20:35.720">...to the stage to talk about the windows sent ad sdk and also</p>
      <p begin="00:20:35.720" end="00:20:43.060">why video interstitial is something that you want to start working with right now thanks-a-lot near.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:43.060" end="00:20:48.110">I'm happy to announce for the fourth time that we have video interstitial ads</p>
      <p begin="00:20:48.110" end="00:20:52.470">and there's really three reasons why you would want to use video interstitial ads</p>
      <p begin="00:20:52.470" end="00:20:56.420">number-one the money right number two</p>
      <p begin="00:20:56.420" end="00:21:01.540">it's a better fit for a lot of games a number three is super easy to do so I want to touch</p>
      <p begin="00:21:01.540" end="00:21:06.360">on each of those three points in terms of money is actually a product that</p>
      <p begin="00:21:06.360" end="00:21:10.530">the yields accordingly marketer ten-x what the banner ads</p>
      <p begin="00:21:10.530" end="00:21:14.520">too now before you start getting all the greedy</p>
      <p begin="00:21:14.520" end="00:21:18.980">so to speak you have to bear in mind that banner ads</p>
      <p begin="00:21:18.980" end="00:21:22.460">you rotating every sixty seconds and you're not going to do that probably</p>
      <p begin="00:21:22.460" end="00:21:26.100">with video ads but you still will have a higher overall revenue</p>
      <p begin="00:21:26.100" end="00:21:30.870">you can you can count on that the second thing it touch on is</p>
      <p begin="00:21:30.870" end="00:21:34.670">...is a better fit especially for games right you guys have all</p>
      <p begin="00:21:34.670" end="00:21:39.780">seen this before we have we have a game which kind of share both the</p>
      <p begin="00:21:39.780" end="00:21:43.750">...in the game play on the same screen user accidently clicks the add</p>
      <p begin="00:21:43.750" end="00:21:48.730">...a cuts a constant problem so for user experience reasons as well as</p>
      <p begin="00:21:48.730" end="00:21:53.730">performance if your direct decks game you're trying to show html on the scene screen the same time</p>
      <p begin="00:21:53.730" end="00:21:58.260">as direct acts as a much better thing to be able to sort of swap out the screens.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:58.260" end="00:22:03.830">So, for both user experience and for performance reasons it's a good fit and lastly it's</p>
      <p begin="00:22:03.830" end="00:22:08.050">easy to integrate and how easy to integrate I hear you cry so,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:08.050" end="00:22:10.700">easy a program manager can do it so let</p>
      <p begin="00:22:10.700" end="00:22:14.250">me with that show you my game so I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:22:14.250" end="00:22:22.410">to go switch gears here and head right into visual studio?</p>
      <p begin="00:22:22.410" end="00:22:22.910">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:24.120" end="00:22:26.130">So, the first thing that I wanted to point</p>
      <p begin="00:22:26.130" end="00:22:29.740">out maybe even use the pointer thank you.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:30.860" end="00:22:36.260">The first thing that I wanted to point out is that there's no longer such thing up and there</p>
      <p begin="00:22:36.260" end="00:22:40.760">is a any cpu since we're native library you are going to have to switch to</p>
      <p begin="00:22:40.760" end="00:22:45.700">architecture specific outputs so in this case I'm using x eighty-six</p>
      <p begin="00:22:45.700" end="00:22:49.290">is my output the second thing that I wanted to point out of highlighted</p>
      <p begin="00:22:49.290" end="00:22:54.270">already is that it is the very same name space as the banner ads if</p>
      <p begin="00:22:54.270" end="00:22:59.380">you're using the banner ads so that also means is coming from the same sdk so</p>
      <p begin="00:22:59.380" end="00:23:04.050">you don't have to go download something different it's...be...the same sdk.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:04.050" end="00:23:07.870">And, I'll show you what the heart and soul.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:07.870" end="00:23:12.870">...api...which is really for events actually I kind of glossed over you have to obviously</p>
      <p begin="00:23:12.870" end="00:23:17.670">instantiate control...it but...therefore events in those for of</p>
      <p begin="00:23:17.670" end="00:23:22.930">answers follows the ad ready event is fired ...the point in time</p>
      <p begin="00:23:22.930" end="00:23:27.420">at between requesting...and you're going to show it so unlike banner as we</p>
      <p begin="00:23:27.420" end="00:23:31.830">...to have a synchronous go fetch and show it all-in-one transaction through the refresh</p>
      <p begin="00:23:31.830" end="00:23:37.540">call with video interstitial...you want to prefix those ads and you're doing that because you don't want</p>
      <p begin="00:23:37.540" end="00:23:40.800">to leave the user hanging while we're gone and fetching a video which is a much</p>
      <p begin="00:23:40.800" end="00:23:45.610">...substantially larger asset than...banner ads.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:45.610" end="00:23:49.070">So, the next two things that you see up I have something on top sorry</p>
      <p begin="00:23:49.070" end="00:23:54.280">cancelled and completed those two can fire off during the playback of the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:54.280" end="00:23:57.690">ads of the user decides to bail-out of the...early you get a</p>
      <p begin="00:23:57.690" end="00:24:01.430">...event if the user goes and watches the adult way through the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:01.430" end="00:24:06.240">n which is what we want you'll get the completed events and why do we want the user watch the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:06.240" end="00:24:09.850">whole thing well we're going to get a lot better revenue if we have</p>
      <p begin="00:24:09.850" end="00:24:15.220">high completion right so we encourage that and lastly there's the error occurred event the error</p>
      <p begin="00:24:15.220" end="00:24:18.830">...event is exactly the same as...banner ads and just so,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:18.830" end="00:24:22.960">you know, very rarely would you ever see those come during ad playback</p>
      <p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:26.210">...most frequently going to happen during the ad fetch?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:26.210" end="00:24:30.610">So, without in like it's kind of glossed over another colleges request ads you quest</p>
      <p begin="00:24:30.610" end="00:24:35.410">add-in show at those the final two things I happen to wrap them into my own method because I'm calling various</p>
      <p begin="00:24:35.410" end="00:24:40.040">ad units to for the sake of this demo but, you would otherwise just call</p>
      <p begin="00:24:40.040" end="00:24:43.890">...ad dot requests...very simple.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:43.890" end="00:24:51.100">So, with that let me go ahead and run my program manager game.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:51.100" end="00:24:59.060">It is the best game ever I hope you enjoy it okay it's a throwback.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:59.060" end="00:25:02.060">So, let me say this is maybe the first and only time you're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:25:02.060" end="00:25:08.100">see microsoft guy up on a stage happy to see a blue screen so thank you very much.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:08.100" end="00:25:11.270">And, the second thing that I wanted to point out the reason I</p>
      <p begin="00:25:11.270" end="00:25:16.150">picked it old-school primitive game-like this is...two reasons one it's easy to program</p>
      <p begin="00:25:16.150" end="00:25:20.980">honestly but secondly it also has to show that really doesn't matter what that games genre is we could put</p>
      <p begin="00:25:20.980" end="00:25:26.260">video ads and anything so without further ado I'm going-to go ahead and accept</p>
      <p begin="00:25:26.260" end="00:25:31.030">the value proposition that's been offered to me here the to start level two I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:25:31.030" end="00:25:41.190">watcher video okay that's cool I got a for free tomorrow with this.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:41.190" end="00:25:45.230">The as you're okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:48.360">There for two reasons.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:48.360" end="00:25:52.120">One it makes my game looked that much more primitive the to of</p>
      <p begin="00:25:52.120" end="00:25:54.870">...a thousand times but anyway it's a gorgeous that so</p>
      <p begin="00:25:54.870" end="00:25:57.590">you see what happens now is that I've said.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:57.590" end="00:26:00.020">You gotta watch the whole thing so obviously I wired up that</p>
      <p begin="00:26:00.020" end="00:26:04.270">...event that I showed you before to basically encourage user you going to go watch the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:04.270" end="00:26:10.120">whole thing so all right and game again I got...for free some happy I watch</p>
      <p begin="00:26:10.120" end="00:26:15.200">the whole thing spoiler alert this is actually a home video and I enlisting the help of my</p>
      <p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:25.980">family to show this...</p>
      <p begin="00:26:25.980" end="00:26:30.380">What staff why some of the advertising disclosure that tells and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:30.380" end="00:26:39.060">app is advertisement not regular content?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:40.260" end="00:26:42.700">The number that's the countdown on the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:42.700" end="00:26:47.560">...time tells you how much time's left in the admass me.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:47.560" end="00:26:52.390">Was a little more than three this happens to be a very long at the most at the...fifteen</p>
      <p begin="00:26:52.390" end="00:26:58.610">...seconds reasons...very expensive to make video as</p>
      <p begin="00:27:08.150" end="00:27:11.210">...a...backbone because I haven't clinton's</p>
      <p begin="00:27:11.210" end="00:27:13.240">...yet pshaw moi.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:19.430" end="00:27:26.520">...going to learn more about okay, wait...can't...at...</p>
      <p begin="00:27:26.520" end="00:27:29.940">umass euclid...more moi.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:32.890" end="00:27:35.960">...button will appear in...that actually have</p>
      <p begin="00:27:35.960" end="00:27:38.890">...in this case you'll notice that we now</p>
      <p begin="00:27:38.890" end="00:27:42.290">...slit...in windows phone...actually get</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42.290" end="00:27:49.110">...rather but you're always just one back but...</p>
      <p begin="00:27:57.510" end="00:28:06.130">Cheap laborI did give a cookie for the record okay moi.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:06.130" end="00:28:10.110">All right so I know you're thinking gee map that's nice you can put a fake at in the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:10.110" end="00:28:13.660">fake game how about a real...real game and I know they got a</p>
      <p begin="00:28:13.660" end="00:28:17.850">...before I'm not even sure if the here is...random sell guys here?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:17.850" end="00:28:21.640">I guess not ok well random salad was the first to put</p>
      <p begin="00:28:21.640" end="00:28:26.110">our video interstitial out liveso, I have little video clip to show you</p>
      <p begin="00:28:26.110" end="00:28:34.760">...again, that they created running on a...in live today.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:34.760" end="00:28:36.950">And, I kept silent so I could</p>
      <p begin="00:28:36.950" end="00:28:41.500">...on top of the video and what you'll notice that they did is that they basically did</p>
      <p begin="00:28:41.500" end="00:28:45.650">appear interstitial so the very end of this level I'm not particularly great at this game you'll</p>
      <p begin="00:28:45.650" end="00:28:51.220">see that automatically we come up with an ad...interrupt the user was all done plane that level</p>
      <p begin="00:28:51.220" end="00:28:55.740">of comes the add this at doesn't have a learn more link because it doesn't have a clicked web action they don't</p>
      <p begin="00:28:55.740" end="00:28:59.640">...have that but otherwise looks the same as the windows one and you can activate</p>
      <p begin="00:28:59.640" end="00:29:06.120">the back button exactly same thing so that is our first app out in the...using video</p>
      <p begin="00:29:06.120" end="00:29:15.010">...through a close pilot congratulations...random valid?</p>
      <p begin="00:29:15.010" end="00:29:20.000">next step is what is going to go over some of the best practices I alluded to some of them when I was</p>
      <p begin="00:29:20.000" end="00:29:23.290">shown you the demo but this is more or less a laundry list of</p>
      <p begin="00:29:23.290" end="00:29:27.820">come to affectionately show note a should know these next slide is the nags</p>
      <p begin="00:29:27.820" end="00:29:32.780">...which is kind of do this don't do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:32.780" end="00:29:37.670">So, if you bear with me so the best practices is it really got</p>
      <p begin="00:29:37.670" end="00:29:42.390">to think about these ads during the design...don't think you're going to just design the game and kinda come in the and</p>
      <p begin="00:29:42.390" end="00:29:47.060">slap in slap in the ads you can get away with that with the banner ads with interstitial ads with the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:47.060" end="00:29:51.190">prevention all of those events that your wiring really figure out where in the workflow</p>
      <p begin="00:29:51.190" end="00:29:56.440">...sense and you...really show it right roger...is doing a demo in the theater</p>
      <p begin="00:29:56.440" end="00:30:00.420">later today at two thirty I believe you can go see a real like direct</p>
      <p begin="00:30:00.420" end="00:30:06.410">x game and he's written cplus-plus it's really cool demos were seen so,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:06.410" end="00:30:12.290">natural breaks it's kind of self-explanatory...my brakes were if it's</p>
      <p begin="00:30:12.290" end="00:30:14.850">Sports title he might have a between innings</p>
      <p begin="00:30:14.850" end="00:30:19.210">...your game you'll know where to put those ads.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:19.210" end="00:30:21.640">Associate with tangible...is basically</p>
      <p begin="00:30:23.200" end="00:30:27.470">...the user is getting value out of the ads so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:27.470" end="00:30:32.120">you might have a hint if it's a puzzle game is a puzzle game you may...I can go</p>
      <p begin="00:30:32.120" end="00:30:37.200">...the game or might be an extra life or might be more time to finish</p>
      <p begin="00:30:37.200" end="00:30:41.410">...level those are those are examples of good tangible...to give the user and</p>
      <p begin="00:30:41.410" end="00:30:45.010">...you want to continually improve don't think that you're just going to like</p>
      <p begin="00:30:45.010" end="00:30:49.440">releases in let it go you really want to look at our reports and make sure that your</p>
      <p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:54.170">ads are performing well and, you know,...</p>
      <p begin="00:30:54.170" end="00:30:59.640">remake changes you need to in re submit then let's...the worst practices so</p>
      <p begin="00:30:59.640" end="00:31:03.530">...you guys have probably seen some of these so some examples so showing ads</p>
      <p begin="00:31:03.530" end="00:31:08.350">apps start it seems like that would be a great placement because well I'm going to get a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:31:08.350" end="00:31:13.230">money from it seemingly...a short-term strategy because the first few users who just click a</p>
      <p begin="00:31:13.230" end="00:31:17.120">...going to be confuse they're going to think they launched the media app or something and they are</p>
      <p begin="00:31:17.120" end="00:31:22.080">paragon rate your app pretty poorly so I would avoid that interrupting users imagine I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:25.760">clicking all those bubbles and lo and behold something that</p>
      <p begin="00:31:25.760" end="00:31:30.250">comes up out of nowhere that's not a very good placement don't do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:30.250" end="00:31:35.110">Back-to-back ad so just imagine I was getting ready to play level to</p>
      <p begin="00:31:35.110" end="00:31:40.250">...excited I'm watching the...go down it's zero lo and behold it pops up another added</p>
      <p begin="00:31:40.250" end="00:31:44.000">...fifteen or thirty seconds that's you can do at the api...will allow</p>
      <p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:48.280">it but that's definitely going to have some user backlash you...avoid</p>
      <p begin="00:31:48.280" end="00:31:53.770">and leslie's rewarding with exchangeable currency so if you're actually giving out real money or even anything that's</p>
      <p begin="00:31:53.770" end="00:31:57.910">that can be traded with other users in your app ecosystem do you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:31:57.910" end="00:32:02.140">avoid that because you really opening ourselves up to hackers and hackers tend to win.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:02.140" end="00:32:06.970">And, you have to keep up with them right.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:06.970" end="00:32:11.810">These are just the sample so when you go in and get our bits and get the documentation make sure</p>
      <p begin="00:32:11.810" end="00:32:16.750">you read all the best practices I was just giving you sort...sampling for the sake of time.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:16.750" end="00:32:22.760">want to sum it up what you just saw a few other goodies so.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:22.760" end="00:32:27.460">The best practices can be summed up in a single sentence make a good game the money's going</p>
      <p begin="00:32:27.460" end="00:32:32.000">to follow trust me and then secondly let's talk about the availability</p>
      <p begin="00:32:32.000" end="00:32:36.920">of already told you...and pilot today it's in a close pilot we're out there eight-hour one</p>
      <p begin="00:32:36.920" end="00:32:40.690">...both phone and on windows and windows ten you can go download the</p>
      <p begin="00:32:40.690" end="00:32:44.950">bit's now and they work with the very same visual studio twenty fifteen and,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:44.950" end="00:32:50.340">the os is was just ship for this conference in fact that's what I'm running now and will be</p>
      <p begin="00:32:50.340" end="00:32:54.320">release ready in association with the windows ten launch timeframe?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:33:00.700">Other benefits near already talked about it...recap it were native that means we don't...the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:00.700" end="00:33:05.630">net framework...is a framework that means we don't have to be distributed the library if we</p>

      <p begin="00:34:28.270" end="00:34:33.170">And, by the way this last year probably one of the things I've felt most bad about</p>
      <p begin="00:34:33.170" end="00:34:36.400">...that we didn't deliver on time to have ww a or</p>

      <p begin="00:35:00.500" end="00:35:02.210">Cute kid.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:02.210" end="00:35:04.130">Let's see if I could follow that up with some windows</p>
      <p begin="00:35:04.130" end="00:35:08.390">at mediation free to get excited about so we talked about</p>
      <p begin="00:35:08.390" end="00:35:12.250">our promotions we talked about the new sdk let's talk about</p>
      <p begin="00:35:12.250" end="00:35:12.780">ad mediation.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:13.900" end="00:35:18.770">As I said before ad mediation is something that successful developers do in order to maximize their</p>
      <p begin="00:35:18.770" end="00:35:20.640">fill rates and...their high</p>
      <p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:25.620">...and providers however mediation is very complicated and costly</p>
      <p begin="00:35:25.620" end="00:35:30.590">you need to find the right assemblies you need to read multiple documentations you need to implement</p>
      <p begin="00:35:30.590" end="00:35:36.110">multiple codes for different providers and that's before even start with your mediation configuration and even then</p>
      <p begin="00:35:36.110" end="00:35:40.930">one mediation configuration is likely not going to work free very well if you're app is successful</p>
      <p begin="00:35:40.930" end="00:35:45.210">...more than one market because different ad providers are performing differently</p>
      <p begin="00:35:45.210" end="00:35:48.760">in different geography's so like I said back in november of</p>
      <p begin="00:35:48.760" end="00:35:53.650">twenty fourteen were released windows ad mediation for phone and we're very excited to say that as soon as</p>
      <p begin="00:35:53.650" end="00:35:56.980">...center exits preview and you can start submitting apps</p>
      <p begin="00:35:56.980" end="00:36:00.540">in-depth center you will be able to take advantage of windows</p>
      <p begin="00:36:00.540" end="00:36:03.820">...mediation for all your apps and it addresses all these</p>
      <p begin="00:36:03.820" end="00:36:08.560">...points another one that I wanted to call out separately is that if you do implement</p>
      <p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:13.530">your own mediation every time you make changes that mediation configuration and you</p>
      <p begin="00:36:13.530" end="00:36:18.530">will have to make multiple changes to that because it's a dynamic configuration between different</p>
      <p begin="00:36:18.530" end="00:36:23.300">providers...it results in a code change that requires you to build your app and send</p>
      <p begin="00:36:23.300" end="00:36:28.160">...update which as we said before is costly for you and it's painful for users</p>
      <p begin="00:36:28.160" end="00:36:33.140">if you set up jan service to do that it is also extremely expensive and windows...mediation does that</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.140" end="00:36:37.200">for-you you-can go-to deb center and you can create configurations</p>
      <p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:39.820">...specific markets and change them as many times</p>
      <p begin="00:36:39.820" end="00:36:44.980">as you want and they will be consumed by applications that without</p>
      <p begin="00:36:44.980" end="00:36:51.060">needed without the need of an app update and then finally we touched on that before is do I really</p>
      <p begin="00:36:51.060" end="00:36:55.510">need to go to...center in order to monetize with adds the app that I've submitted</p>
      <p begin="00:36:55.510" end="00:37:00.520">...dead-center well the answer is no again very excited to have created</p>
      <p begin="00:37:01.960" end="00:37:05.500">red carpet white glove more expletives for?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:06.660" end="00:37:10.650">To make it easy for you to use microsoft advertising for your</p>
      <p begin="00:37:10.650" end="00:37:12.650">ad monetize a shun and with</p>
      <p begin="00:37:12.650" end="00:37:28.480">that let's go ahead and jump to a demo to show you exactly how that looks.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:28.480" end="00:37:34.040">All right so I went ahead and created this windows application in visual studio twenty</p>
      <p begin="00:37:34.040" end="00:37:38.890">fifteen and the first thing that I'm going to do is you'll know that here the tool-box I have an</p>
      <p begin="00:37:38.890" end="00:37:43.840">ad mediator control that would be the new ad control so I'm going-to go ahead I'm going to drag</p>
      <p begin="00:37:43.840" end="00:37:47.940">at controls to the designer to the...I want to show ads</p>
      <p begin="00:37:47.940" end="00:37:52.590">so I'm going to put one at the top left and one of the bottom right now I'm going to give</p>
      <p begin="00:37:52.590" end="00:37:57.520">them meaningful names the reason I'm going to do that is when I upload this package</p>
      <p begin="00:37:57.520" end="00:38:02.490">...center I will need to configure the metadata for the participating ad networks so it helps that</p>
      <p begin="00:38:02.490" end="00:38:08.150">the control is identifiable for-you in-depth center some going to call this one top</p>
      <p begin="00:38:08.150" end="00:38:14.290">And, I'm going to call this one bottom...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:14.290" end="00:38:19.000">Now I talked about red carpets and white gloves whether I mean for those of you</p>
      <p begin="00:38:19.000" end="00:38:23.360">of monetize without center in the past, you know, that you needed to create account...center</p>
      <p begin="00:38:23.360" end="00:38:27.360">...payout api create attacks profile generate app ideas and add unit</p>
      <p begin="00:38:27.360" end="00:38:32.250">...copy pace them into your code that you've implemented specifically for microsoft advertising before</p>
      <p begin="00:38:32.250" end="00:38:37.990">you could build and upload...center by dragging the control from the toolbox</p>
      <p begin="00:38:37.990" end="00:38:41.850">...the designer we've implemented everything for you if you want to monetize</p>
      <p begin="00:38:41.850" end="00:38:46.810">...microsoft advertising your done once you've drive those controls you can build your app and</p>
      <p begin="00:38:46.810" end="00:38:51.220">you can submit to dead-center however before we do that we also</p>
      <p begin="00:38:51.220" end="00:38:56.060">mention that successful developers use ad mediation in order to maximize fill rates and favor high</p>
      <p begin="00:38:56.060" end="00:38:59.780">cp and providers so I highly recommend you take advantage of the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:59.780" end="00:39:03.440">ad mediation feature that is built into this at control in order</p>
      <p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:09.700">to do that from the project menu you can go ahead and add and you connected service.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:09.700" end="00:39:14.060">And, you'll know that ad mediator is one of those connect services available for-you</p>
      <p begin="00:39:14.060" end="00:39:19.030">so the first thing you'll see is...microsoft advertising by default is already part of our</p>
      <p begin="00:39:19.030" end="00:39:24.180">project and we knew that let's go ahead and select additional ad networks I'm going to choose...duplex</p>
      <p begin="00:39:24.180" end="00:39:25.790">...in this case.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:25.790" end="00:39:27.760">Now is like okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.760" end="00:39:32.740">Tvs goes to know get to grab the right assemblies for this project type from ad duplex</p>
      <p begin="00:39:32.740" end="00:39:37.290">since model we've worked with those companies to go ahead and get their assemblies</p>
      <p begin="00:39:37.290" end="00:39:41.780">tuner get and for us to make the decision on which assemblies to grabs so</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.780" end="00:39:45.160">you no longer need to find those you no longer need to deal with</p>
      <p begin="00:39:45.160" end="00:39:48.260">adding the references once I had okay I can see the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:48.260" end="00:39:52.570">three participating and networks now before we exit connected services I do want to call</p>
      <p begin="00:39:52.570" end="00:39:56.810">out the configure option that is available for each one of the providers so let's highlight</p>
      <p begin="00:39:56.810" end="00:40:02.220">...duplex and hit configure this is an optional step where you can enter the metadata the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:02.220" end="00:40:07.220">you've retrieved from the ad duplex portal the reason you would use it here is if you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:07.220" end="00:40:09.340">silo your app or if you want to ts</p>
      <p begin="00:40:09.340" end="00:40:13.450">...local machine in the case of a windows app and you want to test that metadata you</p>
      <p begin="00:40:13.450" end="00:40:17.900">retrieve chose live ads you would use it here this is an optional step so</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.900" end="00:40:23.090">I'm not going to do that and we're just going-to go ahead and add and of course the background</p>
      <p begin="00:40:23.090" end="00:40:28.040">goes away which is easily fixable by loading main page again.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:28.040" end="00:40:31.850">And, we're ready to go all we need to do now is build our app and uploaded into</p>
      <p begin="00:40:31.850" end="00:40:34.390">...now before we moved to dead-center</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.390" end="00:40:39.250">in see the experience there I do want to call out that we've implemented a bunch of events on these</p>
      <p begin="00:40:39.250" end="00:40:42.120">...controls that you can register to encode and either</p>
      <p begin="00:40:42.120" end="00:40:46.560">...consul or to your own logs for testing purposes we have extensive</p>
      <p begin="00:40:46.560" end="00:40:51.600">documentation on all the event registration and practices that we recommend you</p>
      <p begin="00:40:51.600" end="00:40:57.330">...visual studio so let's go ahead and move to dead-center now</p>
      <p begin="00:40:57.330" end="00:41:03.150">I already created ...app and the preview that center called ...twenty fifteen for the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03.150" end="00:41:06.040">one and I've created a submission and</p>
      <p begin="00:41:06.040" end="00:41:10.620">for demo purposes I already went ahead and uploaded and identical package to the one which is</p>
      <p begin="00:41:10.620" end="00:41:14.970">created visual studio the first thing that you'll node is that there's a configure</p>
      <p begin="00:41:14.970" end="00:41:18.780">ad mediation link in the details section for that package</p>
      <p begin="00:41:18.780" end="00:41:22.080">that's go ahead and click that it's going to take us to the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:22.080" end="00:41:25.810">...page for that app which is also available from the left</p>
      <p begin="00:41:25.810" end="00:41:29.910">...menu under the monetize a shun parent in the context of that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:29.910" end="00:41:34.370">up so let's take a look at the...well the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to choose the package that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:34.370" end="00:41:37.960">...configuring since there are multiple...providers</p>
      <p begin="00:41:37.960" end="00:41:42.140">...that work from multiple app types we're going to configure on a</p>
      <p begin="00:41:42.140" end="00:41:45.720">package by package basis so let's go ahead and continue</p>
      <p begin="00:41:45.720" end="00:41:49.460">configuring the package you that we just uploaded</p>
      <p begin="00:41:49.460" end="00:41:53.770">right next is the target baseline here is to distinguish from a</p>
      <p begin="00:41:53.770" end="00:41:57.160">market specific configuration if you don't create a market specific</p>
      <p begin="00:41:57.160" end="00:42:01.950">configuration baseline is going to be used everywhere and I'm going to show you a little bit later how to create a</p>
      <p begin="00:42:01.950" end="00:42:06.930">market specific configuration where it makes sense then you can enter your global refresh rate that's</p>
      <p begin="00:42:06.930" end="00:42:10.920">going to work across all the participating providers and now where</p>
      <p begin="00:42:10.920" end="00:42:16.310">the mediation configuration new so let's go ahead and take a look at that so the first thing that you will</p>
      <p begin="00:42:16.310" end="00:42:21.220">note is that microsoft advertising is by default getting a hundred-percent of the distribution</p>
      <p begin="00:42:21.220" end="00:42:25.490">and also that we added a logical provider for microsoft advertising</p>
      <p begin="00:42:25.490" end="00:42:30.010">house ads that is at by default...to backup vj talked about</p>
      <p begin="00:42:30.010" end="00:42:34.470">...promotions and cross-promotions with has campaigns if you create has campaigns</p>
      <p begin="00:42:34.470" end="00:42:38.070">you can then configure them and mediate them with other ad providers that are</p>
      <p begin="00:42:38.070" end="00:42:43.420">participating in your package so we're going to get to that shortly next...also notice that ad</p>
      <p begin="00:42:43.420" end="00:42:47.870">duplex since model are both set to an active by default.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:47.870" end="00:42:50.190">Now the reason for that is there's</p>
      <p begin="00:42:50.190" end="00:42:54.880">actually required metadata for both these providers that you need to enter</p>
      <p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:42:56.830">...center before we can start showing</p>
      <p begin="00:42:56.830" end="00:43:02.380">...those providers that's metadata that you've retrieved from their portals so in this case I</p>
      <p begin="00:43:02.380" end="00:43:06.500">went ahead and entered it I will call out the one we talked about connected services</p>
      <p begin="00:43:06.500" end="00:43:11.980">and visual studio if you remember that optional feature to configure your providers</p>
      <p begin="00:43:11.980" end="00:43:16.530">for testing purposes if you took advantage of that we are going to...populated</p>
      <p begin="00:43:16.530" end="00:43:21.240">for-you in-depth center so that you don't have to do it again however dead-center is the source of</p>
      <p begin="00:43:21.240" end="00:43:26.690">truth and we would still require that you review this metadata and hidden explicit save so</p>
      <p begin="00:43:26.690" end="00:43:29.560">...go ahead and collapse these two since we have the metadata</p>
      <p begin="00:43:29.560" end="00:43:34.520">...configure them so I'm going to choose ad duplex to be a backup provider and I'm going-to go</p>
      <p begin="00:43:34.520" end="00:43:39.440">ahead and give smart to thirty percent of the distribution now you</p>
      <p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:43.880">will know the microsoft advertising by default decreases seventy percent because the some</p>
      <p begin="00:43:43.880" end="00:43:48.410">of the distribution must always equal hundred now let's explain what</p>
      <p begin="00:43:48.410" end="00:43:53.230">it means that microsoft is at seventy percent...model is...thirty every time the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:53.230" end="00:43:57.050">...control is ready to request...we roll the dice we call that</p>
      <p begin="00:43:57.050" end="00:44:01.670">a mediation session now seventy percent of the time in this case we're going to request ad</p>
      <p begin="00:44:01.670" end="00:44:05.290">from microsoft advertising and thirty percent of the time we're going to request</p>
      <p begin="00:44:05.290" end="00:44:07.580">...from smarter if one doesn't have an</p>
      <p begin="00:44:07.580" end="00:44:12.430">...we're going to try the other if both don't have an added we're going to try one of our</p>
      <p begin="00:44:12.430" end="00:44:17.860">backup providers so let's go ahead and save this baseline configuration and</p>
      <p begin="00:44:17.860" end="00:44:20.970">wallets saving and by the way I will just point out</p>
      <p begin="00:44:20.970" end="00:44:24.250">...any metadata for microsoft advertising it's all done for</p>
      <p begin="00:44:24.250" end="00:44:28.220">...writing so while this well this finish saving let's talk about a</p>
      <p begin="00:44:28.220" end="00:44:32.920">market specific scenario so let's assume that I.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:32.920" end="00:44:37.860">...the game in the argentinean market just for my argentinean customers and</p>
      <p begin="00:44:37.860" end="00:44:42.020">that I have multiple apps and games and the argentinean market so let's go ahead and create</p>
      <p begin="00:44:42.020" end="00:44:46.950">and argentina's specific configuration so from the target I'm going-to go ahead I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:44:46.950" end="00:44:52.330">to choose argentina and then you will note that first inherits from the baseline so that</p>
      <p begin="00:44:52.330" end="00:44:53.950">you're starting point.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:53.950" end="00:44:58.440">Now I've created house campaign for this new game in argentina and I would actually like to</p>
      <p begin="00:44:58.440" end="00:45:02.920">make an investment and use ten percent of my supply to show this cross</p>
      <p begin="00:45:02.920" end="00:45:07.790">promotional campaign so I'm going-to go ahead I'm going to change house ads going-to-take it all the way</p>
      <p begin="00:45:07.790" end="00:45:12.550">to ten percent and I'm going-to go ahead and lock it so that I can configure the other providers without</p>
      <p begin="00:45:12.550" end="00:45:18.130">impacting that number now let's assume that's model is faring horribly...argentina and we never</p>
      <p begin="00:45:18.130" end="00:45:23.160">want to call-in argentina not even as a backup we can go ahead and we can...all the way</p>
      <p begin="00:45:23.160" end="00:45:27.800">to an active the assemblies for smart or still going to be part of the package that is</p>
      <p begin="00:45:27.800" end="00:45:32.230">in the catalog...devices and argentine are never going to call smart...not even as a</p>
      <p begin="00:45:32.230" end="00:45:36.860">backup now let's assume the opposite let's assume that's motto is exceptionally well</p>
      <p begin="00:45:36.860" end="00:45:41.810">in argentina and in fact we wanted to be the dominant provider there we can go ahead and move</p>
      <p begin="00:45:41.810" end="00:45:48.130">smarter let's move it all the way to eighty percent.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:48.130" end="00:45:52.550">Microsoft advertising reduced to ten percent we keep our ten percent investment in our house</p>
      <p begin="00:45:52.550" end="00:45:57.650">campaign this looks good let's go ahead and say this market specific configuration so</p>
      <p begin="00:45:57.650" end="00:46:01.280">the last piece is how devices and argentine actually</p>
      <p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:05.580">going to start behaving according to this mediation so we set up a service</p>
      <p begin="00:46:05.580" end="00:46:10.150">that allows all the devices out there in the world to call home every twenty four hours and</p>
      <p begin="00:46:10.150" end="00:46:15.380">...you configuration is available so in this case since we just created the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:15.380" end="00:46:20.180">...configuration all the devices running my app and argentina are going to</p>
      <p begin="00:46:20.180" end="00:46:24.460">start consuming this configuration and acting by it.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:24.460" end="00:46:26.390">So, to finish off the windows</p>
      <p begin="00:46:26.390" end="00:46:32.090">ad mediation section let's go and take a look at reporting so since I</p>
      <p begin="00:46:32.090" end="00:46:37.580">wanted to use and...that actually has a lot of traffic and...of users and has been using successfully the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:37.580" end="00:46:42.660">...mediator we chose an internal successful developers app called</p>
      <p begin="00:46:42.660" end="00:46:45.280">...hd and let's take a look at the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:45.280" end="00:46:51.130">aggregation reports that are available under the analytics heading and the context of your...and I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:46:51.130" end="00:46:56.040">to go over those fairly quickly their well-documented and we can continue talking about them also after the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:56.040" end="00:47:00.770">session so the first report is just your general ad mediation performance</p>
      <p begin="00:47:00.770" end="00:47:04.410">...it shows your ...rate the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:04.410" end="00:47:09.250">number of mediation sessions and then the number of ads delivered let's go back to the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:09.250" end="00:47:14.100">fill rate you'll know that in this case the average...rate is a hundred-percent I do want to call out</p>
      <p begin="00:47:14.100" end="00:47:17.150">the charts here use as an...value the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:17.150" end="00:47:22.150">mean value for the data available and in fact the mean value here is ninety nine-point-five</p>
      <p begin="00:47:22.150" end="00:47:24.520">for so this developers achieving</p>
      <p begin="00:47:24.520" end="00:47:29.090">and near one hundred percent failure rate in fact mathematically rounded to hundred-percent</p>
      <p begin="00:47:29.090" end="00:47:34.100">...rate using windows at mediation now this developers using all these</p>
      <p begin="00:47:34.100" end="00:47:37.920">at providers five ad providers and we provide you also with the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:37.920" end="00:47:40.850">fill rate for each one of those and this is a straightforward</p>
      <p begin="00:47:40.850" end="00:47:45.380">...rate calculation which is basically ads delivered divided by requests?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:45.380" end="00:47:49.520">Finally there's a unique users per mediation configuration so if you</p>
      <p begin="00:47:49.520" end="00:47:54.580">recall we created a specific configuration for argentina but let's take a more</p>
      <p begin="00:47:54.580" end="00:47:59.280">a simpler example the other configuration you've looked at the cp m across all</p>
      <p begin="00:47:59.280" end="00:48:04.570">your providers and now you want to make a change to favor a provider that now is the high</p>
      <p begin="00:48:04.570" end="00:48:07.860">...provider you go to the configuration you make the changes</p>
      <p begin="00:48:07.860" end="00:48:12.030">...you want to know at which point you have a critical mass of devices</p>
      <p begin="00:48:12.030" end="00:48:16.400">and users who have consume this configuration before you make decisions whether to</p>
      <p begin="00:48:16.400" end="00:48:21.970">keep that configuration or to make edits to it and in this charge you'll be able to see</p>
      <p begin="00:48:21.970" end="00:48:26.320">and this example we see that there's there's a very dominance configuration that applies</p>
      <p begin="00:48:26.320" end="00:48:29.430">...the majority of users and then finally we provide you</p>
      <p begin="00:48:29.430" end="00:48:34.780">to error breakdowns the first one just gives you the error rate for each</p>
      <p begin="00:48:34.780" end="00:48:39.110">...provider and it's a it's a straightforward what percent percentage of all</p>
      <p begin="00:48:39.110" end="00:48:44.440">ad requests resulted in an error instead of a valid response now I want to point out that</p>
      <p begin="00:48:44.440" end="00:48:47.570">a valid response would be either an ads or no</p>
      <p begin="00:48:47.570" end="00:48:52.170">...right not having demand is not an error case but then let's say that,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:52.170" end="00:48:56.270">for example, here and interactively see sixteen percent error rate if you want to know</p>
      <p begin="00:48:56.270" end="00:49:01.790">what's causing those errors we provide an additional error breakdown by type and this is a new</p>
      <p begin="00:49:01.790" end="00:49:06.590">report that we have that we that doesn't exist in the windows phone portal right now so</p>
      <p begin="00:49:06.590" end="00:49:10.920">...the case of interactive we can see that there's two error types that are contributing to all</p>
      <p begin="00:49:10.920" end="00:49:16.230">their errors and eighty three percent of all the eras are related to this one so</p>
      <p begin="00:49:16.230" end="00:49:19.560">in our documentation we provide explanation on each one of those</p>
      <p begin="00:49:19.560" end="00:49:24.820">...types and the right strategies to address them and reduce them.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:24.820" end="00:49:33.450">So, with that let's go back to the presentation.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.450" end="00:49:38.130">So, currently side-by-side with microsoft we have seven mediation partners that are already</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38.130" end="00:49:43.550">practicing participating with windows at mediation and more coming in the pipeline if</p>
      <p begin="00:49:43.550" end="00:49:48.080">you using it for windows phone you'll be able to consume your reports in the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:48.080" end="00:49:52.450">previewed of center however you will not be able to make configuration changes to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:52.450" end="00:49:57.890">configurations done in the windows phone portal bear with us for a few more weeks and once the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:57.890" end="00:50:02.700">preview dead-center opens up you'll be open for business with windows at mediation and we're very excited to</p>
      <p begin="00:50:02.700" end="00:50:09.260">see how you like it all right so let's summarize what we talked about today and we started out</p>
      <p begin="00:50:09.260" end="00:50:13.510">we're talking about app promotion and we talked about how we added...targeting</p>
      <p begin="00:50:13.510" end="00:50:18.470">and additional manual targeting capabilities and also we're going to start reporting on</p>
      <p begin="00:50:18.470" end="00:50:23.250">installs so you can calculates dpi then we moved on to talk about the windows ten</p>
      <p begin="00:50:23.250" end="00:50:27.290">ad sdk how it supports native apps how it's going to be shipped...an</p>
      <p begin="00:50:27.290" end="00:50:30.610">...framework so that you don't have to update your app whenever we update</p>
      <p begin="00:50:30.610" end="00:50:35.610">our sdk and how interstitial ads for the fifth...</p>
      <p begin="00:50:35.610" end="00:50:40.400">...announce now for microsoft advertising it is actually a big deal you have an opportunity to make a</p>
      <p begin="00:50:40.400" end="00:50:44.160">lot more money in your apps and games and then finally we talked about</p>
      <p begin="00:50:44.160" end="00:50:45.960">ad mediation and how windows</p>
      <p begin="00:50:45.960" end="00:50:50.100">...mediation makes it very easy for you to plug-and-play third-party</p>
      <p begin="00:50:50.100" end="00:50:50.770">ad providers?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:51.850" end="00:50:54.470">Getting a high...rate and favoring your icy</p>
      <p begin="00:50:54.470" end="00:50:59.350">...providers and then finally...like the one meta</p>
      <p begin="00:50:59.350" end="00:51:04.250">...point is no more will you have to go to multiple portals dead-center is truly</p>
      <p begin="00:51:04.250" end="00:51:09.060">your one-stop-shop for app development and add monetize a shun</p>
      <p begin="00:51:09.060" end="00:51:19.950">an app promotion so we're very excited about that and hopefully so are you.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:19.950" end="00:51:24.660">All right so little bit of call-to-action will first of all like I said promoter app is available</p>
      <p begin="00:51:24.660" end="00:51:27.940">and preview dead-center so go and use it and until</p>
      <p begin="00:51:27.940" end="00:51:30.610">preview dead-center becomes the only</p>
      <p begin="00:51:30.610" end="00:51:35.440">dead-center available pub center is going to continue being alive so</p>

      <p begin="00:55:10.370" end="00:55:15.440">gate we're not going to support mediation for interstitial I do want to point out that when you...that</p>

      <p begin="00:55:26.110" end="00:55:30.380">provider that works on the windows ecosystem is microsoft advertising and</p>
      <p begin="00:55:36.480" end="00:55:40.960">So, let's actually talk about that...definitely thinking of mediation for interstitial but</p>
      <p begin="00:55:40.960" end="00:55:45.040">of the gate we're not going to have mediation fairness st.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:45.040" end="00:55:50.930">Our question about install tracking real you do integrations</p>
      <p begin="00:55:50.930" end="00:55:53.340">with a third parties</p>
      <p begin="00:55:53.340" end="00:55:57.000">...to send this information back to them</p>
      <p begin="00:55:57.000" end="00:56:01.810">to like most of the install...companies the what they do the</p>
      <p begin="00:56:01.810" end="00:56:04.380">provide special urls for.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:04.380" end="00:56:07.580">Each partner network that and information</p>
      <p begin="00:56:07.580" end="00:56:12.540">is post back to that network so, for example, if you like advertise with</p>
      <p begin="00:56:12.540" end="00:56:16.440">us and use a instill...from</p>
      <p begin="00:56:16.440" end="00:56:21.220">...they will send the information back to asked our...</p>
      <p begin="00:56:21.220" end="00:56:27.120">result...will there be something on this was so</p>
      <p begin="00:56:27.120" end="00:56:31.420">this so obviously currently...are not exposing that beta occur as I</p>
      <p begin="00:56:31.420" end="00:56:36.350">mentioned earlier we're also moving into the camping attribution tracking that windows</p>
      <p begin="00:56:36.350" end="00:56:41.740">ten provides I would done right so with the first party campaign attribution that</p>
      <p begin="00:56:41.740" end="00:56:45.670">...releasing with windows ten we're making it easy for you to</p>
      <p begin="00:56:45.670" end="00:56:49.180">...the url that will direct to the to the page you</p>
      <p begin="00:56:49.180" end="00:56:53.390">on the store and then if there's a conversion the attribution</p>
      <p begin="00:56:53.390" end="00:56:56.110">...that conversion is stored as part of the what we</p>
      <p begin="00:56:56.110" end="00:57:00.270">call the entitlement what that really means for you is that when the app runs</p>
      <p begin="00:57:00.270" end="00:57:04.920">it will have programmatic access to that attribution a lot of the way that these</p>
      <p begin="00:57:04.920" end="00:57:10.720">third-party implementations work is that they give you a piece of sdk that app launch will</p>
      <p begin="00:57:10.720" end="00:57:15.880">go and grab the attribution somehow and, then send it to that third-party so</p>
      <p begin="00:57:15.880" end="00:57:19.180">they can match the click event with the conversion so we are</p>
      <p begin="00:57:19.180" end="00:57:24.130">absolutely enabling that with the first party attribution solution from windows</p>
      <p begin="00:57:24.130" end="00:57:27.020">tent and we are also collaborating closely with</p>
      <p begin="00:57:27.020" end="00:57:32.430">the advertising team for them to onboard that solution the details haven't been</p>
      <p begin="00:57:32.430" end="00:57:37.060">figured out yet but that absolutely were aware this is a top requirement for</p>
      <p begin="00:57:37.060" end="00:57:44.190">the campaign attribution feature and were fully committed to making that feature fully baked?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:44.190" end="00:57:50.910">Thank you.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:50.910" end="00:57:55.460">Do you have an example ofgave more apt that could have made a lot more</p>
      <p begin="00:57:55.460" end="00:58:00.110">...it would have used data advertisement in about...</p>
      <p begin="00:58:00.110" end="00:58:04.900">As you so loaded...the short answer is yes however,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:06.290" end="00:58:09.130">we are limited in what disclosure we can do</p>
      <p begin="00:58:09.130" end="00:58:15.330">informs like that so how about you come to the insider...and we can have some more</p>
      <p begin="00:58:15.330" end="00:58:19.480">one-on-one conversation but could you say what they did wrong without specifying</p>
      <p begin="00:58:19.480" end="00:58:24.330">the up or something so I may have misunderstood the question did wrong</p>
      <p begin="00:58:24.330" end="00:58:30.680">...what regard in how the use of a advertise and steps to make money.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:30.680" end="00:58:34.170">So, I wouldn't say that there's examples of how people</p>
      <p begin="00:58:34.170" end="00:58:39.170">used advertising offering wrong I think that there are capabilities are you</p>
      <p begin="00:58:39.170" end="00:58:44.330">referring to the to the interstitial in particular or no...on read layout</p>
      <p begin="00:58:44.330" end="00:58:49.420">to make mana with advertisement...so games so, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:49.420" end="00:58:54.630">I would say that this really touches on the meta point that we were making this session right if you're not using</p>
      <p begin="00:58:54.630" end="00:58:58.790">ad mediation you are leaving money on the ground if you're not using interstitial ads in</p>
      <p begin="00:58:58.790" end="00:59:03.780">addition to banner ads you are leaving money on the ground if you're not acquiring more users with</p>
      <p begin="00:59:03.780" end="00:59:08.210">our app promotion cross-promotions feature you are missing out on users</p>
      <p begin="00:59:08.210" end="00:59:13.200">that otherwise engage with your app increase your supply which will then result</p>
      <p begin="00:59:13.200" end="00:59:18.520">and more money for you especially with that mediation so the cycle continues so I wouldn't say that</p>
      <p begin="00:59:18.520" end="00:59:23.780">there's are wrong approach I mean you could definitely implemented in a way that</p>
      <p begin="00:59:23.780" end="00:59:28.620">...codebook wouldn't work but I think...developers need to remember</p>
      <p begin="00:59:28.620" end="00:59:33.790">is that we have a lot more opportunity and windows ten to increase your</p>
      <p begin="00:59:33.790" end="00:59:37.300">dollars from advertising either through user acquisition or</p>
      <p begin="00:59:37.300" end="00:59:50.000">through our mediation and the additional...experiences solutions ok thank you?</p>
      <p begin="00:59:50.000" end="00:59:56.230">So, for the ad mediation what can we expect for some of the providers that I think</p>
      <p begin="00:59:56.230" end="01:00:01.390">they mainly target mobile now with universal windows apps if we set up at</p>
      <p begin="01:00:02.490" end="01:00:06.060">...we are they just not going to fill those or how does that</p>
      <p begin="01:00:06.060" end="01:00:11.570">can so, you know,...I can say about this and we should continue more</p>
      <p begin="01:00:11.570" end="01:00:16.020">...as we are working aggressively with many partners</p>
      <p begin="01:00:17.080" end="01:00:21.650">to on board...onto the windows ecosystem support from</p>
      <p begin="01:00:21.650" end="01:00:26.600">...app provider perspective we're also thinking about how we can architect</p>
      <p begin="01:00:26.600" end="01:00:30.090">ad mediation in such a way that would enable multiple</p>
      <p begin="01:00:30.090" end="01:00:35.420">ad providers to come...easily to the windows ecosystem so</p>
      <p begin="01:00:35.420" end="01:00:39.940">we in fact I can provide any details right now but we expect</p>
      <p begin="01:00:39.940" end="01:00:45.040">significant...in the number of mediation partners following that we architecture...</p>
      <p begin="01:00:45.040" end="01:00:47.420">that's kinda like it's more like a strategies future</p>
      <p begin="01:00:49.050" end="01:00:58.600">coming facing thinking but we're engaged in that thinking right now?</p>
      <p begin="01:00:58.600" end="01:01:05.090">All right we're just on time again thank you very much and maybe cod insider</p>
      <p begin="01:01:05.090" end="01:01:05.440">Thank you.</p>
