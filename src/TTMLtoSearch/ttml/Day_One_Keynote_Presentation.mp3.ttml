      <p begin="00:01:06.520" end="00:01:11.070">For me in some sense this conference.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.780" end="00:01:13.730">Is all?</p>

      <p begin="00:01:36.860" end="00:01:38.090">And, that.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.090" end="00:01:42.110">Phenomenon is not new.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.110" end="00:01:50.720">In fact it goes back to the very origin of our company.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.720" end="00:01:53.950">Microsoft was founded by to developers.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.610" end="00:02:00.420">Who had a bold ambition to empower other</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:04.080">developers to build new and great thanks?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:05.330" end="00:02:09.310">In fact that tweet you see on the screen.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.310" end="00:02:10.940">Is the tweet from paul allen on</p>

      <p begin="00:02:34.320" end="00:02:37.250">When you look at it that?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:37.250" end="00:02:37.750">Ethos.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.050" end="00:02:42.270">Laws changed in the forty-year since.</p>

      <p begin="00:03:43.630" end="00:03:48.540">morning's keynote is perhaps the broadest lens through which we</p>
      <p begin="00:03:48.540" end="00:03:55.690">...developers development and platforms?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:55.690" end="00:03:59.630">We're going to want developers from student developers to</p>

      <p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:44.300">Concept of that approach.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:44.300" end="00:04:45.520">Is something that's going to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:54.860">be deeply ingrained in everything we do across all of our platforms?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:54.860" end="00:04:59.130">Over the last year I've had a chance to talk to many developers.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:00.530" end="00:05:03.110">Throughout the world.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:03.110" end="00:05:06.790">I met a couple student developers...in developers who won the imagine</p>

      <p begin="00:06:07.620" end="00:06:09.000">To kickoff build.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:10.080" end="00:06:15.060">By talking to one such developer.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.060" end="00:06:18.430">In fact he's a musician.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.430" end="00:06:21.030">Who had a dream and...calls himself</p>

      <p begin="00:06:25.330" end="00:06:26.600">To change.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:26.600" end="00:06:30.910">How music is compose?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:30.910" end="00:06:36.610">Please help me welcome david william...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.610" end="00:06:41.570">Hi, david hi great senior great to be the thanks for coming</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.570" end="00:06:45.130">up it's like...do you tell us a little bit...your dream your</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.130" end="00:06:50.020">...so far absolutely so music notation is probably something that a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.020" end="00:06:54.670">lot of you in this room haven't really thought about before but it really is the written language</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.670" end="00:06:59.150">of music it's almost like a coding language of music actually...it has some similarities</p>
      <p begin="00:06:59.150" end="00:07:06.310">with code you can even write-in csharp or upshot...probably better for...very.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:06.310" end="00:07:11.080">That's until now there's been to main ways you can really write music traditionally using</p>
      <p begin="00:07:11.080" end="00:07:14.390">...paper which is very creative maybe not that</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.390" end="00:07:19.250">convenience sometimes all the digital way which is very laborious</p>
      <p begin="00:07:19.250" end="00:07:24.150">to input but very convenient once it's in that form so I really wanted to make something where you</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.150" end="00:07:28.510">could take the creativity and convenience and smashing together and create this</p>
      <p begin="00:07:28.510" end="00:07:31.600">...way of writing music amazing...want to show us what</p>
      <p begin="00:07:31.600" end="00:07:42.830">you built absolutely subtler stuff that is handwriting recognition for media notation.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:42.830" end="00:07:45.930">But, I've actually been working on a piece the last few weeks.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:45.930" end="00:07:47.420">A piece of string quartet and piano.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:48.490" end="00:07:50.430">As you can see I can use touch to interact with the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:50.430" end="00:07:56.290">school you could a big school here this is note nursery rhyme.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:56.290" end="00:08:01.190">And, let's go to the and we've got a couple of...left to do so I figured we could finish it up on stage and</p>
      <p begin="00:08:01.190" end="00:08:04.910">...your...music illiterate but go aheadwell,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:04.910" end="00:08:05.980">I don't...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:07.490" end="00:08:13.680">okay let's just take the pen I'm going to start writing in the bars so it's very</p>
      <p begin="00:08:13.680" end="00:08:23.940">natural the idea behind the app was if you could write...should be able to a?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:23.940" end="00:08:28.150">If you can write music you should be able to know how to use the app you don't need to really learned too much</p>
      <p begin="00:08:28.150" end="00:08:32.240">...very intuitive as...move into the next bar.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:34.040">...notations recognized intended to</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.040" end="00:08:37.809">...innovation moi thank you moi.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:46.720" end="00:08:51.230">But, actually this is actually interactive notation now so I can...dot.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:51.230" end="00:08:53.970">And, maybe I should slur some of these to.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:53.970" end="00:08:58.460">You think swimming's play like you drunk okay I'm getting so much trouble flap.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:58.460" end="00:09:03.550">Using touch I can...bar...and just pull this out this is a great thing about surface</p>
      <p begin="00:09:03.550" end="00:09:06.010">and windows was really the only platform that we could do this</p>
      <p begin="00:09:06.010" end="00:09:10.680">for because it really understands the difference between my fingers and the pen and that</p>
      <p begin="00:09:10.680" end="00:09:14.440">...that's really...making this into to the natural I'm just going to say this</p>
      <p begin="00:09:14.440" end="00:09:18.660">...beat...that using the pena...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:18.660" end="00:09:24.540">And,...in a string run here.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:24.540" end="00:09:28.700">...that up and you can see that we've got a nice flash stringing up to the top</p>
      <p begin="00:09:28.700" end="00:09:32.330">so let me just to one less thing double...copy this down.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.400" end="00:09:35.610">That's cool.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:35.610" end="00:09:38.290">So, let on that.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.290" end="00:09:40.950">Okay, and, we can play this back.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:46.410" end="00:09:52.200">What's the also...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:52.200" end="00:09:56.280">What's...reaction I know that this has been out for a few months is it now</p>
      <p begin="00:09:56.280" end="00:10:00.830">...just a few weeks...the...already been absolutely incredible breathtaking</p>
      <p begin="00:10:00.830" end="00:10:05.520">really we've heard from people all over the world we have an eleven-year-old composer...writing</p>
      <p begin="00:10:05.520" end="00:10:11.090">her second up for on the...first...second andninety one-year-old</p>
      <p begin="00:10:11.090" end="00:10:16.230">...back in love with writing music again it's really been this students ...in the classroom</p>
      <p begin="00:10:16.230" end="00:10:21.060">to classroom and it's really just an incredible reaction has been breathtaking awesome thank you so much</p>
      <p begin="00:10:21.060" end="00:10:28.470">...the megawatt.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:28.470" end="00:10:32.680">That's what's most striking about today's developers...all of you</p>
      <p begin="00:10:32.680" end="00:10:37.580">which is one person or a small group of people with...dream</p>
      <p begin="00:10:37.580" end="00:10:42.340">in a passion can have such huge impact.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:42.340" end="00:10:47.090">By taking advantage of these platform technologies who would've thought that music</p>
      <p begin="00:10:47.090" end="00:10:51.970">composition can be changed with touch in inc and that's what we live</p>
      <p begin="00:10:51.970" end="00:10:56.930">for as a platform company we want to be able to take inspiration from the apps</p>
      <p begin="00:10:56.930" end="00:11:02.670">you build drive platform innovation so today's keynote</p>
      <p begin="00:11:02.670" end="00:11:07.290">is about three major platform transformations and</p>
      <p begin="00:11:07.290" end="00:11:11.510">...we want to talk about first</p>
      <p begin="00:11:11.510" end="00:11:13.580">are cloud platform.</p>

      <p begin="00:18:51.500" end="00:18:57.080">on stage it build in fact I talk about the five big surprises that we've had in working with</p>
      <p begin="00:18:57.080" end="00:19:01.940">microsoft at all or many relate to this notion of how we can take openness</p>
      <p begin="00:19:01.940" end="00:19:07.150">and portability and flexibility and use it to empower developers now if you're not familiar with</p>
      <p begin="00:19:07.150" end="00:19:10.730">...started two years ago by solomon hikes who felt that</p>
      <p begin="00:19:10.730" end="00:19:14.030">developers fundamentally are spending far too much of their time.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:14.030" end="00:19:18.350">Doing rework worrying about dependencies wearing about servers instead of just building awesome</p>
      <p begin="00:19:18.350" end="00:19:23.270">apps and initial innovation was let's make it possible to take any application and</p>
      <p begin="00:19:23.270" end="00:19:27.900">its dependencies package them up in the digital equivalent...shipping container</p>
      <p begin="00:19:27.900" end="00:19:32.370">enable any application that stock rise to interact with any other...rise application</p>
      <p begin="00:19:32.370" end="00:19:37.860">and run any server the last october when we went up to meet with microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:19:37.860" end="00:19:41.040">...proud of the fact...networking for linux you could take any</p>
      <p begin="00:19:41.040" end="00:19:45.010">linux application...arise...and run it on any linux server and quite frankly we</p>
      <p begin="00:19:45.010" end="00:19:48.030">saw we leaves redmond with an agreement to make</p>
      <p begin="00:19:48.030" end="00:19:50.760">...for linux run well on hyper v or run well</p>
      <p begin="00:19:50.760" end="00:19:56.360">...manager but then we have the first of those big five surprises and the first big surprise was that we</p>
      <p begin="00:19:56.360" end="00:20:01.420">were not only...work on docket for linux we're going to work on doctor for windows so we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:20:01.420" end="00:20:05.420">enabled...four million...linux developers to join all the millions of</p>
      <p begin="00:20:05.420" end="00:20:09.850">...windows developers and make it possible using standard darker using</p>
      <p begin="00:20:09.850" end="00:20:13.870">open-source to take any windows application</p>
      <p begin="00:20:13.870" end="00:20:18.970">...and run it on any server second-rate...that we had was this</p>
      <p begin="00:20:18.970" end="00:20:23.220">is not only about code was also about content collaboration</p>
      <p begin="00:20:23.220" end="00:20:28.430">...familiar with doctor, you know, we have a service called...hub that has about one hundred twenty thousand</p>

      <p begin="00:20:40.100" end="00:20:45.910">opensource dot net for links components delivered again is doctor containers to the hub.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:45.910" end="00:20:50.500">Third-grade surprised that we had was that microsoft embrace the notion of what you need to do to</p>
      <p begin="00:20:50.500" end="00:20:55.180">make multi container apps work and embrace the notion if you want to make most container</p>
      <p begin="00:20:55.180" end="00:20:59.930">apps truly portable you have to be open about how you do orchestration as well so</p>
      <p begin="00:20:59.930" end="00:21:04.920">were so thrilled that microsoft has embrace dockers open orchestration initiatives compose machine</p>
      <p begin="00:21:04.920" end="00:21:08.090">...warm fourth-grade surprising yes,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:08.090" end="00:21:14.160">there's more ...those three things you're not only going to be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:21:14.160" end="00:21:18.190">make great multi container windows applications a great multi container</p>
      <p begin="00:21:18.190" end="00:21:23.720">windows applications you'll be able to mix and match windows containers</p>
      <p begin="00:21:23.720" end="00:21:27.110">...containers which means you'll be able to use a linux back-end</p>
      <p begin="00:21:27.110" end="00:21:31.310">...windows front-end or vice versa basically choose the best damn tools for the best</p>
      <p begin="00:21:31.310" end="00:21:35.480">...application that you want to build and run it on any server.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:35.480" end="00:21:39.000">And, the...and perhaps...surprise we've had working with microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:21:39.000" end="00:21:43.880">...is happen quickly and everything that I've spoken about is either live or working well in the</p>

      <p begin="00:23:33.770" end="00:23:37.730">I can see the ip address of the website that's going to launch that fabric</p>

      <p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:49.200">really fun parts about using the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:52.980">...client is that if you don't specify name for your container it comes up with</p>

      <p begin="00:24:06.890" end="00:24:11.440">at website now which is going to be active launch ieee.</p>

      <p begin="00:24:49.040" end="00:24:51.000">So, here I've got the same exact application</p>
      <p begin="00:24:52.180" end="00:24:57.660">and this time I'm going to sh into a linux virtual machine and run the</p>

      <p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:01.980">...let's step back for a second get an understanding about how this fits</p>
      <p begin="00:37:01.980" end="00:37:05.840">...we've got web apps we've got mobile applications</p>
      <p begin="00:37:05.840" end="00:37:10.700">those are talking to api in the back-end when I submitted my order</p>

      <p begin="00:37:15.360" end="00:37:20.150">Those api apps can be written by me or they can be written by third-party or brought in</p>
      <p begin="00:37:20.150" end="00:37:24.700">from our marketplace but...really interesting thing is this concept of logic</p>
      <p begin="00:37:24.700" end="00:37:29.350">applications because there's business processes like when that order gets completed I want to get</p>
      <p begin="00:37:29.350" end="00:37:41.650">notified as a customer about that so let's take a look at what a logic application.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:41.650" end="00:37:45.990">Let me switch over here we go so this is an application here where</p>
      <p begin="00:37:45.990" end="00:37:50.310">we've got individual api apps the sequel connector is going</p>
      <p begin="00:37:50.310" end="00:37:54.770">to be looking at the data for the orders and then it flows through this</p>
      <p begin="00:37:54.770" end="00:37:59.440">workflow from one api up to another using a technology called swagger</p>
      <p begin="00:37:59.440" end="00:38:04.410">where that metadata is going to the system into sales force and then in this case</p>
      <p begin="00:38:04.410" end="00:38:05.800">we're posting a message to</p>
      <p begin="00:38:05.800" end="00:38:10.530">slack I can bring in that order api that we created</p>
      <p begin="00:38:10.530" end="00:38:15.190">in sp net and then get the details for that order you see that</p>
      <p begin="00:38:15.190" end="00:38:18.220">actually got populated using that swagger details and</p>
      <p begin="00:38:18.220" end="00:38:22.940">then it knows about previous things within this workflow</p>
      <p begin="00:38:22.940" end="00:38:28.340">is a reliable durable workflow in the cloud and now I can click on truly</p>
      <p begin="00:38:28.340" end="00:38:32.200">...and bringing that truly a connector and then send a message to let</p>
      <p begin="00:38:32.200" end="00:38:35.790">me know when this when this order is completed.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:36.860" end="00:38:40.000">So, here I can access any aspects of</p>
      <p begin="00:38:40.000" end="00:38:44.340">...flowing through the system in this case outlook at the</p>

      <p begin="00:38:52.540" end="00:38:58.740">And, then under text here we're going to have.</p>

      <p begin="01:11:32.120" end="01:11:35.000">And, if everyone did that we would eradicate poverty.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:36.120" end="01:11:40.790">We would put cancer out of business now...team had the task of trying to</p>
      <p begin="01:11:40.790" end="01:11:44.570">understand why that isn't happening using analytics using machine</p>
      <p begin="01:11:44.570" end="01:11:50.060">learning and getting a real understanding as to how we think and how we make that decision to give and</p>
      <p begin="01:11:50.060" end="01:11:54.610">our analytics has identified three key things that are product needed to</p>
      <p begin="01:11:54.610" end="01:11:58.400">use data for the first is that it needed to change giving from</p>
      <p begin="01:11:58.400" end="01:12:03.290">being a transactional activity to something that's far more engaging it also</p>
      <p begin="01:12:03.290" end="01:12:07.450">needed to be personal of course it needed to be social after</p>
      <p begin="01:12:07.450" end="01:12:11.620">...we sold some of the biggest problems as human species by connecting with each</p>
      <p begin="01:12:11.620" end="01:12:17.000">other and collaborating but at the heart of all of this is that we needed to</p>
      <p begin="01:12:17.000" end="01:12:21.580">make giving personal which for us means we need to understand what you specifically</p>
      <p begin="01:12:21.580" end="01:12:26.430">care about traditional ways of trying to address personalization would use things like</p>
      <p begin="01:12:26.430" end="01:12:31.240">look-alikes or collaborative filtering but in this space that doesn't work what</p>
      <p begin="01:12:31.240" end="01:12:37.130">you care about a specific to you if you care about cancer or beating cancer</p>
      <p begin="01:12:37.130" end="01:12:40.910">icon find somebody who looks like you and say that they also care</p>
      <p begin="01:12:40.910" end="01:12:45.890">about cancer everybody has something specific that they care about however using</p>
      <p begin="01:12:45.890" end="01:12:50.660">machine learning and graph theory on this platform we've managed to</p>
      <p begin="01:12:50.660" end="01:12:55.360">crack that problem in fact what we've done is we've built a machine</p>
      <p begin="01:12:55.360" end="01:12:59.440">does that those three specific things first of all it understand how</p>
      <p begin="01:12:59.440" end="01:13:03.360">you specifically want to give giving isn't just about money</p>
      <p begin="01:13:03.360" end="01:13:06.400">it understands whether you want to give time or</p>
      <p begin="01:13:06.400" end="01:13:10.350">whether you want to give effort secondly the algorithm can</p>
      <p begin="01:13:10.350" end="01:13:15.310">work out specifically what you care about and it also understands that what you</p>
      <p begin="01:13:15.310" end="01:13:19.970">care about changes it's a moving database it's not static it</p>
      <p begin="01:13:19.970" end="01:13:22.160">...your circumstances change as</p>
      <p begin="01:13:22.160" end="01:13:25.680">your associations change and the more interactive you become?</p>
      <p begin="01:13:26.740" end="01:13:31.070">An lastly my most favorite part of the algorithm is that it understands how</p>
      <p begin="01:13:31.070" end="01:13:35.980">to interact with you specifically with you to make giving more engaging and</p>
      <p begin="01:13:35.980" end="01:13:40.740">remove those barriers that might exist to stop you from giving now we couldn't have</p>
      <p begin="01:13:40.740" end="01:13:43.830">done is without the is your platform where small</p>
      <p begin="01:13:43.830" end="01:13:48.650">team of scientists and engineers and what is your platform really allowed us to do</p>
      <p begin="01:13:48.650" end="01:13:53.580">was focus intensely on our goal we don't have a team of operations experts</p>
      <p begin="01:13:53.580" end="01:13:58.870">...can managing huge cluster of what you...machines in the cloud but this platform</p>
      <p begin="01:13:58.870" end="01:14:03.460">was ideal for us and these are the components that we used and this is how we</p>
      <p begin="01:14:03.460" end="01:14:07.420">architected them essentially had three core processes we had a</p>
      <p begin="01:14:07.420" end="01:14:12.060">batch process which runs nightly a real-time process and approaches that allowed us to put our</p>

      <p begin="01:14:14.940" end="01:14:18.130">And, the...batch process is the backbone</p>
      <p begin="01:14:18.130" end="01:14:21.000">for everything that we do and at the center of it is hd</p>
      <p begin="01:14:21.000" end="01:14:26.660">insight this is where we do all of our large calculations this is where we build the give</p>
      <p begin="01:14:26.660" end="01:14:31.480">graph that I showed you earlier so essentially we take all of our data we uploaded into</p>
      <p begin="01:14:31.480" end="01:14:34.170">blob storage...spin up the clusters and do all</p>
      <p begin="01:14:34.170" end="01:14:38.630">of our calculations and once that's done the...a put down in the datas moved</p>
      <p begin="01:14:38.630" end="01:14:42.280">on toas your table storage and that same time we have a</p>
      <p begin="01:14:42.280" end="01:14:47.120">real-time service that helps us keep this product interactive...providing data to the</p>
      <p begin="01:14:47.120" end="01:14:52.100">machines so that it can learn and it can continue to become more effective these are</p>
      <p begin="01:14:52.100" end="01:14:56.940">...mailboxes and your service...for that of course we have visual websites</p>
      <p begin="01:14:56.940" end="01:15:00.900">...or the...web app which is where we put our idi</p>
      <p begin="01:15:00.900" end="01:15:04.780">...and where the product has access to it and all of this</p>
      <p begin="01:15:04.780" end="01:15:09.480">manifests itself on the product itself this is what...feed looks like this is what</p>
      <p begin="01:15:09.480" end="01:15:13.430">...our and what's exciting is that this is where we</p>
      <p begin="01:15:13.430" end="01:15:18.650">are seeing giving move from a transactional activity to more engaging we're seeing</p>
      <p begin="01:15:18.650" end="01:15:23.380">people be for more interactive informal social connecting collaborating</p>
      <p begin="01:15:23.380" end="01:15:27.800">about the causes that they care about the charities that are important to them?</p>
      <p begin="01:15:27.800" end="01:15:29.180">And, as I conclude</p>
      <p begin="01:15:29.180" end="01:15:33.370">...can't emphasize enough how much this how much of an impact this is</p>
      <p begin="01:15:33.370" end="01:15:38.180">going to have...really in a fantastic position because this platform has allowed us</p>

      <p begin="01:16:23.830" end="01:16:26.110">our platform innovation office.</p>
      <p begin="01:16:27.510" end="01:16:29.520">There are three core concepts.</p>

      <p begin="01:16:34.260" end="01:16:37.150">The first one is about the user experience.</p>
      <p begin="01:16:38.510" end="01:16:39.640">We're opening up</p>
      <p begin="01:16:39.640" end="01:16:44.900">the office user experience for all of your applications in fundamental</p>
      <p begin="01:16:44.900" end="01:16:49.800">ways so that your applications can show up in the context of what</p>
      <p begin="01:16:49.800" end="01:16:54.200">...billion plus users of office...in office create</p>
      <p begin="01:16:54.200" end="01:16:59.110">staff do get stuff done collaborate communicate we want</p>
      <p begin="01:16:59.110" end="01:17:03.610">you to be able to build applications that fit naturally into those context</p>
      <p begin="01:17:04.660" end="01:17:09.480">second we want to go beyond single applications their</p>
      <p begin="01:17:09.480" end="01:17:14.260">api in data silos to a semantically rich...</p>
      <p begin="01:17:14.260" end="01:17:17.750">of data that is available...you to be able to consume.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:18.780" end="01:17:24.070">As well as extent.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:24.070" end="01:17:28.810">We want to have the capability to reason over that</p>
      <p begin="01:17:28.810" end="01:17:33.660">...and...intelligence into your applications so that not only does</p>
      <p begin="01:17:33.660" end="01:17:36.830">it drive new features or more importantly</p>
      <p begin="01:17:36.830" end="01:17:41.360">...engagement in your applications so those are the tree</p>
      <p begin="01:17:41.360" end="01:17:46.340">concept that fundamentally change office so we want to give you a quick tour of that</p>
      <p begin="01:17:46.340" end="01:17:51.340">so that you can look at what your applications can do to exploit these capabilities and</p>
      <p begin="01:17:51.340" end="01:17:59.600">...for that I just want to interviews...from our officeteam to show you some of those I rob...</p>
      <p begin="01:17:59.600" end="01:18:02.460">So, how can we get started by talking about how</p>
      <p begin="01:18:02.460" end="01:18:06.800">we're moving from office from mas to office with</p>
      <p begin="01:18:06.800" end="01:18:11.670">partners that's great that's...write-in we're looking at here is word</p>
      <p begin="01:18:11.670" end="01:18:16.290">this is office sixteen when thirty-two what we see is a solution from</p>
      <p begin="01:18:16.290" end="01:18:20.660">...you sign scott was talking about them earlier they do digital signatures</p>
      <p begin="01:18:20.660" end="01:18:24.940">and they've integrated the our of their service directly and office using a</p>
      <p begin="01:18:24.940" end="01:18:29.450">...new modern web at in framework it's built on top of html five</p>
      <p begin="01:18:29.450" end="01:18:34.950">and javascript communicates the document through javascript object model let's switch gears and look</p>
      <p begin="01:18:34.950" end="01:18:39.820">at another one this is an add-in that we're building partnering with sap that makes it easy for</p>
      <p begin="01:18:39.820" end="01:18:44.420">me while I'm building a spreadsheet like my product inventory information to pull</p>
      <p begin="01:18:44.420" end="01:18:49.220">information directly from sap this is built on top of sap for gateway</p>
      <p begin="01:18:49.220" end="01:18:52.930">from microsoft when the great things about the new add-in framework is that</p>

      <p begin="01:20:55.740" end="01:21:00.050">we're showing here is...add-in from linkedin that makes it easy for me to do that it</p>

      <p begin="01:21:03.120" end="01:21:08.390">me directly in the context of my email so I don't have to leave the flow of how I'm doing my work</p>
      <p begin="01:21:08.390" end="01:21:13.280">we sales force has built a very similar thing that...from the to in cc line but also looks</p>
      <p begin="01:21:13.280" end="01:21:17.680">up the companies that are showing up on the mail thread so I get to see the people and</p>
      <p begin="01:21:17.680" end="01:21:21.520">...them...sales force but I can see the accounts and I can go right into the</p>
      <p begin="01:21:21.520" end="01:21:26.480">opportunities and take action from here within outlook without leaving the flow of my</p>
      <p begin="01:21:26.480" end="01:21:29.630">...it's been great to be working with the sales forcing because they're really</p>
      <p begin="01:21:29.630" end="01:21:35.090">...all of the extensions we have across the entire surface area of office</p>
      <p begin="01:21:35.090" end="01:21:38.140">ba and excel and outlook or in other</p>

      <p begin="01:21:42.680" end="01:21:47.430">...communications infrastructure that's fantastic dasi absolutely outlook is not</p>
      <p begin="01:21:47.430" end="01:21:51.490">just about mail outlook is also about my appointments in my calendar</p>
      <p begin="01:21:51.490" end="01:21:56.230">ing and it has all that information is structured way below the important things for me is not as</p>
      <p begin="01:21:56.230" end="01:22:01.410">being the meeting but getting there on time or partnering with over to build a solution that does exactly</p>
      <p begin="01:22:01.410" end="01:22:05.130">this so here's an ad in that...has built...I can set and</p>

      <p begin="01:22:09.870" end="01:22:15.950">as we switch over here to the iphone what I actually see is I've got a reminder for</p>
      <p begin="01:22:15.950" end="01:22:20.400">mover seeing slide to get a ride so I'll go ahead and do that it brings up</p>
      <p begin="01:22:20.400" end="01:22:24.550">huber and it's my pick-up location the cool thing is that</p>
      <p begin="01:22:24.550" end="01:22:29.050">it got my destination because that lived in outlook so outlook knew where I needed to be</p>
      <p begin="01:22:29.050" end="01:22:32.050">...huber knows where I need to go that's great so that</p>
      <p begin="01:22:32.050" end="01:22:36.820">shows you how applications that you...throughout office</p>
      <p begin="01:22:36.820" end="01:22:40.830">they extend beyond any single application now let's talk a little bit</p>
      <p begin="01:22:40.830" end="01:22:46.800">about this graph how are we...and exposing the grafted developers,</p>
      <p begin="01:22:46.800" end="01:22:51.720">yeah, that's actually pop it open and take a look at exactly what it looks like so this week</p>
      <p begin="01:22:51.720" end="01:22:55.360">at build we're announcing a preview of the unify</p>
      <p begin="01:22:55.360" end="01:23:00.120">api endpoint for office three sixty-five api is this builds on top of the</p>
      <p begin="01:23:00.120" end="01:23:04.660">file mail calendar workloads that we delivered last fall and what it does is make it</p>
      <p begin="01:23:04.660" end="01:23:09.420">easy for developers to get to this data in a unify consistent way so</p>
      <p begin="01:23:09.420" end="01:23:14.400">we just popping open a little api explorer tool that can show us what are some of those request</p>
      <p begin="01:23:14.400" end="01:23:19.310">and response patterns look like so what we use a developer have to do in order to get access to this</p>
      <p begin="01:23:19.310" end="01:23:22.640">rich data what you can see is the urls a pretty simple</p>
      <p begin="01:23:22.640" end="01:23:25.800">...dot microsoft dot com version number and the tenant that I</p>
      <p begin="01:23:25.800" end="01:23:29.710">and connecting to so make it easy for me in this example</p>
      <p begin="01:23:29.710" end="01:23:34.360">...query active directory together list of users I'm karen from users for a particular</p>
      <p begin="01:23:34.360" end="01:23:39.130">departments in this case operations what I get back is exactly what...expect</p>
      <p begin="01:23:39.130" end="01:23:43.930">clean well formatted easy-to-understand json every developer in the room has a</p>
      <p begin="01:23:43.930" end="01:23:48.820">whole toolkit that can parse this and use it to build great solutions but the point is</p>
      <p begin="01:23:48.820" end="01:23:52.940">that this is actually a graph so I can go from an individual user</p>
      <p begin="01:23:52.940" end="01:23:58.280">drill into their files all I have to do to get to the files from one drive for business is</p>
      <p begin="01:23:58.280" end="01:24:01.420">...lash files on the end of the url and from</p>
      <p begin="01:24:01.420" end="01:24:06.300">...data documents coming back from one drive these are just the files that the</p>
      <p begin="01:24:06.300" end="01:24:10.860">login user as permission is and that's the powerful concept which is you no longer are going</p>
      <p begin="01:24:10.860" end="01:24:15.800">to different applications for different data you're not going to active directory for users in groups and then</p>
      <p begin="01:24:15.800" end="01:24:19.120">two-one drive for files but you're able to traverse the entirety of the</p>
      <p begin="01:24:19.120" end="01:24:23.050">...with these api is exactly right in fact speaking of</p>
      <p begin="01:24:23.050" end="01:24:28.020">groups let's pull up another example office three sixty five has a new concept for unify</p>
      <p begin="01:24:28.020" end="01:24:32.510">modern group that brings together the people and the documents and conversations</p>
      <p begin="01:24:32.510" end="01:24:36.860">...that they're having and we're exposing that through the unify api so I can query</p>
      <p begin="01:24:36.860" end="01:24:41.690">the active directory for groups and I can navigate through them to find</p>
      <p begin="01:24:41.690" end="01:24:46.510">...files that belong to those group so here we actually see stick on a slaps files it brings</p>
      <p begin="01:24:46.510" end="01:24:51.510">up the files associate with that group again trims to the login user?</p>
      <p begin="01:24:51.510" end="01:24:56.730">Now this notion of login...a really common pattern for people building solutions so we've actually made</p>
      <p begin="01:24:56.730" end="01:25:01.590">it super easy there's a me token that you can stick in your url to just get back the data for the</p>
      <p begin="01:25:01.590" end="01:25:04.710">login use and that's probably very important because everything here is</p>
      <p begin="01:25:04.710" end="01:25:09.400">...through the policies and axles that you put into...so in some sense the</p>
      <p begin="01:25:09.400" end="01:25:14.340">...token gives you access for the user using the applications credentials exactly</p>
      <p begin="01:25:14.340" end="01:25:18.990">right and because now I have access to my information I can go and look at my</p>
      <p begin="01:25:18.990" end="01:25:23.270">calendar just slash events on the end of url and that brings back appointments that are</p>
      <p begin="01:25:23.270" end="01:25:26.850">...my outlook calendar and same idea to get to messages</p>
      <p begin="01:25:26.850" end="01:25:31.760">last messages and boom I'm in my inbox coming from exchange and it's just that easy</p>
      <p begin="01:25:31.760" end="01:25:36.290">awesome so how can we talk about the last concept which is how do we go</p>
      <p begin="01:25:36.290" end="01:25:41.080">from here to really building the...</p>
      <p begin="01:25:41.080" end="01:25:45.720">of intelligence inside of your applications sure so,</p>
      <p begin="01:25:45.720" end="01:25:50.540">this is powered by the office graphs and the thing about the office...is we talked about data</p>
      <p begin="01:25:50.540" end="01:25:55.170">we talked about...and we really talked about how we can use that to drive a whole</p>
      <p begin="01:25:55.170" end="01:25:58.090">other set of insights we know who are the people that</p>
      <p begin="01:25:58.090" end="01:26:02.910">conversations the meeting in the organizations what we can do with that is provide additional insights</p>
      <p begin="01:26:02.910" end="01:26:07.450">...they can use that in the preview here to query the...to get information out</p>
      <p begin="01:26:07.450" end="01:26:11.480">...addition were delivering a first party app in the shape of delved</p>
      <p begin="01:26:11.480" end="01:26:16.430">that actually provides me every day with information about what am I working on it helps me</p>
      <p begin="01:26:16.430" end="01:26:23.790">search in discover the content that my colleagues are using.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:23.790" end="01:26:27.850">There's something funny going on.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:27.850" end="01:26:30.950">Keep going overt.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:30.950" end="01:26:35.780">Ok, so, here I am looking at delves and, what I see is</p>
      <p begin="01:26:35.780" end="01:26:39.740">exactly what you'd expect some cards and contact...will help me stay up-to-date on</p>
      <p begin="01:26:39.740" end="01:26:44.630">what my colleagues are doing so I see and excel notebook that is coming...one drive</p>
      <p begin="01:26:44.630" end="01:26:49.490">the let's me see here's what my boss peltier some caped guys here's an attachment that lives</p>
      <p begin="01:26:49.490" end="01:26:53.980">in email but we've been working with partners to imagine what will it look</p>
      <p begin="01:26:53.980" end="01:26:58.850">like when we have additional third-party signals coming to the...how can they get into this</p>
      <p begin="01:26:58.850" end="01:27:02.550">notification stream what we see here are opportunities so</p>
      <p begin="01:27:02.550" end="01:27:06.440">that's a card from sales force and that's exactly right this is a carven sales were showing the</p>
      <p begin="01:27:06.440" end="01:27:11.240">amount showing information about moans account etc I can navigate down</p>
      <p begin="01:27:11.240" end="01:27:16.360">here's information coming from twitter and believe that we see information coming from</p>
      <p begin="01:27:16.360" end="01:27:20.850">...people are collaborating boards I can navigate directly through and get to thatand,</p>
      <p begin="01:27:20.850" end="01:27:24.900">let's actually scroll down a little bit further and what we see is a purchase order coming from</p>
      <p begin="01:27:24.900" end="01:27:29.870">dynamics ax that looks like a super important one so it was...delve made easy for me to take</p>
      <p begin="01:27:29.870" end="01:27:34.720">action on it right so this is no longer now information that is inside of the office</p>
      <p begin="01:27:34.720" end="01:27:39.170">...that's based on the data of our apps but people are able to extend the</p>
      <p begin="01:27:39.170" end="01:27:43.380">graph with additional edges and nodes that's all surfacing</p>
      <p begin="01:27:43.380" end="01:27:54.060">in doubt that's exactly right wonderful thank you so much ranking very much?</p>
      <p begin="01:27:54.060" end="01:27:58.990">That gives you a flavor for how offices fundamentally changing in fact there's one other</p>
      <p begin="01:27:58.990" end="01:28:03.770">sdk that we're launching in addition to the office graph which is what</p>
      <p begin="01:28:03.770" end="01:28:08.470">web sdk for skylight where the presence information where the ability to</p>
      <p begin="01:28:08.470" end="01:28:13.090">embed...side of your applications video chat and messaging is</p>
      <p begin="01:28:13.090" end="01:28:18.310">now possible so you can build a web app mobile app using sky presence information</p>
      <p begin="01:28:18.310" end="01:28:23.280">...embedded inside of your apps this fundamental change.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:23.280" end="01:28:29.070">That we're making...this fundamental platform shift of office</p>
      <p begin="01:28:29.070" end="01:28:33.720">where the users the one billion plus users of office are available for you is</p>
      <p begin="01:28:33.720" end="01:28:38.300">developers the semantically rich graph that is available for you to consume</p>
      <p begin="01:28:38.300" end="01:28:41.820">...extend and to drive additional engagement</p>
      <p begin="01:28:41.820" end="01:28:46.650">through intelligence we believe is going to change the very fundamental nature of</p>
      <p begin="01:28:46.650" end="01:28:50.530">what office is to becoming really a platform</p>
      <p begin="01:28:50.530" end="01:28:54.150">...from us and from you together.</p>

      <p begin="02:01:39.750" end="02:01:44.470">enhance the windows user experience so that end-users on</p>
      <p begin="02:01:44.470" end="02:01:48.610">lots and lots of devices but in particular I'm going to focus on the pc how</p>
      <p begin="02:01:48.610" end="02:01:51.400">end-users will be able to discover</p>
      <p begin="02:01:51.400" end="02:01:56.350">and engage with all of the apps that you and we right we know</p>
      <p begin="02:01:56.350" end="02:02:01.250">that great technology for building apps is just part of the story you need users to engage</p>
      <p begin="02:02:01.250" end="02:02:06.170">with them so I want to show you some of the work we're doing that's going to make that possible and...I'm going to wrap up with one more</p>
      <p begin="02:02:06.170" end="02:02:11.170">cool demo of how the universal windows platform enables new devices</p>
      <p begin="02:02:11.170" end="02:02:17.480">and new kinds of actions on devices so let me just jump right in and get started so,</p>
      <p begin="02:02:17.480" end="02:02:22.050">I have here a very recent build of windows ten for the pc and I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="02:02:22.050" end="02:02:26.700">begin on the start menu I want to show you some of the work we've been doing to continue to</p>
      <p begin="02:02:26.700" end="02:02:31.610">tweak the design and improve the visuals in the interaction</p>
      <p begin="02:02:31.610" end="02:02:36.480">so you'll see what I've got here we think is pretty close to what we expect to have</p>
      <p begin="02:02:36.480" end="02:02:41.460">when we're done although of course we're going to continue to take feedback from our insiders you'll notice</p>
      <p begin="02:02:41.460" end="02:02:46.160">there's new beautiful live tile animations that helped draw people's</p>
      <p begin="02:02:46.160" end="02:02:51.030">attention to the apps and the app data for the things that they've pinned</p>
      <p begin="02:02:51.030" end="02:02:55.150">you'll notice we've clean the layout up a bit for those of you insiders who</p>
      <p begin="02:02:55.150" end="02:02:58.550">kind of surprised us with your enthusiasm for windows</p>
      <p begin="02:02:58.550" end="02:03:03.130">...aero glass you'll notice the translucent see here's the blur</p>
      <p begin="02:03:03.130" end="02:03:07.300">effect that you saw...windows seven so we're trying to bring some of that field back</p>
      <p begin="02:03:07.300" end="02:03:12.120">we've got the most used apps here we're putting file explore settings our all apps</p>
      <p begin="02:03:12.120" end="02:03:16.650">at the bottom were bringing jump lists back in so you can see here's file explore with</p>
      <p begin="02:03:16.650" end="02:03:21.090">jump listen this work for other apps as well thank you?</p>
      <p begin="02:03:21.090" end="02:03:23.100">But, the thing I wanted sort of focus on a little bit</p>
      <p begin="02:03:23.100" end="02:03:27.470">is this space right here where in this case I have an installed and app for a</p>
      <p begin="02:03:27.470" end="02:03:32.180">little while so the system is going to give us a smart suggestion</p>
      <p begin="02:03:32.180" end="02:03:37.330">for app in the store that is going to be one that suitable for me as I'm using my</p>
      <p begin="02:03:37.330" end="02:03:41.830">pc on the client we know which apps your launching and which apps your installing</p>
      <p begin="02:03:41.830" end="02:03:46.590">...so we're able to communicate with the store and bring down suggestions that are personalize for</p>
      <p begin="02:03:46.590" end="02:03:51.560">you to help users learn about great new apps that are available for them to trout</p>
      <p begin="02:03:51.560" end="02:03:54.300">...their pc and as time goes by we</p>
      <p begin="02:03:54.300" end="02:03:58.460">...that space in a smart way to help script the</p>
      <p begin="02:03:58.460" end="02:04:03.090">users discovery of apps first but then...engagement later so five</p>
      <p begin="02:04:03.090" end="02:04:08.070">installed and app as you see here for a little while that space becomes the recently</p>
      <p begin="02:04:08.070" end="02:04:12.300">installed out the user confine the app they can revisit and if they use it</p>
      <p begin="02:04:12.300" end="02:04:17.040">enough it'll move its way up into the most used section automatically of course at</p>
      <p begin="02:04:17.040" end="02:04:21.890">any time the user can drag from left to right to take any of those apps and pin them as</p>
      <p begin="02:04:21.890" end="02:04:26.760">full live tiles so think of this as the users lifecycle of discovery</p>
      <p begin="02:04:26.760" end="02:04:32.630">and engagement and re-use which we're trying to script right into the start menu?</p>
      <p begin="02:04:32.630" end="02:04:36.600">There's a whole other area that users are engaging with for we want to</p>

      <p begin="02:18:56.400" end="02:19:00.250">more valuable to end-users in general we have a</p>
      <p begin="02:19:00.250" end="02:19:05.030">vision an idea that the windows platform and apps written for it should</p>
      <p begin="02:19:05.030" end="02:19:09.970">be able to flex to different screen sizes and different input methods not by</p>

      <p begin="02:19:27.050" end="02:19:31.860">is evolving and I want to show you some of the ways that your apps can light up a</p>
      <p begin="02:19:31.860" end="02:19:37.500">great continuum experience I'm going to start with eight-inch tablet this is a lenovo thinkpad</p>
      <p begin="02:19:37.500" end="02:19:43.120">it's running...full windows it's got intel compatible part and the first thing you</p>
      <p begin="02:19:43.120" end="02:19:47.920">might notice of course I'm going to use this in tablet...you're looking at tablet...but for those of you</p>
      <p begin="02:19:47.920" end="02:19:51.140">paid attention closely and especially if you've given us feedback</p>
      <p begin="02:19:51.140" end="02:19:53.690">...start in tablet</p>
      <p begin="02:19:53.690" end="02:19:58.660">mode we've simplified here we've made the live tiles bigger this looks very familiar to windows</p>
      <p begin="02:19:58.660" end="02:20:02.620">eight users and the extra stuff you're most use list your</p>
      <p begin="02:20:02.620" end="02:20:05.790">sign in things like file explore settings the</p>

      <p begin="02:20:10.110" end="02:20:14.830">...showed nicely in this list we now have jumped lists working in here</p>
      <p begin="02:20:14.830" end="02:20:19.700">in a nice way with animation so on so it's really easy for me to navigate</p>
      <p begin="02:20:19.700" end="02:20:24.900">around my apps of course down here in the tips the system tasks which</p>
      <p begin="02:20:24.900" end="02:20:30.220">are I've got my task switching button which I can use to switch between lots of apps here's</p>

      <p begin="02:20:35.070" end="02:20:40.010">...jump into maps and do some navigation in the maps app here and I want to show you how</p>
      <p begin="02:20:40.010" end="02:20:44.900">this will scale to of more full pc like experience so,</p>

      <p begin="02:21:02.910" end="02:21:06.470">...now what I'm going to do I want you to think about me using this</p>
      <p begin="02:21:06.470" end="02:21:11.300">...a very natural touch friendly way but now since...pc</p>
      <p begin="02:21:11.300" end="02:21:16.130">...bring it back to my...I'm just going to docket in here and when I do I want you</p>
      <p begin="02:21:16.130" end="02:21:18.790">to notice how the maps app</p>
      <p begin="02:21:18.790" end="02:21:23.570">experience changes to adapt the panel that was on the bottom when I</p>
      <p begin="02:21:23.570" end="02:21:28.540">...portrait mode is now on the left side and in fact when I,</p>
      <p begin="02:21:28.540" end="02:21:33.540">you know, restore this window I've now got my excel I've got my powerpoint</p>
      <p begin="02:21:33.540" end="02:21:37.950">all here running in a familiar way with windows that I can minimize</p>
      <p begin="02:21:37.950" end="02:21:42.880">and restore in pc mode so that's an example of continuum really helping me flex</p>
      <p begin="02:21:42.880" end="02:21:47.370">on a small tablet the next example I want to show you that's new is here on</p>
      <p begin="02:21:47.370" end="02:21:52.520">this surface pro three where I have a rich complex...app</p>
      <p begin="02:21:52.520" end="02:21:57.680">...is otto desks...it's a high-end heavily used</p>
      <p begin="02:21:57.680" end="02:22:02.420">very popular three-d authoring out and, you know, if you notice the you I've got lots of tool</p>
      <p begin="02:22:02.420" end="02:22:06.660">...and...down here I've got the timeline or...might edit animation</p>
      <p begin="02:22:06.660" end="02:22:11.720">of my three-d character but imagine I'm an artist so I might use this docked with</p>
      <p begin="02:22:11.720" end="02:22:15.760">the big-screen keyboard mouse might use it like this but sometimes I'm going to remove</p>
      <p begin="02:22:15.760" end="02:22:20.500">the keyboard entirely and use it like a tablet and in this case here's...within thirty</p>
      <p begin="02:22:20.500" end="02:22:24.710">...app responding to that change in state in the system...adapting its</p>
      <p begin="02:22:24.710" end="02:22:27.930">...and now I can use touch or I could use the</p>
      <p begin="02:22:27.930" end="02:22:32.520">pen to be able to do things like mark-up right on the character maybe</p>
      <p begin="02:22:32.520" end="02:22:37.220">it maybe I'm now going to be in this note where in this mode where I want take notes for people</p>
      <p begin="02:22:37.220" end="02:22:42.060">...might team share my thoughts on the character the app flex is to take</p>
      <p begin="02:22:42.060" end="02:22:47.130">advantage of the use of the pen and touch as opposed to mouse and keyboard</p>
      <p begin="02:22:47.130" end="02:22:55.170">...that case using when thirty-two now I have one last thing I want to show thank you?</p>
      <p begin="02:22:55.170" end="02:22:58.930">I have one last thing I want to show so far we've shown this continuum</p>
      <p begin="02:22:58.930" end="02:23:03.640">feature working with our shell and with apps on the pc and watching the pc</p>
      <p begin="02:23:03.640" end="02:23:08.650">device flex across these form factors but we have a vision that not only the</p>
      <p begin="02:23:08.650" end="02:23:13.040">pc can benefit from flexibility and use of input devices</p>
      <p begin="02:23:13.040" end="02:23:16.870">and screen sizes so to can the phone so today</p>
      <p begin="02:23:16.870" end="02:23:20.580">we're excited to show for the first-time continuum for</p>
      <p begin="02:23:20.580" end="02:23:24.960">phones built into windows ten so let me give you look at how that</p>
      <p begin="02:23:24.960" end="02:23:30.110">works so over here I have...I should point out we need new hardware for this</p>
      <p begin="02:23:30.110" end="02:23:35.070">and I don't have that hardware working today fact we're going to try demo of that a session on</p>
      <p begin="02:23:35.070" end="02:23:41.620">thursday so you're seeing a simulation I'm going to do is connect my phone and.</p>
      <p begin="02:23:41.620" end="02:23:44.420">Let's see you get this going.</p>
      <p begin="02:23:44.420" end="02:23:49.030">Once I connect my phone I want you to think of this I've got a bluetooth keyboard a bluetooth</p>
      <p begin="02:23:49.030" end="02:23:53.610">mouse and a screen just a screen that I'm connecting via html</p>
      <p begin="02:23:53.610" end="02:23:58.570">I okay so because this phone software has all the core component tree that's</p>
      <p begin="02:23:58.570" end="02:24:03.750">highly shared between the pc things like bluetooth keyboarding mice their supported and,</p>
      <p begin="02:24:03.750" end="02:24:09.010">you might notice I'm not sure if the...shows this but at the top of my phone screen now it says</p>
      <p begin="02:24:09.010" end="02:24:13.790">...for mouse and keyboard controller I could tap that then get essentially a mouse pad on</p>
      <p begin="02:24:13.790" end="02:24:17.950">my phone but I don't need to do that because I have a full bluetooth mouse and</p>
      <p begin="02:24:17.950" end="02:24:22.690">keyboard right here up here on the monitor you'll notice this looks very familiar I mean</p>
      <p begin="02:24:22.690" end="02:24:27.380">...the same start menu with tiles I had my phone now displayed like a start</p>
      <p begin="02:24:27.380" end="02:24:30.580">menu and I want to start running apps to give you a sense of how</p>
      <p begin="02:24:30.580" end="02:24:35.220">well the phone experience transforms through continuum to give you a very</p>
      <p begin="02:24:35.220" end="02:24:37.480">pc like experience...</p>
      <p begin="02:24:37.480" end="02:24:43.070">launch powerpoint this is the version of powerpoint that comes with the phone and,</p>
      <p begin="02:24:43.070" end="02:24:47.480">what you see on the big-screen here sure looks like the version of powerpoint that you would see</p>
      <p begin="02:24:47.480" end="02:24:51.580">on a pc because in fact it is the same code as the version</p>
      <p begin="02:24:51.580" end="02:24:54.260">of powerpoint that you would download from the store and see</p>
      <p begin="02:24:54.260" end="02:24:59.120">on a pc I can do things like use my mouse and keyboard to create a new slide</p>
      <p begin="02:24:59.120" end="02:25:03.060">...up here use the ribbon to insert pictures remember this</p>
      <p begin="02:25:03.060" end="02:25:08.010">is my phone so as I am inserting the photos I bring up my photos this is the</p>
      <p begin="02:25:08.010" end="02:25:12.730">calmer role of my phone and the...photos that I've synched from one drive</p>
      <p begin="02:25:12.730" end="02:25:17.250">...choose...appropriate desert picture from a trip I made to utah and</p>
      <p begin="02:25:17.250" end="02:25:19.960">I'll insert that into my powerpoint presentation</p>
      <p begin="02:25:19.960" end="02:25:23.480">...completely natural and familiar way using the keyboard</p>
      <p begin="02:25:23.480" end="02:25:28.290">...mouse let's look at some other examples...the click here to go into male</p>
      <p begin="02:25:28.290" end="02:25:32.400">and the outlook mail client that comes with windows ten pc's</p>
      <p begin="02:25:32.400" end="02:25:36.820">...comes with phone's is now viewed and it looks completely familiar here's my</p>
      <p begin="02:25:36.820" end="02:25:40.250">mail folders I can choose a message in my inbox and</p>
      <p begin="02:25:40.250" end="02:25:45.050">...click the reply button where I have the full our of the word engine</p>
      <p begin="02:25:45.050" end="02:25:50.310">embedded righted outlook for doing replies and there's the familiar ribbon you can see here and,</p>
      <p begin="02:25:50.310" end="02:25:54.020">is asking me to update the latest expense report eric's going to give me the</p>
