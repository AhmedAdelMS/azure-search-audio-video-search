      <p begin="00:01:03.280" end="00:01:08.330">...that build and at the last-minute two weeks ago joseph</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.330" end="00:01:13.690">...mean to doing the presentation...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.690" end="00:01:19.900">I figured fear would do something fun this time around so, we're</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.900" end="00:01:23.910">...talk about that now of course before we can we can get the fun part</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.910" end="00:01:28.860">which should give some background for those of you that the know what,... the want to get some of the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:28.860" end="00:01:33.770">context so when the today we're going to show you now built end-to-end it was a very</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.770" end="00:01:37.850">...it took us two weeks to build two weeks we finished last</p>
      <p begin="00:01:37.850" end="00:01:42.730">night and out maybe a little bit this morning at two am ...a</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.730" end="00:01:47.290">...when nicholas friday...perfect gotten...and honestly,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:47.290" end="00:01:52.940">honestly it was finish limit earlier but...testing the app we ended up consuming</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.940" end="00:01:57.890">all over free asher credits so we have...the last night figure out how to move it out from my personal</p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.890" end="00:02:02.660">account...some...yeah, so, post-production we didn't really think this through</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.660" end="00:02:08.480">what anyways...about that today so...talk a lot about the same...platform and this is</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.480" end="00:02:13.270">where designing developing and integrating are love and passion for csharp and dot</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.270" end="00:02:18.470">net across ios android...all the windows platforms as well and,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.470" end="00:02:21.670">we focus a lot and this is this were in visual studio using</p>
      <p begin="00:02:21.670" end="00:02:26.790">...designers using our favorite libraries and explore all this as well as there is actually a lot more than</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.790" end="00:02:31.040">...the gal talked about that we're going to show you everything in our platform last time</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:35.760">egl came and spoke at build we had a...just launching for the first-time</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:40.660">...some brand-new exciting things since last build for instance it's not just about</p>
      <p begin="00:02:40.660" end="00:02:43.620">designing developing application about test</p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.620" end="00:02:48.160">abilities wow that's where the zimmer new...tasks zimmer task cloud come in</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.160" end="00:02:53.310">you build automated csharp scripts or really scripts the tester ios</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.310" end="00:02:56.890">...android applications with...was amr or not we</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.890" end="00:03:01.050">also think also what happens after you ship your application what happens when this free</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.050" end="00:03:05.810">...credits go down up and make sure that you can monitor application for</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.810" end="00:03:09.010">...analytics but also crash reporting and focus on</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.010" end="00:03:11.480">...insights for any of your applications</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.480" end="00:03:16.460">...windows ios android but also I point out that we actually did usability</p>
      <p begin="00:03:16.460" end="00:03:21.140">testing was a short period compress creative usability testing but we learn a couple of interesting</p>
      <p begin="00:03:21.140" end="00:03:24.570">less yes, we'll talk about that later and we have</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.570" end="00:03:29.020">...amazing platform to learn all this as well which I'll talk about the...university with live interactive</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29.020" end="00:03:36.550">instructor so this is...your complete mobile...anything you want to do in mobile.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.550" end="00:03:41.460">I think examine why iphone over the for year-ago four years ago when I moved to seattle</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.460" end="00:03:44.470">to take a job is the solow mobile developers small</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.470" end="00:03:48.550">...they tell me hey you got to...back</p>
      <p begin="00:03:48.550" end="00:03:53.430">then that two weeks to build and ios android...windows phone an windows store application and demo</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.430" end="00:03:57.190">at cs said okay...to two-month plenty of time</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.190" end="00:04:02.040">...doing that two weeks because able to build-up my shared csharp back-end everything a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02.040" end="00:04:05.500">...view models sequel databases wrestle service calls and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:05.500" end="00:04:08.440">...beautiful user interface for ios android and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:08.440" end="00:04:12.680">of course windows but this application we built now done a lot of things that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.680" end="00:04:16.080">...game programming printer software.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:16.080" end="00:04:21.580">Because everyone's got...right printer software for about four years right so the idea that...expert today and we'll get into the idea</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21.580" end="00:04:26.410">...actually contained heavy dose of server a work not only</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.410" end="00:04:30.630">a heavy does of server work but a lot of interesting problems that we're not familiar with</p>
      <p begin="00:04:30.630" end="00:04:33.790">...the project two weeks ago I mean we...the articles</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33.790" end="00:04:39.450">and url this stuff on the internet's but you don't really know what you're doing until you're doing so</p>
      <p begin="00:04:39.450" end="00:04:44.610">what was interesting this time around is not only that we shared it csharp</p>
      <p begin="00:04:44.610" end="00:04:49.550">lodging between the ui but also we ended up sharing a bunch of code</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.550" end="00:04:54.590">with the server right and right now I runs and asher...we're hoping to put...also on one</p>
      <p begin="00:04:54.590" end="00:04:59.820">...running and of course...running linux we end up actually sharing code between</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.820" end="00:05:04.440">the client-server and have some data their has the first-time I ever did...I was amaze just has a</p>
      <p begin="00:05:04.440" end="00:05:09.050">...library boom just shared because we tend to be client people we</p>
      <p begin="00:05:09.050" end="00:05:12.370">...and this time around to pull them up together we had</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12.370" end="00:05:17.010">to do end-to-end so we learn entity framework ...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:17.010" end="00:05:22.290">jobs we use send grid we used service...service...because this is web scale</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.290" end="00:05:26.320">...up push notifications for google klout messing adrg notification</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:30.180">...in really tying entire you check boxes down it's like all</p>
      <p begin="00:05:30.180" end="00:05:34.780">the services to bring a great story together not only was fun but also give me an excuse to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.780" end="00:05:41.700">...every meeting from my boss...I had I got to get more meetings the right so</p>
      <p begin="00:05:41.700" end="00:05:46.710">this is roughly what we explained last year you share csharp code but,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:46.710" end="00:05:51.810">you have these...pieces of code that are specific to each platform you get</p>
      <p begin="00:05:51.810" end="00:05:56.040">some idea specific go to have abolished experience and idealize abolish experience</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56.040" end="00:06:00.480">and android abolished experience on windows each are now some of you</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.480" end="00:06:05.260">...not necessarily need every bit of polish last year when should...can...the next</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.260" end="00:06:07.570">...wimp...an api</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.570" end="00:06:12.390">cause I'm informs which is an api that essentially gives you a way of describing the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:12.390" end="00:06:15.660">...a high-level enable wrong</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.660" end="00:06:19.780">with native controls on every platform and, what we build can</p>
      <p begin="00:06:19.780" end="00:06:24.430">...put this together two days we don't have time to show today but</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24.430" end="00:06:29.270">we did also build a companion administration up for...what we're going to...today and it's</p>
      <p begin="00:06:29.270" end="00:06:35.920">hundred-percent code sharing now I said csharp everywhere but the reality</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.920" end="00:06:41.100">is that everything that you can do that csharp you can also we would have...I'm a big of...fan but,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.100" end="00:06:42.760">it's often difficult to put in</p>
      <p begin="00:06:42.760" end="00:06:48.850">...I want-to make sure you guys now you can use both of them?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:48.850" end="00:06:52.930">And, the way that we're doing this for those of you that are not familiar it's</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.540" end="00:06:57.690">...developer you're familiar with all these namespaces and all</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57.690" end="00:07:03.390">these api that exists here right up and there's a class of</p>
      <p begin="00:07:03.390" end="00:07:07.660">api is the boxing blue that are you why specific api</p>
      <p begin="00:07:07.660" end="00:07:14.130">...particular are windows api for the new platform but, in the past was windows forms</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.130" end="00:07:18.950">...was wpf or maybe even a speedup net but these are presentation layer api</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.950" end="00:07:20.690">zer operating systems specific</p>
      <p begin="00:07:20.690" end="00:07:24.750">api so the way that you have to think about how to build applications for andrea now</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.750" end="00:07:29.600">us everything in...something that you can...works everywhere or everything that you can get</p>
      <p begin="00:07:29.600" end="00:07:35.040">enough people new jay and, when you go to...essentially have to use a different set of</p>
      <p begin="00:07:35.040" end="00:07:39.630">api what is essentially the same thing you have to learn a new model for the ui a new</p>
      <p begin="00:07:39.630" end="00:07:44.350">model for notifications and things like that and the same thing it's repeated again with</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44.350" end="00:07:49.640">android but essentially now you can think you can immediately see how you could structure and application</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.640" end="00:07:55.770">to be cross-platform how you structure...code to work in this way how do I switch</p>
      <p begin="00:07:55.770" end="00:07:58.990">the next one which one is just right...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:00.410" end="00:08:05.580">So, what is important approach...taking is that we're projecting the android...the ios</p>
      <p begin="00:08:05.580" end="00:08:10.320">api or the macape as we're really talked much about it but we project all of these</p>
      <p begin="00:08:10.320" end="00:08:14.580">api into csharp so you can consume the same set everything that you could</p>
      <p begin="00:08:14.580" end="00:08:19.210">...some from swift objectives your java you can consumes from csharp so you're never at</p>
      <p begin="00:08:19.210" end="00:08:24.340">...disadvantage if you want to learn how to build an application from the ground-up</p>
      <p begin="00:08:24.340" end="00:08:28.580">using this model and also get one of the school csharp shirts the gentleman here</p>
      <p begin="00:08:28.580" end="00:08:31.310">in the front is using or there was a gentleman with the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:31.310" end="00:08:36.290">...somewhere a nice...red and yellow I</p>
      <p begin="00:08:36.290" end="00:08:40.040">...you can download this application...when you download the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:40.040" end="00:08:48.270">application and run it you can actuallyget the shirt...get an idea of how it structured?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:48.270" end="00:08:49.380">So, this is how it started.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:50.440" end="00:08:55.210">At two weeks ago ...I'm going to...onstage and I said</p>
      <p begin="00:08:55.210" end="00:08:58.180">...app ideas are the conversations lab.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:00.430" end="00:09:04.600">And, now the problem is that it's a crowded space.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:04.600" end="00:09:07.550">Right so we're going to build...map we don't want...to be a throw-away apple</p>
      <p begin="00:09:07.550" end="00:09:13.700">...this to be an application that will sustain ...this but that's</p>
      <p begin="00:09:13.700" end="00:09:18.700">the time the test of time,... something that I...open up every single-day and use want to create a real-time</p>
      <p begin="00:09:18.700" end="00:09:23.320">communication application that was fun in new will be</p>
      <p begin="00:09:23.320" end="00:09:27.840">an amazing demo but also something that we can actually put out there but like</p>
      <p begin="00:09:27.840" end="00:09:32.270">...goss a huge...space we are multiple...plant check klein's on our</p>
      <p begin="00:09:32.270" end="00:09:37.110">phones already has all these different services are doing different things and that was something that</p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.110" end="00:09:39.800">...can we do different right so what we do</p>
      <p begin="00:09:39.800" end="00:09:44.710">well luckily for us hbo just published silicon valley</p>
      <p begin="00:09:44.710" end="00:09:49.800">...first full season and hbo now on the daily baconthat we can load it</p>
      <p begin="00:09:49.800" end="00:09:54.460">up we bench watch the can valley and we have...we actually came up with</p>
      <p begin="00:09:54.460" end="00:10:00.470">a couple of lessons how to build successful startups so we're going to share experience with you guys.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:00.470" end="00:10:03.090">Measure experience what and all of this who</p>
      <p begin="00:10:03.090" end="00:10:07.270">...binge watching come up with this plan execute</p>
      <p begin="00:10:07.270" end="00:10:11.280">deliver them onstage...and we tested and we...hit and we</p>
      <p begin="00:10:11.280" end="00:10:17.120">did usability testing so here are the parameters and this is what we learn from</p>
      <p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:21.530">the silicon valley so we learn a lot of lessons I want to...those with you so you can go back home</p>
      <p begin="00:10:21.530" end="00:10:27.390">...your companies so first thing...want to find a large market and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:27.390" end="00:10:30.280">often work focus...maybe we can, you know,</p>

      <p begin="00:24:06.610" end="00:24:12.510">Or now but the idea the following idea the idea...I learned it wellthe idea of the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:12.510" end="00:24:17.280">ibm model is that you splinter application in the part that</p>
      <p begin="00:24:17.280" end="00:24:21.860">...the stores the information that's typically the model and on the other end of</p>

      <p begin="00:24:30.980" end="00:24:34.680">I've kind of fun to build this application because we would add a feature,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:34.680" end="00:24:37.600">for example,...without a feature to android he would put</p>
      <p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:42.740">...model on his view and the next morning ...them that was working</p>
      <p begin="00:24:42.740" end="00:24:46.830">...the I'll just pick it up and fill in and it was very nice to see how</p>
      <p begin="00:24:46.830" end="00:24:50.300">...was being developed very rapidly and all of the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:50.300" end="00:24:55.010">logical of the data mining and information was shared so the ui when we have</p>

      <p begin="00:24:58.940" end="00:25:04.090">that's very interesting I remember getting on the slack in the morning and have a conversation...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:04.090" end="00:25:06.840">is overseas and I said...going to...this page I</p>

      <p begin="00:25:32.570" end="00:25:35.720">...actually pull down into some of these methods</p>
      <p begin="00:25:35.720" end="00:25:41.730">for instance let me go ahead and say pick photo for here...the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:41.730" end="00:25:46.060">logic for picking and uploading the actual photo and taking the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:46.060" end="00:25:48.570">photos all in shared code?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:48.570" end="00:25:52.760">Since...developers we can abstract away all the hard bits of ios...android and</p>
      <p begin="00:25:52.760" end="00:25:57.190">create a common interface to say take a photo asynchronous</p>

      <p begin="00:26:14.270" end="00:26:18.110">and then of course we're building out the user interfaces inside a visual studio...our</p>
      <p begin="00:26:18.110" end="00:26:22.980">story board designers you can see it is pretty, pretty nicely laid out very large we can</p>
      <p begin="00:26:22.980" end="00:26:26.910">dive in when you go in you can actually come in and modify any of the properties</p>

      <p begin="00:26:46.620" end="00:26:50.790">...we can see here the different cells that were creating and filling in the ui</p>
      <p begin="00:26:50.790" end="00:26:56.580">...the code behind of course the same thing is true for android application but instead of using a story</p>
      <p begin="00:26:56.580" end="00:27:00.460">board we have android xml files which are very much like</p>
      <p begin="00:27:00.460" end="00:27:04.630">xhtml files but just without data mining...very much the same we</p>

      <p begin="00:27:19.970" end="00:27:24.690">...what that's doing behind the hood is generating all the android xml for me to</p>
      <p begin="00:27:24.690" end="00:27:29.360">actually get this here...I really love about the structure this code is that</p>
      <p begin="00:27:29.360" end="00:27:34.040">in the code behind for instance if I diamond let's say my profile</p>
      <p begin="00:27:34.040" end="00:27:38.890">fragment there's really not that much code what I'm doing here is I'm just having a</p>
      <p begin="00:27:38.890" end="00:27:44.410">little, little...whenever I click the avatar I just call-in and say would you like to pick a photo</p>
      <p begin="00:27:44.410" end="00:27:48.560">...a photo and I call out to my view model...a photo take a photo and the rest is</p>
      <p begin="00:27:48.560" end="00:27:52.360">handle format automatically most of it is just setting up the user interface and</p>
      <p begin="00:27:52.360" end="00:27:58.440">we can see here down the bottom...property change notifications so whenever I</p>

      <p begin="00:28:07.720" end="00:28:13.270">bulk shared code is now automatically scaled...a bug</p>
      <p begin="00:28:13.270" end="00:28:17.670">in one product you simply fix it righted unit tests around it and now it's</p>
      <p begin="00:28:17.670" end="00:28:21.260">good to go and I think there's a couple of interesting things we also built</p>
      <p begin="00:28:21.260" end="00:28:23.370">that consul version so we could test</p>
      <p begin="00:28:23.370" end="00:28:29.780">...easily from the consul for unix...we do like that we also have here the watch</p>
      <p begin="00:28:29.780" end="00:28:32.790">get application so that's the one that just show you a second ago</p>

      <p begin="00:28:40.070" end="00:28:45.350">And, the last the last row there at the end is...is...we're sharing with the server which we have a</p>
      <p begin="00:28:45.350" end="00:28:52.140">separate solution because we're developing in parallel but, that's where all the shared coded so this is the</p>

      <p begin="00:29:07.710" end="00:29:12.860">yeah, and, the server codes the server code is here as well and we see down here we have the apple watch</p>
      <p begin="00:29:12.860" end="00:29:17.330">kids but also the server client...the shared code and that shared across everything</p>

      <p begin="00:36:07.610" end="00:36:10.210">What happened to this thing so go?</p>

      <p begin="00:36:24.940" end="00:36:29.970">what I might have been debugging I might have been actually inspecting the app itself</p>
      <p begin="00:36:32.060" end="00:36:37.040">so, images resize this...the...I just want to not have to do this in front of you it's a</p>

      <p begin="00:36:51.990" end="00:36:56.200">so I think that we have a couple of nice the features here because this is not really running</p>

      <p begin="00:37:57.350" end="00:38:02.640">...the images...are variable selected view...I can explore some of the properties on that thing,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:05.500">for example, the frame...to tell me</p>
      <p begin="00:38:05.500" end="00:38:09.830">...the position right now I can say selected view?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09.830" end="00:38:11.750">And, I know that say image view I can say</p>
      <p begin="00:38:11.750" end="00:38:18.960">the e match can be the broadly so now I can change the broccoli life.</p>

      <p begin="00:38:22.010" end="00:38:27.280">Let me show you a little bit ...limit different this actually shows one of the problems that</p>
      <p begin="00:38:27.280" end="00:38:34.280">we had here so we have these label here it's overloading chopped we have a little...there so</p>
      <p begin="00:38:34.280" end="00:38:39.240">...like this thing but the problem that this is actually...view made about</p>
      <p begin="00:38:39.240" end="00:38:44.340">ton of other little things so when I tried selected such little bit obnoxious...it's a...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:44.340" end="00:38:54.330">so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go here I'm going to fetch a three-d view of the.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:54.330" end="00:38:58.720">So, I'm going to like the view that I one...that you can see how it's getting composer I'm going to select that</p>
      <p begin="00:38:58.720" end="00:39:01.750">...and now selected...I'm going to say what is that well</p>
      <p begin="00:39:01.750" end="00:39:05.890">...it's a is what I want?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:05.890" end="00:39:09.900">...I don't think that's one let me get this poppy I think it's</p>
      <p begin="00:39:09.900" end="00:39:17.110">the little guy ok let me go there and it's a label so I can say</p>
      <p begin="00:39:17.110" end="00:39:23.100">I think that it's a large number right so one of the things that I could do is now, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:23.100" end="00:39:27.560">could should...I could just said this like adjust font-size to fit with...</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.560" end="00:39:33.070">and ios property this is not something I did for them is just...as property and,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:33.070" end="00:39:37.050">that's affecting the box they can go customize it see what's wrong and,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:37.050" end="00:39:41.620">in fact I could just have done that directly from here right I could have just selected</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.620" end="00:39:47.440">...element and it's a little difficult now that I have that I don't have a big display</p>
      <p begin="00:39:47.440" end="00:39:52.270">here to play with but you can just go here and see what the properties are what is going on with your</p>
      <p begin="00:39:52.270" end="00:39:56.100">compare with your component right so?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:56.100" end="00:39:59.230">...go back so like that because I think...selected something else now</p>
      <p begin="00:40:00.560" end="00:40:06.750">let me so like the this little guy here and.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:06.750" end="00:40:14.650">And, now we can go back.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:14.650" end="00:40:19.000">...can see that this is a problem again right might text nys being left the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:19.000" end="00:40:24.090">...so I can just right here text alignment people</p>
      <p begin="00:40:24.090" end="00:40:28.910">ui text align mend dot center.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:28.910" end="00:40:32.600">And, there goes so all of these are actually</p>
      <p begin="00:40:32.600" end="00:40:37.330">ios property is running on the target process so you can explore all the properties change</p>
      <p begin="00:40:37.330" end="00:40:43.080">...properties say what is going on we're adding support for monitoring network</p>
      <p begin="00:40:43.080" end="00:40:46.600">...and other things as extra taps and,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:46.600" end="00:40:50.600">it's we're going to make it available as a new get a as a new j</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.600" end="00:40:55.900">...so that so, that you can actually very easily added</p>
      <p begin="00:40:55.900" end="00:40:59.730">to any application so the distribution of the software will be a new j that you can</p>
      <p begin="00:40:59.730" end="00:41:03.060">...the knows that comes with the app you can run it and then and,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03.060" end="00:41:07.560">you can start inspecting now the other thing I just wanted to do because I'm trying to send</p>
      <p begin="00:41:07.560" end="00:41:09.590">a subliminal message to my daughter.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:11.000" end="00:41:18.270">Is I want pick this collection view here so let me see selected</p>
      <p begin="00:41:18.270" end="00:41:26.960">That background...what I want I want...background color and we pick maybe.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:26.960" end="00:41:30.180">Maybe this one so what we have here.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:30.180" end="00:41:33.080">Selected view.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:33.080" end="00:41:36.960">Background color so I can say you...from</p>

      <p begin="00:41:42.940" end="00:41:50.550">...I thought that ...I could do that if you're...some points so.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:50.550" end="00:41:53.350">So, let's go back to...slides so,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:53.350" end="00:41:57.260">that's our summer inspector and you'll be able to able to use it to</p>

      <p begin="00:42:04.580" end="00:42:08.720">The next challenges right so we got a great application and now we</p>
      <p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:13.210">...to deliver a great experience everywhere right we want-to make sure that our kids get the</p>

      <p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:22.690">set up until three again can get there can get everything running so?</p>
      <p begin="00:42:22.690" end="00:42:29.140">We've been shown at all on really...devices...pop in...the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:29.140" end="00:42:33.840">...six lots of on six-plus naturally gotta have it was interesting is</p>
      <p begin="00:42:33.840" end="00:42:38.990">when I was a kid uniting get the latest and greatest technology at all now is wanted it but I was</p>
      <p begin="00:42:38.990" end="00:42:41.640">in a way a little bit...coming...kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:42:41.640" end="00:42:47.070">trickle-down a little bit right and what happens is this right when you look at the android market and,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:47.070" end="00:42:52.290">we know that...fragmentation...problem but when you look at the...market we got</p>
      <p begin="00:42:52.290" end="00:42:56.690">these dating from google a couple of nights ago but this is roughly</p>
      <p begin="00:42:56.690" end="00:43:01.060">what the market is for parents right we got a bunch of people</p>
      <p begin="00:43:01.060" end="00:43:06.300">...got some people in jelly bean ice cream sanded...for you and...</p>
      <p begin="00:43:06.300" end="00:43:11.280">we're thinking about parents this is okay but the reality is that</p>
      <p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:15.910">the is that kids don't really...really get the latest device right</p>
      <p begin="00:43:15.910" end="00:43:19.970">...a new device comes out this is roughly what happens?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:19.970" end="00:43:21.760">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:21.760" end="00:43:26.050">The one percent of the children of the one percent we'll certainly get the five percent</p>
      <p begin="00:43:26.050" end="00:43:30.290">the five a lowly bob but what happens is that the...basically give</p>
      <p begin="00:43:30.290" end="00:43:34.660">...all devices to your children right so you end up with this so,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:34.660" end="00:43:39.410">you end up with...where it's actually very important support things like gingerbread or ice cream sandwich</p>
      <p begin="00:43:39.410" end="00:43:44.650">...be all devices but and I'm not giving you know, my two-year-old toddler a</p>
      <p begin="00:43:44.650" end="00:43:48.920">...six-plus I'm going to give him the iphone three-g as that is still running around</p>

      <p begin="00:47:34.030" end="00:47:38.920">kick at jelly bean etc we took that same task those running local we</p>
      <p begin="00:47:38.920" end="00:47:43.490">...kinder chat for android right here in this...task cloud...a few different tasks</p>
      <p begin="00:47:43.490" end="00:47:46.960">...we actually found some very glaring issues we ran for different</p>
      <p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:51.490">tasks for changing friends passwords switching we see that we have a task that's failing on</p>
      <p begin="00:47:51.490" end="00:47:56.850">ten different devices what was actually...is that when we started this things that...so choked</p>
      <p begin="00:47:56.850" end="00:48:02.460">as club...to find a way of making these fail we actually have to do that because</p>
      <p begin="00:48:02.460" end="00:48:05.760">...road that's when it turns out that we did have a failure and</p>
      <p begin="00:48:05.760" end="00:48:11.130">natural failure so this is we're going to show you a natural fehler that occurred when we're building it</p>
      <p begin="00:48:11.130" end="00:48:15.640">exactly so here is the application running on here this is a successful romy you can see</p>
      <p begin="00:48:15.640" end="00:48:20.610">...running on eighty plus different devices and go into any single device get a</p>
      <p begin="00:48:20.610" end="00:48:24.120">full screenshot snapshot of it so I can upload that later get</p>
      <p begin="00:48:24.120" end="00:48:29.060">council logs along the way of anything that's happening on...device...go back</p>
      <p begin="00:48:29.060" end="00:48:33.840">so here for instance I could actually just navigate down and I get updates</p>
      <p begin="00:48:33.840" end="00:48:38.890">...every step that happened the same steps that you saw happening locally you can see them</p>
      <p begin="00:48:38.890" end="00:48:43.580">...execute and all these devices but this one was interesting we actually ran into a few</p>
      <p begin="00:48:43.580" end="00:48:48.350">issues right off the bat with actually just smaller really form factors are trying to open the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:48.350" end="00:48:53.060">...but here for instance I login I'm so like the user</p>
      <p begin="00:48:53.060" end="00:48:57.930">and this all seems good I send a message the message was sent so we can see</p>
      <p begin="00:48:57.930" end="00:49:02.660">actually on the...side over here I...make sure that I can go back to the main messaging</p>
      <p begin="00:49:02.660" end="00:49:07.640">page so in this command I'm actually taping this button right here the back button or the up</p>
      <p begin="00:49:07.640" end="00:49:12.660">arrow if you will so when I taped that we can see that are actually fails?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:12.660" end="00:49:16.160">On all these top row devices what's really intriguing is that</p>
      <p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:20.910">it was failing to go back on all of our ice cream sandwich devices I</p>
      <p begin="00:49:20.910" end="00:49:25.550">...some bad functionality and api that didn't exist and it was crashing the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:25.550" end="00:49:30.410">application they couldn't continue on now the rest of the devices that were successful to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:30.410" end="00:49:34.970">go through that step go here and now I can diamond get more information about</p>
      <p begin="00:49:34.970" end="00:49:40.460">the specific tasks failures what was going on obviously here there's nothing there but we can see that</p>
      <p begin="00:49:40.460" end="00:49:46.600">...go back groups skips the one of these.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:46.600" end="00:49:49.950">Was failing and get the snapshot I can see the test failures that</p>
      <p begin="00:49:49.950" end="00:49:52.810">were going on as well here.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:52.810" end="00:49:56.020">Is really powerful and this is...actually solve that problem this which a little bit</p>
      <p begin="00:49:56.020" end="00:49:59.740">...logic as well so that's the our of</p>
      <p begin="00:49:59.740" end="00:50:04.140">writing user interface scripts user interface ship into the task that has</p>
      <p begin="00:50:04.140" end="00:50:08.910">on devices but then we actually shipped...right we actually</p>
      <p begin="00:50:08.910" end="00:50:14.770">...chandra first beta thing we were crying and monday and</p>
      <p begin="00:50:14.770" end="00:50:15.780">...started</p>
      <p begin="00:50:15.780" end="00:50:20.110">...problems...and we sort of capturing those so we're using them</p>
      <p begin="00:50:20.110" end="00:50:25.280">and insights which is a lot it's a framework that allows you to log exceptions</p>
      <p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:29.960">...exceptions errors or send analytics about what's happening</p>
      <p begin="00:50:29.960" end="00:50:34.980">your application so what we had originally added things for the sake of examining what was</p>
      <p begin="00:50:34.980" end="00:50:38.830">happening with the application we also got caption all the crashes so we're going to show you how</p>
      <p begin="00:50:38.830" end="00:50:41.720">...capture here and let me actually show you how easy it was</p>
      <p begin="00:50:41.720" end="00:50:47.120">set up and running so inside of my main application added a new get packages all this new</p>
      <p begin="00:50:47.120" end="00:50:52.320">...so here...have an initialize...android application same thing over here</p>
      <p begin="00:50:52.320" end="00:50:56.130">...and insights and then my shared code is a portable class</p>
      <p begin="00:50:56.130" end="00:51:01.130">library so everything up inside of my share library high</p>
      <p begin="00:51:01.130" end="00:51:03.430">divx indy here and go to my helpers?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:04.460" end="00:51:07.390">Services there we go I have a longer utility pyro some of</p>
      <p begin="00:51:07.390" end="00:51:10.570">these that I track report different exceptions I can even</p>
      <p begin="00:51:10.570" end="00:51:14.440">...time so...interesting here is that we got connection we have</p>
      <p begin="00:51:14.440" end="00:51:17.690">our dashboard and this is interesting we see something horrible</p>
      <p begin="00:51:17.690" end="00:51:21.800">happened here about seven eight thousand warnings and</p>
      <p begin="00:51:21.800" end="00:51:24.930">...crashes and what's interesting is energy</p>
      <p begin="00:51:24.930" end="00:51:27.370">see crashes report over time so these are session</p>
      <p begin="00:51:27.370" end="00:51:32.130">...of how many sessions are occurring in the application compared to the crashes so this</p>
      <p begin="00:51:32.130" end="00:51:36.460">actually pretty good...early development crashes and we...things early on we got a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:51:36.460" end="00:51:40.610">of users in but we had a lot of warnings...reporting as well</p>
      <p begin="00:51:40.610" end="00:51:44.920">...actually going to mike how we can see that I'm actually just have a bunch of...exceptions because</p>
      <p begin="00:51:44.920" end="00:51:49.840">...server went down a full stack trace of a rich stack trace like a message our trying to send</p>
      <p begin="00:51:49.840" end="00:51:53.760">a message was linear all my different device information this was happening on</p>
      <p begin="00:51:53.760" end="00:51:57.700">...for instance but let me go into this is rash and this</p>
      <p begin="00:51:57.700" end="00:52:00.180">crashes what happened yesterday right,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:00.180" end="00:52:03.390">...were crying and one of these personal...means</p>
      <p begin="00:52:03.390" end="00:52:06.930">...has its own set of measure machines we have a bunch of those but it</p>
      <p begin="00:52:06.930" end="00:52:11.730">...that we just had started developing...form personal accounts so we run</p>
      <p begin="00:52:11.730" end="00:52:16.540">out of credit on that one so this crashes are actually was running out of credit on the as</p>
      <p begin="00:52:16.540" end="00:52:23.140">...machines exactly what...really...how...was...forgot some different</p>
      <p begin="00:52:23.140" end="00:52:27.700">so has some debug in there that was actually setting some different properties so when I went</p>
      <p begin="00:52:27.700" end="00:52:33.510">to production actually for...to take those flags out I got...we see here I fixed...push</p>
      <p begin="00:52:33.510" end="00:52:36.780">...new version and some people didn't update so blame them</p>
      <p begin="00:52:36.780" end="00:52:41.290">...come in and say that this is close and...reports back additionally here</p>
      <p begin="00:52:41.290" end="00:52:45.880">we can see all the different users that are coming...as all anonymous data that's coming and we can track the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:45.880" end="00:52:49.640">different sessions that are occurring in the applications starting the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:49.640" end="00:52:54.190">arguments the different messages that are coming back from the server and...sort...here</p>
      <p begin="00:52:54.190" end="00:52:59.020">now what we're doing here what is important is that you can see...application starts and when it gets sent</p>
      <p begin="00:52:59.020" end="00:53:03.930">to the background and resume essentially have a history of what happened with your application as yet</p>
      <p begin="00:53:03.930" end="00:53:07.640">insights the application you can see what was the workflow that might have led to</p>
      <p begin="00:53:07.640" end="00:53:12.880">a crash or might have led to a particular condition in the application exactly right it's a</p>
      <p begin="00:53:12.880" end="00:53:17.200">...a it's a little it helps you with the archaeology of a bug of course we</p>
      <p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:21.890">...some different events so here we can see the average time for uploading avatars you should</p>
      <p begin="00:53:21.890" end="00:53:24.780">parallelism into...into this right here?</p>
      <p begin="00:53:26.690" end="00:53:31.480">...so actually get nice daily events back and forth ascending messages how often</p>
      <p begin="00:53:31.480" end="00:53:34.640">...people sending messages we can see that...lot...here and then the</p>
      <p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:39.330">servers went down and I was no good and then we came back up and you can really see this is, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:39.330" end="00:53:42.440">this is exactly when we put it in just over a little week ago...having</p>
      <p begin="00:53:42.440" end="00:53:47.350">...here as well so how long did it take to actually save a profile back to the server</p>
      <p begin="00:53:47.350" end="00:53:50.190">upload...photo or search for a friend inside</p>
      <p begin="00:53:50.190" end="00:53:55.600">...one was the last time it occured this is really important because if I introduce new app</p>
      <p begin="00:53:55.600" end="00:54:00.620">logic into here that was searching for a friend and actually broke</p>
      <p begin="00:54:00.620" end="00:54:05.750">...cn when I push...new update now everything's taking longer something go back and...that we saw</p>
      <p begin="00:54:05.750" end="00:54:10.100">some interesting things is what you...different statistics</p>
      <p begin="00:54:10.100" end="00:54:14.920">avenir as well as you can add additional attribute such as maybe popular user names the avatars you</p>
      <p begin="00:54:14.920" end="00:54:19.960">select different themes right now and I in fact I think with the theme we figure out...the beginning which</p>
      <p begin="00:54:19.960" end="00:54:24.960">...label that said pinker blow at what we immediately discover is that</p>
      <p begin="00:54:24.960" end="00:54:29.460">are toddler audience was not ready to read pinker blue so once we change that</p>
      <p begin="00:54:29.460" end="00:54:33.840">...or blue collars it became very obvious very simple the to pick-up</p>
      <p begin="00:54:33.840" end="00:54:35.020">exactly,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:35.020" end="00:54:39.990">exactly so you see this shift overtime and actually using this analytics to improve the</p>
      <p begin="00:54:39.990" end="00:54:44.740">application at the same time getting the manage and native crash reports...that single-line</p>
      <p begin="00:54:44.740" end="00:54:49.790">...code you have just initialize you get all your manage and native crashes right there,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:49.790" end="00:54:54.140">yeah, I think the other piece that we learned that ponders can really use a messaging application</p>
      <p begin="00:54:54.140" end="00:54:59.090">of the result was on distinguishable from the encrypted version</p>
      <p begin="00:54:59.090" end="00:55:00.720">...so we gotta go we're going</p>
