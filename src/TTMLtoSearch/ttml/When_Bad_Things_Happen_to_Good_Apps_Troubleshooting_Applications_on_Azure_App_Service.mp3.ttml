      <p begin="00:00:32.130" end="00:00:35.320">first of all my name is...sheI'm a program manager larger</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.320" end="00:00:41.310">app service theme I focus on building features from a bats the...spend the</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.310" end="00:00:46.070">...my career with microsoft the working as a support...so I've seen the</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.070" end="00:00:51.380">...customers go through when things don't work out very well and the one of the things that</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.380" end="00:00:56.330">I decided when I took this job to try and do things where?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.330" end="00:01:01.450">I can help improve the situations for the scenarios where you have deploy the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.450" end="00:01:04.530">sites...productions running full-blown and something's</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.530" end="00:01:09.340">bads happening right and now you really want to find out what's going on what can I do</p>
      <p begin="00:01:09.340" end="00:01:14.300">troubleshooting and things along those lines because the tons and tons of solutions out there that basically go</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.300" end="00:01:19.900">and say no I'm going to give you alerting...this...for-you I'll let, you know, when something goes wrong</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.900" end="00:01:24.470">...you get a phone call you get a pager what's next right that's one stop people,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.470" end="00:01:30.090">people start usually freaking out the pages loading slow of what to do next?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.090" end="00:01:34.350">So, what we've done here and...with the...web app service?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.350" end="00:01:38.800">Is an attend the to try and automate the diagnostics to a</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.800" end="00:01:40.070">point?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.070" end="00:01:41.630">Where we can start?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.630" end="00:01:43.770">Trying to give you a snapshot of what is happening in</p>
      <p begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:48.690">...production site at any given time along the side with the prescriptive</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.690" end="00:01:54.780">guidance on what we think is going draw because most of the time for the developer you don't have</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.780" end="00:01:58.800">to...what...and how to fix it you just telling what has been screwed up</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.800" end="00:02:03.920">and he or she knows what to fix it right so that said we're?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.920" end="00:02:07.620">Going-to go ahead...the start this session.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.620" end="00:02:15.160">...this you guys know the usual drill ...and submit the valve there because it helps improve.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.160" end="00:02:21.170">the agenda basically for this and the key take away I want you guys to go away from there has to understand</p>
      <p begin="00:02:21.170" end="00:02:26.070">the tools and the best practices available to trouble shoot either web apps roger websites</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.070" end="00:02:30.330">or apps of is focusing on the performance and availability</p>
      <p begin="00:02:30.330" end="00:02:34.540">...and the reason it's very important because the larger ad services</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.680" end="00:02:39.610">...fully manage fast solution where we don't allow you to artie p don't</p>

      <p begin="00:03:00.500" end="00:03:05.040">...what could possibly go wrong...see all the situations are different kinds of issues we try and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:08.160">...and...issues before we</p>
      <p begin="00:03:08.160" end="00:03:12.710">start diving into how to use and tools because it's important to understand what kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.710" end="00:03:17.530">issue your seen before you start using different tools...and you don't really don't use</p>
      <p begin="00:03:17.530" end="00:03:22.840">this sledgehammer to try and put enable the to fans and things along those lines</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.840" end="00:03:25.430">...will to the tools that are available</p>
      <p begin="00:03:25.430" end="00:03:31.120">...and lots of demos in a demo I'm going to start with the something very simple</p>
      <p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:35.480">...to how you start peeling the orleans-and fill in the final demos we'll start</p>
      <p begin="00:03:35.480" end="00:03:40.000">look into some really, really advanced of...see how we can...helping so we should</p>
      <p begin="00:03:40.000" end="00:03:46.370">live performance the issues with websites it's not going to be like I'm going to</p>

      <p begin="00:03:51.050" end="00:03:55.330">...show you what do you do in a situation when all those</p>
      <p begin="00:03:55.330" end="00:04:02.080">known tools available to you don't work...take a lot of questions hopefully we'll have enough time for them.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02.080" end="00:04:05.260">So, what could possibly go wrong right?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:05.260" end="00:04:08.540">It's...always a question on everyone's mind when you're</p>

      <p begin="00:05:57.520" end="00:06:01.750">In the next and both of...on the floor right so this is how we turn out to be</p>
      <p begin="00:06:01.750" end="00:06:04.530">...in that situation I...is very</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.530" end="00:06:09.190">the similar to how we do development and how we do a job development start</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.190" end="00:06:14.160">pushing things into production and things along those lines right at the industry astra what</p>

      <p begin="00:06:19.110" end="00:06:22.830">such a nice-guy of able web app I give...too much sugar that's what causes</p>
      <p begin="00:06:22.830" end="00:06:28.050">...if I were to ask the same question to the victim's mother she's going to know</p>

      <p begin="00:06:38.020" end="00:06:42.520">make them sit together for the picture right so it's all different perspective and how you how</p>
      <p begin="00:06:42.520" end="00:06:46.150">...troubleshooting things...put things into perspective right so it's very</p>
      <p begin="00:06:46.150" end="00:06:50.980">important the to understand the type of the issue before we start jumping of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.980" end="00:06:56.970">...into the...so every time you call into micros</p>
      <p begin="00:06:56.970" end="00:06:59.690">...any live service support or any company</p>
      <p begin="00:06:59.690" end="00:07:04.490">...at highly at high-level there are three different kinds of issues that we go through right so here,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:04.490" end="00:07:07.590">you know, you perform...got a problem right?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:07.590" end="00:07:11.640">First one is the most easy one it's a generic advocacy right or you want</p>
      <p begin="00:07:11.640" end="00:07:16.160">to do something like subscription migration I want to move my acid from the subscript another one there's no</p>
      <p begin="00:07:16.160" end="00:07:20.600">low-impact everything's happy it pick up the phone is...man how are you how's the weather</p>
      <p begin="00:07:20.600" end="00:07:27.940">...to do this everything answer very happy most the time right.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:27.940" end="00:07:32.390">The second one is you notice something crazy happening with website you</p>
      <p begin="00:07:32.390" end="00:07:37.150">go like hey man this is weird in a...to do about this so you pick up a</p>
      <p begin="00:07:37.150" end="00:07:41.710">phone...support and you report...with incident right</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.710" end="00:07:46.100">and this category has two kinds of issues the first one.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:46.100" end="00:07:50.430">Is usually...issue but it's very difficult to isolate is an application issue</p>
      <p begin="00:07:50.430" end="00:07:56.300">or a platform but right so you basically go through a whole cycle of working with the...trying to get the data try and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:56.300" end="00:08:01.510">...at the end of the where's my day...to fix this right and...cycles</p>
      <p begin="00:08:01.510" end="00:08:06.870">...brand...back...specific...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.870" end="00:08:11.020">The other category here you repeat the whole cycle you call you go through process</p>
      <p begin="00:08:11.020" end="00:08:15.390">...the support that tells you what we found out there's a bug in the platform</p>
      <p begin="00:08:15.390" end="00:08:20.300">is impacting you maybe tens of other customers the entire services not dom</p>
      <p begin="00:08:20.300" end="00:08:26.420">and then customer usually goes like a...suffix...going to ship it and things on those lines.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.420" end="00:08:28.030">This is the second caddy that you see...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:28.030" end="00:08:33.000">the major is the majority of the issues that support or any service usually goes through.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:33.000" end="00:08:36.620">The third in the big one is my god there's a platform</p>
      <p begin="00:08:36.620" end="00:08:41.460">...and usually the my god is coming from the service...itself is not the...usually</p>
      <p begin="00:08:41.460" end="00:08:46.310">the customer because we have tons and tons of allergic and monitoring place where we</p>
      <p begin="00:08:46.310" end="00:08:50.890">...sites there's a canary siphoning every single gm will try and see what the response time</p>
      <p begin="00:08:50.890" end="00:08:55.320">is and the...and things along those lines we get the alert and we start freaking out when we get</p>
      <p begin="00:08:55.320" end="00:08:59.120">dealer from any given stampa region and have...engineers up and</p>
      <p begin="00:08:59.120" end="00:09:04.420">running usually doesn't come from customer but there are situations where this might be</p>
      <p begin="00:09:04.420" end="00:09:09.610">...from customer because our monitoring catching nobody's, nobody's perfect and that's a learning process</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.610" end="00:09:16.090">we can we try and incorporate that into a learning process this...category there</p>
      <p begin="00:09:16.090" end="00:09:21.000">isn't much you as a customer can do to actually resolve the issue in</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.000" end="00:09:25.010">most cases you're basically at the mercy of service owner to try and fix</p>
      <p begin="00:09:25.010" end="00:09:29.630">issued all you need at that point...just tell me what's going on how long as going-to-take to fix</p>
      <p begin="00:09:29.630" end="00:09:33.330">the issue and there's that?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.330" end="00:09:37.140">Let's core what causes usually the platform issues</p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.140" end="00:09:43.360">...specific dodger apps services because were built very uniquely write-in like</p>
      <p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:47.960">...likes to say right he when he talks about these two different compute</p>
      <p begin="00:09:47.960" end="00:09:51.700">...in all I as is like a building your own house.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:51.700" end="00:09:54.740">Has like a renting the house?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:54.740" end="00:09:57.750">And, app service of the sites it's more like</p>
      <p begin="00:09:57.750" end="00:10:01.960">a ranking luxury hotel right I mean basically everything...for use...using</p>
      <p begin="00:10:01.960" end="00:10:06.830">it you'll get and things along those lines so when we build this large results always</p>
      <p begin="00:10:06.830" end="00:10:11.560">been and basically using all the core services like...equalizer</p>

      <p begin="00:36:48.690" end="00:36:55.620">often but they should have kicked off the session here for phd it's done and php</p>

      <p begin="00:37:09.240" end="00:37:13.110">...all-out is insane so we in-flight basically grab the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:13.110" end="00:37:16.920">snapshot of the process and run the analyzer almost php and build</p>
      <p begin="00:37:16.920" end="00:37:22.000">...right so let's see if this guy caught...</p>

      <p begin="00:55:55.200" end="00:55:57.560">...it works.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:57.560" end="00:56:00.270">The...get sense out...my servicing team</p>
      <p begin="00:56:00.270" end="00:56:07.260">...people who are actually monitoring the service whatnot in a little bit you'll see that here the</p>
      <p begin="00:56:07.260" end="00:56:10.110">And, there are a bunch of people monitoring it...reply</p>
      <p begin="00:56:10.110" end="00:56:14.960">are basically start working on the issue right away...available replies...five ten minutes</p>
      <p begin="00:56:14.960" end="00:56:20.970">and to see if anybody wants to see and...so let me see go back here but, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:20.970" end="00:56:25.310">that one way to report issue and, you know, we take that very seriously the services you will work on</p>
      <p begin="00:56:25.310" end="00:56:29.890">it right away but if somebody asked me...I code this...and we're going to nicely tell you</p>
      <p begin="00:56:31.090" end="00:56:36.110">...you work on that and part of to make the work.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:36.110" end="00:56:40.920">So, I think, you know, I have covered the majority of the scenarios that I want to talk about there's more</p>
      <p begin="00:56:40.920" end="00:56:43.180">...building but at this point in</p>
      <p begin="00:56:43.180" end="00:56:46.920">...me just go back and make sure there's no more slight.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:46.920" end="00:56:51.690">Yet there's an...brow than the we recommend...please give us feedback tell us what you like to see</p>
      <p begin="00:56:51.690" end="00:56:58.500">will like to build that...whenever possible in a does that.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:03.790" end="00:57:05.100">Yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:05.100" end="00:57:23.750">I'll repeat the question.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:23.750" end="00:57:27.390">Next question the question is sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:27.390" end="00:57:30.860">...excellent question the question was how does this diagnosis</p>
      <p begin="00:57:30.860" end="00:57:34.370">servicecompare against things like app inside and things along those lines</p>
      <p begin="00:57:34.370" end="00:57:38.920">...the app inside it basically something that you work into.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:38.920" end="00:57:42.950">This basically on the other its...app insight right.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:42.950" end="00:57:46.490">Not every customer will have app inside or any of that</p>
      <p begin="00:57:46.490" end="00:57:52.330">the instrumentation running for the code from giggle even officially might not be completely</p>
      <p begin="00:57:52.330" end="00:57:59.770">...truly optimized to basically capture all different situations...try to solve here is this</p>
      <p begin="00:57:59.770" end="00:58:04.550">there's one very specific situation for everything's running...a production and you want to have</p>
      <p begin="00:58:04.550" end="00:58:09.630">a very lightweight snapshot of what is exactly...without installing any tools without</p>
      <p begin="00:58:09.630" end="00:58:14.750">...any the tracing anything...your the application just to</p>
      <p begin="00:58:14.750" end="00:58:19.020">go at that specific time right so the app inside and everything works great</p>
      <p begin="00:58:19.020" end="00:58:23.590">on the p the zen the profiling everything works create when you</p>
      <p begin="00:58:23.590" end="00:58:28.820">tuna part request atroubleshooting and trying to find out what the...is</p>
      <p begin="00:58:28.820" end="00:58:33.670">request and things along those lines the perfect question is how does work with multi the</p>
      <p begin="00:58:33.670" end="00:58:37.950">...applications and we're trying to solve that one by one because what this does</p>
      <p begin="00:58:37.950" end="00:58:43.310">...gives you snapshot of a web processes it ted culture to a point that if you're stuck on</p>
      <p begin="00:58:43.310" end="00:58:47.260">top of database will say I'm making a...to database and I'm waiting to get</p>
      <p begin="00:58:47.260" end="00:58:52.050">response back you will not tell you what exactly is wrong at this point on</p>
      <p begin="00:58:52.050" end="00:58:55.880">...database on your query we try to solve that step by taking</p>
      <p begin="00:58:55.880" end="00:58:59.830">a further collaboration with the clear...that you saw where they have</p>
      <p begin="00:58:59.830" end="00:59:04.310">...diagnosis epa recall that does a connection test that does that tell you how many</p>
      <p begin="00:59:04.310" end="00:59:08.650">connections open if anyone nation what not so the...information but we rely on</p>
      <p begin="00:59:08.650" end="00:59:15.350">all the other environment to basically help us participate into this.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:15.350" end="00:59:36.400">This project eventually have the full end-to-end the solutions like...optimal.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:36.400" end="00:59:41.250">Now...at this is basically whatever's on the machine that you taken to take a</p>
      <p begin="00:59:41.250" end="00:59:45.110">...if it happens I...the agent rights and the scripting on</p>
      <p begin="00:59:45.110" end="00:59:52.780">a client-side browser and then get the data and then instrument from this on oct.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:52.780" end="00:59:59.330">...and revolving.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:59.330" end="01:00:04.050">That's correct...the all the other absolutes that are all then are basically using the same platform right so</p>
      <p begin="01:00:04.050" end="01:00:08.590">they what like I said aboutbriefly touch to a point that this these framework</p>
      <p begin="01:00:08.590" end="01:00:14.180">is extensible today if you have an application...application you...your own</p>
      <p begin="01:00:14.180" end="01:00:19.300">locks and, you know, what exactly...to do with the law if some error happen in the log you can</p>
      <p begin="01:00:19.300" end="01:00:24.140">want to tell your client do xyz you just write the collector you...the parser you</p>
      <p begin="01:00:24.140" end="01:00:30.430">uploaded...I don't have a us to show how...can be file and you are part of the system now right so now</p>
      <p begin="01:00:30.430" end="01:00:34.420">...basically participating in this framework in the all you have to decide the collector,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:34.420" end="01:00:38.840">you know, where you log one, you know, what the engine log means write the collector write the partial</p>
      <p begin="01:00:38.840" end="01:00:42.310">...report and you can pretty much plug-and-play in this?</p>
      <p begin="01:00:42.310" end="01:00:47.130">...every mobile app or anybody else, you know,...able eventually they want to the can</p>
      <p begin="01:00:47.130" end="01:00:53.550">part participate into it right a node collector node parser there's nothing stopping you from doing that.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:53.550" end="01:00:56.750">And, then you can take advantage of this auto healing triggers that we talked about and</p>
      <p begin="01:00:56.750" end="01:01:04.880">then trigger your analyzers and collector instead of the one that I in the box.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:04.880" end="01:01:07.590">Hra questions thanks.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:07.590" end="01:01:10.430">All right thanks lawson moi.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:24.160" end="01:01:28.320">So, it's a good question the question was the...holding rule that I was setting up do they go instead of a</p>
      <p begin="01:01:28.320" end="01:01:29.770">...the answer</p>
      <p begin="01:01:29.770" end="01:01:34.530">is no actually previously when we didn't have the ux via large you to put those rules</p>
      <p begin="01:01:34.530" end="01:01:39.200">...other convict when you do this from the ux it goes inside the application</p>
      <p begin="01:01:39.200" end="01:01:44.230">...can pick file so if you...said the role using the ux and also set one with the</p>
      <p begin="01:01:44.230" end="01:01:49.690">...the one in the web configures going-to-take the president's right so this actually large</p>
      <p begin="01:01:49.690" end="01:01:51.910">...flexibility of running multiple</p>
      <p begin="01:01:51.910" end="01:01:55.700">custom actions today with arguing if you were just in a web</p>
      <p begin="01:01:55.700" end="01:02:00.290">...app is you can only on one custom action for multiple triggers but now you can</p>
      <p begin="01:02:00.290" end="01:02:05.410">...few triggers and...matching apples and the one that's important you</p>
      <p begin="01:02:05.410" end="01:02:10.300">can have...web convicts and algal monitor both of them and you get a flexibility of doing more advanced</p>
      <p begin="01:02:10.300" end="01:02:12.710">...if you need to moi.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:20.660" end="01:02:24.730">...the question...do does clue work with the are back the answer to is today</p>
      <p begin="01:02:24.730" end="01:02:28.090">...you need to be aside administrator to log on to the</p>
      <p begin="01:02:28.090" end="01:02:33.120">...the to perform xyz but like I said this feature that we building</p>
      <p begin="01:02:33.120" end="01:02:36.330">...to called the...a prototype is an preview but</p>
      <p begin="01:02:36.330" end="01:02:39.300">...eventually move this into portal and when we do that the</p>
      <p begin="01:02:39.300" end="01:02:49.920">our backs scenario will command and where you allow people to do this for the...</p>
      <p begin="01:02:49.920" end="01:03:06.450">Sorry can you please repeat the question.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:06.450" end="01:03:10.550">Excellent question so yes there are there are api...available and I'll show you the</p>
      <p begin="01:03:10.550" end="01:03:14.340">command-line available for certain scenarios especially for the as one of</p>
      <p begin="01:03:14.340" end="01:03:18.450">the diagnostics ones so if I go to see.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:18.450" end="01:03:21.820">The mitigate in the...</p>
      <p begin="01:03:21.820" end="01:03:27.370">Will...my blog...the talks about the command-line...that is available right now I include</p>
      <p begin="01:03:27.370" end="01:03:31.140">...for bunch of api things that you can do restarting the process and calling things</p>
      <p begin="01:03:31.140" end="01:03:35.460">along those lines but here there's a canal...that you can do use and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="01:03:35.460" end="01:03:39.550">and, that's what I've been using for custom action in custom actually would choose to run...only</p>
      <p begin="01:03:39.550" end="01:03:46.500">...if you lighted...something that we prebuilt...</p>
      <p begin="01:03:46.500" end="01:03:51.530">All right cool thanks thank you.</p>
