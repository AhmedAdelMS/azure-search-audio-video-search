      <p begin="00:00:08.420" end="00:00:12.190">We hope you're having a great time in san francisco.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.190" end="00:00:14.160">Thanks for attending build.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.160" end="00:00:17.540">And, welcome to the...session.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.540" end="00:00:23.850">Can we see a show of hands how many of you have work with media capture before?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.850" end="00:00:25.070">Great.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.070" end="00:00:29.650">Know-how many of you have submitted a camera app to the store.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.650" end="00:00:34.990">To see some of you and we're here to get more of you onboard.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.990" end="00:00:37.020">And, this session will show you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.260" end="00:00:43.060">...how easy it is to develop powerful camera apps</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.060" end="00:00:46.700">for windows term.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.700" end="00:00:52.520">Mike will join us later in the session.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.520" end="00:00:57.430">I want to remind you that would be great to have your feedback once you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.430" end="00:01:05.880">are session is done please don't forget about that.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.880" end="00:01:10.540">As you heard in the keynote and various other sessions convergence of api</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.540" end="00:01:15.340">is across various device form factors is a key theme this year.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.340" end="00:01:17.500">You can now build your app once.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.500" end="00:01:20.980">And, run it on all your windows devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:20.980" end="00:01:21.450">Will begin</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.450" end="00:01:27.810">by covering some of the new functionality that you can leverage starting with windows down?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.810" end="00:01:31.520">And, in order to get you started easily we have</p>
      <p begin="00:01:31.520" end="00:01:33.970">some great universal windows platform samples.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:40.820">That michael walk us through later in the session.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.820" end="00:01:42.530">As part of convergence where</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.530" end="00:01:47.370">combine the functionality of windows media capture also known as wm</p>
      <p begin="00:01:47.370" end="00:01:51.580">see and windows phone media capture also known as w</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.580" end="00:01:55.070">pm see into w mc.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.220" end="00:02:00.990">So, features that are only available for...device form factor</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.990" end="00:02:07.470">of now available across all windows devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.470" end="00:02:10.800">For example, video stabilization comes from pc.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.860" end="00:02:15.350">While get...frame comes from phone.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.350" end="00:02:23.090">Both of them are now available in all devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.090" end="00:02:27.840">This slide here shows a list of the functionality that you can leverage starting</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:31.780">that windows stem features that are...with an asterisk.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.920" end="00:02:35.600">...available only on devices that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.600" end="00:02:45.530">ship with windows stem support for this features is discoverable through a property.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:45.530" end="00:02:46.950">And, this session</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.950" end="00:02:53.410">will cover the first five in this list through code samples on demos.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.410" end="00:02:58.040">First let's take a look at software bitmap.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.040" end="00:03:01.570">Software bitmap is a data</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.570" end="00:03:06.350">object representing image data and provides access to pixels.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:06.350" end="00:03:10.540">It has very good interop with many of the consumers on producers which</p>
      <p begin="00:03:10.540" end="00:03:14.460">...in the next slide.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:14.460" end="00:03:18.630">As you can see in this picture software...can reproduced from</p>
      <p begin="00:03:18.630" end="00:03:22.060">...file stream using bitmap decoder</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.060" end="00:03:27.460">all from the camera through captured frame.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.460" end="00:03:35.800">You can also create your own software roadmap in the desired pixel format and size.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:35.800" end="00:03:38.390">Will soon start providing support for software...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.530" end="00:03:41.660">And, once that happens all the effects</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.660" end="00:03:46.040">...that library can be used you can also create your own custom</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.040" end="00:03:52.140">affects by getting access to the pixels the same code them can be used</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52.140" end="00:03:54.620">...video stream using I basic video</p>
      <p begin="00:03:54.620" end="00:04:01.020">effect which was covered in the audio and video creation session on witness...</p>
      <p begin="00:04:01.020" end="00:04:03.540">From...point of view.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.540" end="00:04:06.950">You can save...software roadmap to a file.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.950" end="00:04:09.940">Are stream using the bitmap encoder are</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.940" end="00:04:16.070">this plate on the screen using example software bitmap source object?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:16.070" end="00:04:19.210">Currently...is not displayed correctly</p>
      <p begin="00:04:19.210" end="00:04:25.750">...small issue rest showed this will be fixed in our next flight.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:25.750" end="00:04:26.000">You'll</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:33.410">be seeing software bitmap in use in one of the samples that we demonstrate later in the session.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33.410" end="00:04:37.060">This samples that are available today for you.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.060" end="00:04:38.370">Should cover most of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.370" end="00:04:45.140">the immediate functionality related to capture scenarios on-camera functionality?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.140" end="00:04:51.340">Many more samples...and will appear on get...</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.340" end="00:04:59.340">And, this session-level...focusing more on the first three samples in this list.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.340" end="00:05:04.740">Preview frames are very fast...because the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:04.740" end="00:05:08.150">Minimal image processing this is very useful</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.150" end="00:05:12.560">for applications that do live analysis, for example.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12.560" end="00:05:18.610">Live translation services barcode cure code detection etc.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:18.610" end="00:05:20.150">The get preview frame sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.220" end="00:05:27.040">Shows you how to get access to the current review as a video frame object.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:28.340" end="00:05:34.810">also handles device rotation and media capture lifecycle management.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.810" end="00:05:45.880">Michael show this an action and take us...review let's invite mike.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.880" end="00:05:48.020">They just...the for the introduction</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.020" end="00:06:00.330">hello everyone my name is mike and I'll be walking you through some of our samples.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.330" end="00:06:04.060">So, there's let-me prepare you for this.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.060" end="00:06:05.750">There is a lot of content in the samples</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.750" end="00:06:09.120">...that josie here and.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:13.040">I could I could spend hours here with you talking about creating camera apps</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.040" end="00:06:14.940">and all the cool things that you can do in this space.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.990" end="00:06:21.720">But, there's also a lot of great stuff going on later at build that I want to remiss so this creates a little bit of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:21.720" end="00:06:26.390">an internal conflict in me but I am going to have to keep it short.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:26.390" end="00:06:30.020">And, that means skipping over some parts of the code like some of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:30.020" end="00:06:34.690">our helper methods and some of our...handlers and also skipping over</p>
      <p begin="00:06:34.690" end="00:06:39.690">demo ing each of the samples on each of the devices but all...samples like</p>
      <p begin="00:06:39.690" end="00:06:44.640">sandeep set are available for you...right now so if you haven't done so yet please</p>
      <p begin="00:06:44.640" end="00:06:49.500">...clone are samples repository...the samples on your own devices</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.870" end="00:06:55.200">ok so let's get started and I'm going to start by showing you the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:55.200" end="00:07:00.610">...sample just to give you an idea for what it is that it does and...look for each</p>
      <p begin="00:07:00.610" end="00:07:02.190">...get preview frame.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:03.210" end="00:07:05.420">Right there.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.420" end="00:07:10.370">And, you'll see it launches straight to the preview which means that it's taken care of initialize</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.370" end="00:07:14.350">in the media capture and configuring it for use and it also</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.350" end="00:07:19.230">handles device orientations so any time I rotate my device.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:19.230" end="00:07:23.910">The preview adjusts so that it always rains upright we</p>
      <p begin="00:07:23.910" end="00:07:26.600">received feedback from you guys that.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:26.600" end="00:07:29.530">This wasn't the easiest thing to figure out so we wanted</p>
      <p begin="00:07:29.530" end="00:07:35.060">to make sure that the sample you have a good starting point for rotation as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:35.060" end="00:07:39.310">So, I'm going to tap the get previous frame button right here.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:39.310" end="00:07:41.480">And, you'll see that next to it a text</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.480" end="00:07:45.730">...is populated with the dimensions and the pixel format of the frame.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:45.730" end="00:07:49.900">Now on the linear six thirty right here that happens to be...btwelve</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.900" end="00:07:53.380">by default but keep in mind that may vary by device.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.510" end="00:07:59.390">Now the api does offer and overload that allows you to specify the picture</p>
      <p begin="00:07:59.390" end="00:08:02.620">format it'll perform the conversion for you and the sample</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02.620" end="00:08:07.130">makes use of that when we choose to show the frame in...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:07.130" end="00:08:09.760">There we go the current preview frame is now display to the right</p>
      <p begin="00:08:09.760" end="00:08:16.300">of the preview and just below it you can see that the pixel format has changed.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:16.300" end="00:08:17.740">Now as we...familiarize</p>
      <p begin="00:08:17.740" end="00:08:22.530">yourselves with the software bitmap which is the underlying object doing all of</p>
      <p begin="00:08:22.530" end="00:08:27.170">this we included some code that edits the pixels on the software bitmap to</p>
      <p begin="00:08:27.170" end="00:08:31.660">apply a simple green effect and also some code they'll say the frame</p>
      <p begin="00:08:31.660" end="00:08:35.850">to disk...give...a try.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:35.850" end="00:08:40.820">That's it by the way you can you can have a lot of fun creating your own custom effects if you haven't done so</p>
      <p begin="00:08:40.820" end="00:08:47.000">before give this a try come up with their own algorithms it's actually a lot of fun.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:47.000" end="00:08:54.710">So, let me show you let me show you the code behind all this.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:54.710" end="00:09:01.110">Get preview frame is the method on the media capture so we're going to start looking in this region.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:01.110" end="00:09:06.050">And, the method is doing all this is right here.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:06.050" end="00:09:11.000">let me scroll over and you'll see that the first thing we're doing is we're getting information</p>
      <p begin="00:09:11.000" end="00:09:15.820">about the previous stream at the moment and that is because we're going to use the with and</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.820" end="00:09:20.520">the height of the preview along with our desired pixel format.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:20.520" end="00:09:25.120">To create this video frame which describes the assault that will get from the get</p>
      <p begin="00:09:25.120" end="00:09:28.620">pre frame api we...into the api.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:29.840" end="00:09:34.340">Will return as an object that contains a software bitmap?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:34.340" end="00:09:39.300">And, that software bitmap right there is our previous frame at this point we're basically done that was all we</p>
      <p begin="00:09:39.300" end="00:09:45.050">had to do now to show you a couple more things that we can do with this we go ahead and populate</p>
      <p begin="00:09:45.050" end="00:09:46.670">...text block that you saw with</p>
      <p begin="00:09:46.670" end="00:09:51.640">the dimensions with height and the picture format of the frame.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:51.640" end="00:09:53.690">And, then depending on the state of the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.690" end="00:09:57.950">...check boxes we edit the pixels we show the frame</p>
      <p begin="00:09:57.950" end="00:10:03.020">in the ui and we can save the frame to...now let's</p>
      <p begin="00:10:03.020" end="00:10:06.560">...the mentioned before there is a small issue with displaying.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:07.810" end="00:10:11.860">The software bitmap source in...right now so,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:11.860" end="00:10:16.540">for now you might want to use this little work around the...here for you but because we have</p>
      <p begin="00:10:16.540" end="00:10:21.060">the fix ready and it's just waiting for the next slide to reach all you guys.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:21.060" end="00:10:24.940">You might as well go with of recommended pattern for that don't worry we will update</p>
      <p begin="00:10:24.940" end="00:10:28.150">...samples as soon as a fixes out.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:28.150" end="00:10:32.340">So, because we just cover to get previous frame and there's a couple more things here that I want to show you</p>
      <p begin="00:10:32.340" end="00:10:36.510">...rotation for a while.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:36.510" end="00:10:38.890">In this sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:38.890" end="00:10:45.580">use the display information object to receive orientation change notifications.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:45.580" end="00:10:46.510">Windows trigger.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:47.620" end="00:10:49.740">We go in apply the corrective rotation</p>
      <p begin="00:10:49.740" end="00:10:59.660">to the preview and for this sample I will show you exactly what the helper methodist doing.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:59.660" end="00:11:01.220">So, in the case that we're dealing with</p>
      <p begin="00:11:01.220" end="00:11:05.950">an external camera there's no work for us to do the assumption is a</p>
      <p begin="00:11:05.950" end="00:11:10.910">cameras connected over usd is probably not being subjected to the same rotations that</p>
      <p begin="00:11:10.910" end="00:11:15.410">the actual devices but otherwise we graphic current orientation</p>
      <p begin="00:11:15.410" end="00:11:21.580">of display and we convert it to a number of degrees now if the previews being mirror</p>
      <p begin="00:11:21.580" end="00:11:25.660">...and I'll talk more about that in a moment we need to match</p>
      <p begin="00:11:25.660" end="00:11:32.240">that mirroring by basically inverting rotation and once we've done all of that we</p>
      <p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:35.190">can get the current media stream properties of the preview.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:36.290" end="00:11:40.140">At the information about the rotation to them and then set them on the</p>
      <p begin="00:11:40.140" end="00:11:45.340">preview this is the way we recommend you guys to preview rotation because it</p>
      <p begin="00:11:45.340" end="00:11:50.220">says it's a lot of work it's not actually doing pixel rotation</p>
      <p begin="00:11:50.220" end="00:11:56.020">is not applying that transformation to the frames it's just adding the rotation information as pure</p>
      <p begin="00:11:56.020" end="00:12:00.660">metadata which means the actual rotation work is being deferred</p>
      <p begin="00:12:00.660" end="00:12:04.690">we later until much closer to rendering and if you think about it you</p>
      <p begin="00:12:04.690" end="00:12:06.810">could be running the preview at http.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:06.810" end="00:12:08.140">Or higher thirty frames</p>
      <p begin="00:12:08.140" end="00:12:14.710">per second that's a lot of churn to be applying this transformation to all of those frames.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:14.710" end="00:12:19.240">So, because this api was available on phone before I</p>
      <p begin="00:12:19.240" end="00:12:23.480">wanted to demo it on my laptop as well and I have it ready for</p>
      <p begin="00:12:23.480" end="00:12:28.700">you here and you'll see the ad you I looks pretty much the same as on the phone</p>
      <p begin="00:12:28.700" end="00:12:30.570">...universal apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:30.570" end="00:12:33.900">It also behaves pretty much the same notice it</p>
      <p begin="00:12:33.900" end="00:12:38.880">is a different format because it is a different device and we can choose to show the frame</p>
      <p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:44.300">...also edit the pixels right away the goal green effect of that is very unflattering</p>
      <p begin="00:12:44.300" end="00:12:50.530">...it...let's try for another one.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:50.530" end="00:12:55.250">All right let's just let's...that you'll see you'll see that there's</p>
      <p begin="00:12:55.250" end="00:12:58.870">something a little weird going on and what is that?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:58.870" end="00:13:03.160">I'm raising one hand on one side and the preview frame shows the other</p>
      <p begin="00:13:03.160" end="00:13:05.140">site being raced that is because</p>
      <p begin="00:13:05.140" end="00:13:08.510">...preview mirroring here now I'm raising my left</p>
      <p begin="00:13:08.510" end="00:13:12.420">and right now and on the live previous...to you a kind of looks like I'm raising my</p>
      <p begin="00:13:12.420" end="00:13:17.880">right-hand that's because you're on the other side of the display for me looks the preview behaves exactly like</p>
      <p begin="00:13:17.880" end="00:13:22.240">amer...something a users have come to expect from camera apps</p>
      <p begin="00:13:22.240" end="00:13:26.270">...from facing camera is just a lot easier to fix your hair check your</p>
      <p begin="00:13:26.270" end="00:13:32.250">te for something if the preview is behaving like amer.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:32.250" end="00:13:46.090">All right so I think that's all I have for you...brings in the back in.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:46.090" end="00:13:49.860">So, let's now...about the camera capture sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:49.860" end="00:13:53.940">So, the camera capture sample is a great starting point for</p>
      <p begin="00:13:53.940" end="00:13:59.270">capture scenarios and it's very easy to extend it basically</p>
      <p begin="00:13:59.270" end="00:14:03.990">approach to the functionality of photon video capture along with the along with a</p>
      <p begin="00:14:03.990" end="00:14:09.370">live video preview it also allows you to do concurrent photon</p>
      <p begin="00:14:09.370" end="00:14:13.340">video record if the device supports it.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:13.340" end="00:14:17.360">It also handles device rotation and manages your.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:17.360" end="00:14:21.360">Lifetime management of the media capture just like the get previous frame</p>
      <p begin="00:14:21.360" end="00:14:22.450">sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:22.450" end="00:14:29.910">So, michael take...into...on this as well excellent.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:29.910" end="00:14:35.920">Switch back computer.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:35.920" end="00:14:36.580">And, again,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:36.580" end="00:14:41.580">I'll start off by showing you the sample itself we called this one the universal</p>
      <p begin="00:14:41.580" end="00:14:45.440">...sample that's also the name that you'll find...for</p>
      <p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:51.830">...in our samples repository and you'll see this time the preview is a</p>
      <p begin="00:14:51.830" end="00:14:56.610">nice full-screen preview with overlaid semi transparent buttons we went all-out in the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:56.610" end="00:14:58.450">ui for this one and,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:58.450" end="00:15:05.350">there's to capture buttons on the site so let's give...a try this have you smil right there.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:05.350" end="00:15:08.940">All right beautiful and I'm going to record...short video as well</p>
      <p begin="00:15:08.940" end="00:15:10.500">in japan across the stage.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:11.710" end="00:15:16.250">There we go the lighting is really not working for us here that's fine.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:16.250" end="00:15:20.790">Now you'll notice the other capture button disappears when I'm using one of them</p>
      <p begin="00:15:20.790" end="00:15:23.380">caroline for later.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:23.380" end="00:15:28.030">This sample actually shares a lot of code with get preview</p>
      <p begin="00:15:28.030" end="00:15:32.210">...sample and later on when you have a closer look at the samples you will find</p>
      <p begin="00:15:32.210" end="00:15:35.340">...similarities there are no</p>
      <p begin="00:15:35.340" end="00:15:40.190">to major differences the first one of course is a types of captures that we're doing we're</p>
      <p begin="00:15:40.190" end="00:15:44.330">caption photos and videos as opposed to getting preview frames and the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:44.330" end="00:15:50.840">second one is the way we handle the orientations scenarios and let-me demo that right now.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:50.840" end="00:15:52.630">So, you'll see.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:52.630" end="00:16:01.390">That when I rotate the device the buttons always remain on the same edge of the screen.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:01.390" end="00:16:05.180">Just like the navigation buttons at the bottom they just rotate in</p>
      <p begin="00:16:05.180" end="00:16:05.680">place.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:06.780" end="00:16:17.120">To adapt and remain operate so let me start by showing you the code to do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:17.120" end="00:16:21.500">We're setting up or you why in one of our helper functions.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:21.500" end="00:16:22.500">We declare and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:22.500" end="00:16:27.140">...rotation preference and you can think of this as a rotation</p>
      <p begin="00:16:27.140" end="00:16:33.120">...within your app now it may not always be granted</p>
      <p begin="00:16:33.120" end="00:16:36.260">and the reason for this is that there's, there's</p>
      <p begin="00:16:36.260" end="00:16:40.770">situations are scenarios like the desktop where you can have multiple apps and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:40.770" end="00:16:45.590">one app shouldn't really prevent your whole environment from rotating or, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:45.590" end="00:16:50.000">not matching the orientation of everything else so even though we're declaring this</p>
      <p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:56.050">on multi app almost absent areas we still need to subscribe to those events to the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:56.050" end="00:17:02.450">orientation changed events and you'll find two different kinds for those in the sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:02.450" end="00:17:06.980">The first one we seen already it's a display information orientation change this is part of the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:06.980" end="00:17:10.980">similarities that this sample...with the get previous, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:10.980" end="00:17:15.240">and, this will trigger whenever you see that rotation animation going on</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.240" end="00:17:20.269">...platform does...before it updates the layout for your page.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:20.269" end="00:17:23.679">And, the other one this is what's the what's new here is the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:28.179">orientation sensor and this one will trigger regardless of whether orientation</p>
      <p begin="00:17:28.179" end="00:17:30.819">...engage are not regardless of whether the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:30.819" end="00:17:34.909">auto rotation preference is being honored or not and this is a method that we're</p>
      <p begin="00:17:34.909" end="00:17:39.790">using to update the orientation of our buttons.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:39.790" end="00:17:43.320">So, all of this code is already implemented here seo articles</p>
      <p begin="00:17:43.320" end="00:17:48.010">look later on leverage it for your own apps if you think about it keeping the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:48.010" end="00:17:52.730">buttons on the same edge of the screen is basically the same experience...camera app gives</p>
      <p begin="00:17:52.730" end="00:17:59.660">you so it might be a little more familiar for users it's something for you to consider.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:59.660" end="00:18:01.970">So, let's get this can over to the to the actual capture</p>
      <p begin="00:18:01.970" end="00:18:09.540">site now and we'll start by looking at how to take a photo.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:09.540" end="00:18:10.600">And, here's a little trick on</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.600" end="00:18:13.990">a show you remember when we were doing capture.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:15.090" end="00:18:18.870">That one of the buttons always disappeared were capturing photo video disappeared</p>
      <p begin="00:18:18.870" end="00:18:22.610">were capturing video the...buttons appear to...</p>
      <p begin="00:18:22.610" end="00:18:26.840">many windows devices support capturing photos and videos at the same time.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:26.840" end="00:18:30.080">The linear six thirty right here being an entry-level device</p>
      <p begin="00:18:30.080" end="00:18:34.040">...not support that but finding out if that is supporter not on the...your</p>
      <p begin="00:18:34.040" end="00:18:37.260">...running on is easy...reading this property.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:38.410" end="00:18:43.250">Now if you want to take this to the next level you should really have a look at the camera profile</p>
      <p begin="00:18:43.250" end="00:18:44.480">sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:48.330">That will show you how to do concurrent capture with multiple cameras</p>
      <p begin="00:18:48.330" end="00:18:51.360">at the same time or for more granularity</p>
      <p begin="00:18:51.360" end="00:18:55.020">...can tell you exactly what combinations of for solutions are</p>
      <p begin="00:18:55.020" end="00:18:58.760">supporter for simultaneous photo and video capture so</p>
      <p begin="00:18:58.760" end="00:19:04.060">...will talk more about that later anyway let's get back to thinking of photo.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:04.060" end="00:19:08.110">You can see here that we're capturing...choicestream in</p>
      <p begin="00:19:08.110" end="00:19:12.660">the jpeg format and then at the same time while we're doing this capture</p>
      <p begin="00:19:12.660" end="00:19:16.240">we're getting the current orientation of the camera and.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:20.820">We...current orientation and the stream to...to a helper method</p>

      <p begin="00:19:24.910" end="00:19:29.290">picture library this jpeg file will support multiple orientations because of</p>
      <p begin="00:19:29.290" end="00:19:34.790">this now recording a video is even easier.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:34.790" end="00:19:36.110">We start by creating...</p>
      <p begin="00:19:36.110" end="00:19:41.110">storage file we create our encoding profile for the video in this case mp</p>
      <p begin="00:19:41.110" end="00:19:45.780">for and then same patterns before we get the current orientation of</p>
      <p begin="00:19:45.780" end="00:19:49.700">the camera we apply that to our encoding profile directly.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:50.760" end="00:19:54.850">And, then we can just start recording...video encoding profile with the</p>
      <p begin="00:19:54.850" end="00:19:57.910">encoding profile to the storage file there's no need for any</p>
      <p begin="00:19:57.910" end="00:20:04.520">cover methods I will do all of that rotation and file saving here.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:04.520" end="00:20:09.340">Now because we're doing video recordingwe recommend you subscribe to the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:09.340" end="00:20:13.710">record limitation exceeded event of the media capture you'll find that under</p>

      <p begin="00:20:31.250" end="00:20:37.150">take but this is how you can prepare your app for that scenario and you'll see here</p>
      <p begin="00:20:37.150" end="00:20:41.570">we are stopping video recording at this point and updating</p>
      <p begin="00:20:41.570" end="00:20:45.990">argue I to reflect this but you might want to go that extra step and try to start a</p>

      <p begin="00:23:00.010" end="00:23:02.330">This was a lot of stuff so let me do a quick recap of</p>
      <p begin="00:23:02.330" end="00:23:05.870">we looked at we started by talking about</p>
      <p begin="00:23:05.870" end="00:23:10.760">rotation and how there's two objects that are delivering the information that we need to</p>
      <p begin="00:23:10.760" end="00:23:14.810">...scenarios...display information class and the simple orientations</p>
      <p begin="00:23:14.810" end="00:23:20.210">...then we moved over to the captures and we saw how to take a photo how</p>
      <p begin="00:23:20.210" end="00:23:26.290">to recorder video and support multiple orientations multiple aspirations?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:26.290" end="00:23:31.290">After that we went over and looked at the recording at the events that the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:31.290" end="00:23:35.960">media capture races that any camera application should handle record limitation exceeded</p>
      <p begin="00:23:35.960" end="00:23:40.200">and media capture failed and finally the.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:40.200" end="00:23:44.610">Shutter button events the hardware shutter...events that are just so interesting for</p>
      <p begin="00:23:44.610" end="00:23:49.740">...scenarios so all of these are basic features that any camera application</p>
      <p begin="00:23:49.740" end="00:23:53.590">...cover and we already implemented them here for you guys to learn from</p>
      <p begin="00:23:53.590" end="00:23:56.710">...leverage straight in your projects</p>
      <p begin="00:23:56.710" end="00:24:04.950">thank you thank you mike for the detailed explanation.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:04.950" end="00:24:08.120">The beauty of these samples is that there are highly extensible.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:09.350" end="00:24:13.730">We invite you to take this samples and customize them to your needs</p>
      <p begin="00:24:13.730" end="00:24:29.450">rather than reinventing the wheel our next sample demonstrates this extensibility.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:29.450" end="00:24:33.790">The face detection sample is a simple on direct extension of the camera</p>
      <p begin="00:24:33.790" end="00:24:35.410">...sample.</p>

      <p begin="00:24:40.130" end="00:24:43.190">do is...affect and listen to an event.</p>

      <p begin="00:25:07.970" end="00:25:13.440">add face detection to your camera app and again let's just fire up the sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:15.080">...looks.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:15.080" end="00:25:19.320">There's that unflattering angle...anyway recognise the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:19.320" end="00:25:24.010">...from the previous sample that we saw the basic capture buttons on this site plus the addition of</p>
      <p begin="00:25:24.010" end="00:25:30.600">a new faces action button on the other site...see how it works.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:30.600" end="00:25:35.580">We go all blue on blue might not work so well but you can see the rectangle...on my face as</p>
      <p begin="00:25:35.580" end="00:25:41.000">I move around it's tracking me so let's bring sandeep in can-you come into the frame</p>
      <p begin="00:25:41.000" end="00:25:45.320">...up there we go so we're tracking multiple faces and you'll see that</p>
      <p begin="00:25:45.320" end="00:25:54.280">there's two different shades of blue being used here and I'll explain why in a moment.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:54.280" end="00:26:00.340">So, jumping into the code now.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:00.340" end="00:26:03.620">There's basically two things that we need to do in our example</p>
      <p begin="00:26:03.620" end="00:26:09.870">table face detection we decided to add a button that's the first thing...button will enable and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:09.870" end="00:26:14.840">the sable the effect the second thing we need to do is</p>
      <p begin="00:26:14.840" end="00:26:17.720">...some sort of control that will...all of the face detection</p>
      <p begin="00:26:17.720" end="00:26:20.750">...boxes we went with the canvas called</p>
      <p begin="00:26:20.750" end="00:26:25.460">faces canvas and you'll notice that it's actually wrapped in a second canvas</p>
      <p begin="00:26:25.460" end="00:26:30.350">...is because it makes it easier for us to deal with things such as rotation</p>
      <p begin="00:26:30.350" end="00:26:34.200">or letter boxing of the preview is a previous stream doesn't match the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:34.200" end="00:26:40.330">aspect ratio off the screen that is being displayed on the size of your window basically.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:40.330" end="00:26:44.120">Now as for the code there's three things that we need to do we need to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:44.120" end="00:26:48.060">enable face detection we need to handle the face detection events and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:48.060" end="00:26:54.820">we need to clean it up so let's look at how to enable it first.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:54.820" end="00:26:57.830">...for doing it's right here and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:57.830" end="00:27:02.730">we start off by creating of face detection effect definition and effective</p>
      <p begin="00:27:02.730" end="00:27:05.090">...is an object that allows you to</p>
      <p begin="00:27:05.090" end="00:27:09.790">set some of the properties on the effect they need to be said before the effect is actually created,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:09.790" end="00:27:13.790">for example, we choose not to run face detection synchronous</p>
      <p begin="00:27:13.790" end="00:27:21.050">...because we wouldn't want to delay any preview frames just because the face detection...running on them.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:21.050" end="00:27:24.880">Then we sets then we have the face detection effect two-run in high-performance</p>
      <p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:27.530">...over the other two precepts that we offer</p>
      <p begin="00:27:27.530" end="00:27:31.010">which are high-quality and the balanced preset.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:32.110" end="00:27:35.390">So, after we've done this we can add the face detection effect</p>
      <p begin="00:27:35.390" end="00:27:38.460">to the pipeline and we're adding it to the video preview</p>
      <p begin="00:27:38.460" end="00:27:44.280">face detection is an effect that you would want to run on the preview most of the time this will actually return you</p>
      <p begin="00:27:44.280" end="00:27:48.950">an instance to the actual effect and all that affect you can subscribe to the face</p>
      <p begin="00:27:48.950" end="00:27:53.430">...event you can set a minimum detection interval in case you want</p>
      <p begin="00:27:53.430" end="00:27:58.360">to space out the events and maybe go a little later on the resources and finally you</p>
      <p begin="00:27:58.360" end="00:28:03.190">can enable face detection and ur detecting faces at this point now</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.190" end="00:28:07.720">face detection enabling it can be as little sfour lines of code you don't need</p>
      <p begin="00:28:07.720" end="00:28:13.560">to all of this but I just wanted to show you some of the properties that you can play around with now</p>
      <p begin="00:28:13.560" end="00:28:19.890">before we go over and look at the face detection events on a show you how to clean-up face detection when you're done with it.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:19.890" end="00:28:25.210">As you can see is also pretty simple in fact if, you know, you'll be using face</p>
      <p begin="00:28:25.210" end="00:28:29.620">detection again shortly you can get away with just disabling it and then re enabling</p>
      <p begin="00:28:29.620" end="00:28:36.570">it later which...of the work of reconfiguring it and re adding it to the pipeline.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:36.570" end="00:28:40.430">Okay, we get to see the face detection events now.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.430" end="00:28:45.130">And, I'm going to give you a little warning this is what makes the bulk of the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:45.130" end="00:28:49.610">code this is because there's a lot of ui calculations being down here</p>
      <p begin="00:28:49.610" end="00:28:53.500">that are completely optional you get all the benefits of the face</p>
      <p begin="00:28:53.500" end="00:28:56.320">detection effect namely automatic exposure and</p>
      <p begin="00:28:56.320" end="00:29:01.630">faces focus just by enabling the effect you don't need to highlight the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:01.630" end="00:29:04.930">faces in the ui but it's a pretty cool thing to do so</p>
      <p begin="00:29:04.930" end="00:29:07.510">I'll show you how that's being done.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:07.510" end="00:29:11.760">You can see that were asking the dispatcher to update ru ip running</p>
      <p begin="00:29:11.760" end="00:29:15.960">this helper method on the list of detected faces that the event</p>
      <p begin="00:29:15.960" end="00:29:22.830">...to us and this is another helper method that I will go into detail.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:22.830" end="00:29:24.990">The first thing it does is of course</p>
      <p begin="00:29:24.990" end="00:29:30.400">clear any existing rectangles from the faces canvas these are rectangles</p>
      <p begin="00:29:30.400" end="00:29:35.400">ave remained from the previous event that we've received so we throw all of those</p>
      <p begin="00:29:35.400" end="00:29:40.320">away and then for each face that we've received we first</p>
      <p begin="00:29:40.320" end="00:29:44.320">of all convert the coordinates of the face box which is the bounding</p>
      <p begin="00:29:44.320" end="00:29:49.830">...on the face from existing in terms of the preview resolution to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:49.830" end="00:29:54.800">existing in terms of the size of our capture element which is our preview control in the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:54.800" end="00:29:58.900">y and we need to do this because there's probably going to be a scaling factor</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.900" end="00:30:03.240">between the two it's rare that...preview will run at the exact resolution</p>
      <p begin="00:30:03.240" end="00:30:08.200">that it's being displayed on the screen this is nothing too complicated it's basically direct</p>
      <p begin="00:30:08.200" end="00:30:12.830">grabbing each property of the facebook dividing it by the corresponding dimension of the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:12.830" end="00:30:17.000">previous stream which gives you a relative value between zero and one which you can then</p>
      <p begin="00:30:17.000" end="00:30:22.340">multiply by the size of your capture element in the ui so once all</p>
      <p begin="00:30:22.340" end="00:30:26.010">that is done we just choose what we want our face</p>
      <p begin="00:30:26.010" end="00:30:29.530">detection right-angle the highlight part to look like we're</p>
      <p begin="00:30:29.530" end="00:30:34.340">...a stroke any color and right...where you can see where special casing the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:34.340" end="00:30:39.280">first face this is where the two different shades of blue came from and that's because the first phase</p>
      <p begin="00:30:39.280" end="00:30:43.090">that you received in this event is what we call the most important</p>
      <p begin="00:30:43.090" end="00:30:48.220">...in the scene it's the phase that will drive automatic exposure...drive continues</p>
      <p begin="00:30:48.220" end="00:30:53.720">...focus to focus on that person so after we've done that we add</p>
      <p begin="00:30:53.720" end="00:30:58.530">...to the canvas the...being highlighted.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:58.530" end="00:31:01.090">And, finally if you remember from the get</p>
      <p begin="00:31:01.090" end="00:31:05.590">preview frame sample I mention that we're not actually applying rotation to</p>
      <p begin="00:31:05.590" end="00:31:10.230">the preview pixels all of that is being done downstream so any</p>
      <p begin="00:31:10.230" end="00:31:15.130">rotation meta data that we've added to the previous stream we need to match that rotation</p>
      <p begin="00:31:15.130" end="00:31:20.290">on the faces canvas and this is a reason why it was wrapped in...another canvas</p>
      <p begin="00:31:20.290" end="00:31:25.070">...salmon when I showed you that so hopefully that makes a little more sense now</p>
      <p begin="00:31:25.070" end="00:31:33.960">it makes it makes just calculations in this method are easier to deal with.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:33.960" end="00:31:37.010">I think that's all I have for you for this sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:37.010" end="00:31:40.670">...pretty cool clear wrong with it what do you think</p>

      <p begin="00:33:23.470" end="00:33:29.860">...event is happening exactly when you want.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:29.860" end="00:33:36.970">Okay, we got rotation working...other captures.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:36.970" end="00:33:42.060">All right you'll see the video playing back.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:42.060" end="00:33:44.750">...sandeep gains...to disappear</p>
      <p begin="00:33:50.370" end="00:33:54.820">So, as you can see this feature enables those fund edit as you record scenario</p>
      <p begin="00:33:54.820" end="00:34:00.750">scenarios are becoming so popular now that sharing videos is so prevalent and,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:00.750" end="00:34:05.700">...even though it's as simple api to use it still gives you control over whether you want that</p>
      <p begin="00:34:05.700" end="00:34:10.540">very low latency or whether you want to be a little easier on the resources so,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.540" end="00:34:12.900">when you look at msdn pay attention to the</p>
      <p begin="00:34:12.900" end="00:34:19.220">behavior parameter that you pass into the...method thank you?</p>
      <p begin="00:34:19.220" end="00:34:23.730">Thank you...what you over...</p>
      <p begin="00:34:23.730" end="00:34:26.630">Ok, so, now let's move on</p>
      <p begin="00:34:26.630" end="00:34:30.900">move to another feature that is more powerful than the features that we have</p>
      <p begin="00:34:30.900" end="00:34:35.610">...so far video civilization so.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:36.630" end="00:34:39.330">We destabilization can be enabled very similar</p>
      <p begin="00:34:39.330" end="00:34:43.050">to face detection all you need to do is in</p>
      <p begin="00:34:43.050" end="00:34:49.380">the affect configured recommended resolution and start recording.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:49.380" end="00:34:51.990">We'll show you a demo video.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:53.000" end="00:34:55.600">Showcasing the stability achieved through video stabilization</p>
      <p begin="00:34:56.740" end="00:35:00.980">for the demo we capture the scene using to entry-level phones</p>
      <p begin="00:35:00.980" end="00:35:05.280">setup side-by-side on this evaluation rig one of the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:06.910">phones has...</p>
      <p begin="00:35:06.910" end="00:35:25.050">turned on the other doesn't have it on let's take a look at the demo video now.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:56.970" end="00:35:58.070">Folks.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:58.070" end="00:36:01.710">Node that this is running in realtime on an entry-level device.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:02.720" end="00:36:10.400">That's impressive.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:10.400" end="00:36:12.300">So, we'll covered the first</p>
      <p begin="00:36:12.300" end="00:36:17.210">five features in this list already me step back and say that if you're working</p>
      <p begin="00:36:17.210" end="00:36:21.220">on a feature that is not supported on a device that you have.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:21.220" end="00:36:24.530">You can get started with emulator.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:24.530" end="00:36:29.220">Let's focus on the rest of the features briefly.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:29.220" end="00:36:33.440">Video frame is a data object closely related to software</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.440" end="00:36:38.350">bitmap and basically carries time stamps.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:38.350" end="00:36:40.750">It is more.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:40.750" end="00:36:47.150">in scenarios where you have a video stream and you have a continuous flow of pictures.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:47.150" end="00:36:53.560">So, it can also represent cpu memory as well as cpu memory.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:53.560" end="00:36:57.620">...geo-tagged helper in api that allows you to tag and</p>
      <p begin="00:36:57.620" end="00:37:02.530">image with the current geo location of the device even when the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:02.530" end="00:37:06.720">requesting app has been suspended are closed.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:11.240">This is very useful because the geo location service can take a</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.240" end="00:37:15.560">long-time up to thirty seconds to written the current location</p>
      <p begin="00:37:15.560" end="00:37:23.030">and by the time the user may how suspended app after capturing a picture basically.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:23.030" end="00:37:24.670">Variable photo sequence</p>
      <p begin="00:37:24.670" end="00:37:29.310">also map to specify bracketed shots for capture.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:29.310" end="00:37:32.820">And, this is a very fundamental block in computational photography scenarios.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:34.110" end="00:37:37.490">This was available only on the phone earlier and now it's</p>
      <p begin="00:37:37.490" end="00:37:42.890">available on our windows devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:42.890" end="00:37:45.600">We have recede feedback from many of you</p>
      <p begin="00:37:45.600" end="00:37:50.470">that creating a flashlight application needs access to camera</p>
      <p begin="00:37:50.470" end="00:37:52.570">and consumes unnecessary resources.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:53.840" end="00:37:58.810">Have acted on that feedback and now you can control the lamp also known as</p>
      <p begin="00:37:58.810" end="00:37:59.920">flash?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:59.920" end="00:38:07.030">Without access to camera on supported windows...devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:07.030" end="00:38:09.970">Michael alluded to this feature earlier.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09.970" end="00:38:14.130">The camera profiles is a great way to make the most of your</p>
      <p begin="00:38:14.130" end="00:38:17.610">camera it helps you with the fine-grain this code</p>
      <p begin="00:38:17.610" end="00:38:22.450">ability of the concurrent capabilities of a device.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:22.450" end="00:38:26.750">For example, let's say there's a device that can support</p>
      <p begin="00:38:26.750" end="00:38:31.620">...resolution when one of the camera is active.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:31.620" end="00:38:35.050">And, if it cannot support four-k but can only support</p>
      <p begin="00:38:35.050" end="00:38:40.050">up to nntp when both front and back cameras are active.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:40.050" end="00:38:43.510">In the past such devices did not advertise before</p>
      <p begin="00:38:43.510" end="00:38:47.190">...resolution but now it's possible</p>
      <p begin="00:38:47.190" end="00:38:54.540">thanks to profiles where you can discover under what conditions which resolutions are available.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:54.540" end="00:38:59.240">Smoot zoom allows a nice gradual transition to the target zoom</p>
      <p begin="00:38:59.240" end="00:39:00.660">factor.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:00.660" end="00:39:03.900">Rather than a direct zoom which sometimes can be jarring.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:04.990" end="00:39:08.420">In the past hops emulated this by.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:09.500" end="00:39:14.020">Calling resume api multiple times...small steps this</p>
      <p begin="00:39:14.020" end="00:39:22.480">is now supported by the platform...is done in a performant manner.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:22.480" end="00:39:27.050">High dynamic range video is also available on supported windows</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.050" end="00:39:27.700">...devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:28.860" end="00:39:35.680">You might notice that high dynamic range photo is not listed here the list</p>
      <p begin="00:39:35.680" end="00:39:41.600">Shows the api is that can be found in...available today we're working</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.600" end="00:39:48.130">on advance capture photo api that covers high dynamic range photo.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:48.130" end="00:39:55.560">It will be available when windows townships if not earlier.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:55.560" end="00:39:59.440">Sq video recording is a great use case scenario for</p>
      <p begin="00:40:01.030" end="00:40:03.500">...instagram apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:03.500" end="00:40:07.440">And, we have enabled that.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:07.440" end="00:40:09.040">This is enabled in a much more</p>
      <p begin="00:40:09.040" end="00:40:13.170">performant manner and apps don't how to.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:13.170" end="00:40:15.900">Do a lot of work to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:15.900" end="00:40:22.630">...and do the cropping its supported natively by the platform now?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:22.630" end="00:40:27.300">...analysis affect can help them enabling...</p>
      <p begin="00:40:27.300" end="00:40:31.500">Automatic capturing of good pictures balancing between</p>
      <p begin="00:40:31.500" end="00:40:36.230">...are and cases where you don't need...analysis</p>
      <p begin="00:40:36.230" end="00:40:40.740">gives you an indication of when it is useful to capture picture</p>
      <p begin="00:40:40.740" end="00:40:45.660">using hdf it also provides some of the information on the camera's</p>
      <p begin="00:40:45.660" end="00:40:52.680">sensor such as exposure level iso values and many more details.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:52.680" end="00:40:57.580">Finally we also done work to enabler enterprise customers to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:57.580" end="00:41:03.670">set policies that control access to camera we hope you can leverage all of these</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03.670" end="00:41:08.040">and basically get started with the samples that we</p>
      <p begin="00:41:08.040" end="00:41:12.370">have available today we are excited about this and we hope</p>
      <p begin="00:41:12.370" end="00:41:22.540">you are to please welcome mike to say a few final words.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:22.540" end="00:41:27.400">...thank you for coming to build thank you for coming to the...session as you saw we've</p>
      <p begin="00:41:27.400" end="00:41:31.820">done some samples in a different way the break-away from</p>
      <p begin="00:41:31.820" end="00:41:35.900">our usual format of using the sdk template and,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:35.900" end="00:41:40.310">this is something that's new for us so we're very interested in hearing</p>
      <p begin="00:41:40.310" end="00:41:44.890">your feedback to samples like this a cover into and scenarios that behave almost like</p>
      <p begin="00:41:44.890" end="00:41:49.530">real apps are they are they helping you are is this a good model to</p>
      <p begin="00:41:49.530" end="00:41:54.280">carry for work so give us that feedback sandeep and I will be at the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:54.280" end="00:41:59.250">insiders lounge for the next hour and a half and later on at the experts</p>
      <p begin="00:41:59.250" end="00:42:04.140">own from one fifteen until three pm when everyone's packing up you'll still</p>
      <p begin="00:42:04.140" end="00:42:09.280">find us over there so, come over have a chat with us maybe play with the samples for</p>
      <p begin="00:42:09.280" end="00:42:14.160">a little bit now if you if you can't make it or if you're watching online</p>
      <p begin="00:42:14.160" end="00:42:17.980">then I invite you all to go on the msdn forums engage</p>
      <p begin="00:42:17.980" end="00:42:22.960">with us engage with each other give us feedback talk to us about the camera</p>
      <p begin="00:42:22.960" end="00:42:28.010">...stuff that you like to see if you if you have really pressing feedback I want to all</p>
      <p begin="00:42:28.010" end="00:42:32.030">...email send us centers...and build camera at microsoft-dot-com</p>
      <p begin="00:42:32.030" end="00:42:36.490">your reach indeed your reach media reach the entire camera api team.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:36.490" end="00:42:41.020">So, let us know what your developer experiences like let us know the things that you think...it</p>
      <p begin="00:42:41.020" end="00:42:49.990">...to keep doing the things that you think.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:53.860" end="00:42:55.310">Go ahead.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:55.310" end="00:42:59.280">Let's say we have a question from the audience.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:59.280" end="00:43:01.810">To somewhat related questions but early argued</p>
      <p begin="00:43:01.810" end="00:43:06.320">mention that was now the possibility of doing multiple calmer capture</p>
      <p begin="00:43:07.500" end="00:43:10.550">...desktop device or laptop tablet</p>
      <p begin="00:43:10.550" end="00:43:14.610">...any reasonable restriction to the number of see usb cameras that you</p>
      <p begin="00:43:14.610" end="00:43:19.070">can connect it depends on the device capability so,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:19.070" end="00:43:24.310">you know, the...sop also needs to support that if the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:24.310" end="00:43:27.200">...supports it and it's advertised it should be</p>
      <p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:31.800">possible so that's where the camera profiles feature comes into picture the other questions</p>
      <p begin="00:43:31.800" end="00:43:35.850">you have is a number of your start things like the each...video and the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:35.850" end="00:43:39.910">like required windows ten device I assume that does not</p>
      <p begin="00:43:39.910" end="00:43:45.580">mean say nokia fifteen twenty with that's been updated to windows</p>
      <p begin="00:43:45.580" end="00:43:49.470">ten it means a new device correct so the question would be what would be the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:49.470" end="00:43:53.690">first windows ten device phone that we could get tested out</p>
      <p begin="00:43:53.690" end="00:43:58.520">of hardware we cannot disclose that yet but you'll soon hear about it</p>
      <p begin="00:43:58.520" end="00:44:03.530">gift-giving try give the emulator a try we've updated with a lot of the features that are</p>
      <p begin="00:44:03.530" end="00:44:08.440">available on windows ten launch devices so that you can get a headstart with developing</p>
      <p begin="00:44:08.440" end="00:44:12.850">your solution before you can finally get one of those devices that we are also very excited about</p>
      <p begin="00:44:12.850" end="00:44:17.920">...thank you just a question with the face detection</p>
      <p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:22.680">...does api offer any exposure to the decomposition</p>
      <p begin="00:44:22.680" end="00:44:28.200">...eigenvalues or whatever's use so that you can do facial analysis not</p>
      <p begin="00:44:28.200" end="00:44:32.630">...but we're certainly welcome to hear from your</p>
      <p begin="00:44:32.630" end="00:44:35.430">use scenarios and then we'll work to enable the</p>
      <p begin="00:44:35.430" end="00:44:41.090">...email and email recap later if you have time?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:41.090" end="00:44:44.030">The seen analysis give you any information about</p>
      <p begin="00:44:44.030" end="00:44:52.670">...follicular detection your not yet right now right now it is doing the high dynamic range.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:52.670" end="00:44:57.190">Prediction basically but the plan is the scene analysis as a component to</p>
      <p begin="00:44:57.190" end="00:45:03.870">expand on what capabilities task basically so great-great suggestion thank you.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:03.870" end="00:45:08.480">...I want to know the...dieter of</p>
      <p begin="00:45:08.480" end="00:45:14.780">...videos so it's a video you need to use</p>
      <p begin="00:45:14.780" end="00:45:15.280">heidi.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:16.480" end="00:45:22.170">Exposure and road tx process so how do you gets.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:22.170" end="00:45:25.850">Once forty-one...sure so are you talking about</p>
      <p begin="00:45:25.850" end="00:45:32.770">...video of hd photo video...video so difference on</p>
      <p begin="00:45:32.770" end="00:45:37.630">the sensor underneath so that can be different technologies enabling...video so,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:37.630" end="00:45:40.500">depending on the censor, you know, it can be either of those,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:40.500" end="00:45:45.510">... it can be a sensor that is able to capture both low explosion</p>
      <p begin="00:45:45.510" end="00:45:51.120">exposure the same time or it does some sort of a bracketing basically but,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:51.120" end="00:45:54.450">that's the device level variation</p>
      <p begin="00:45:54.450" end="00:45:57.840">...the platform level you don't have to deal with any of that all you do</p>
      <p begin="00:45:57.840" end="00:46:02.820">is the z the control that you go on enable and then if the device supports that you're getting history</p>
      <p begin="00:46:02.820" end="00:46:06.450">...video...a possible solution for this would be</p>
      <p begin="00:46:06.450" end="00:46:11.260">interleaving each role to expose at a different level...and that</p>
      <p begin="00:46:11.260" end="00:46:16.250">...need to run your can video capture at three times a frame rate and varying the exposure in-between</p>
      <p begin="00:46:16.250" end="00:46:21.400">...by...and approach okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:21.400" end="00:46:24.030">...question and dual camera dual...will be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:46:24.030" end="00:46:29.140">support dual camera let's take the offline.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:29.140" end="00:46:36.050">...might be a better person for the whole...team instead of a camera api team.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:36.050" end="00:46:42.130">Sorry could you could...at least one camera right definitely but that's</p>
      <p begin="00:46:42.130" end="00:46:43.680">a promise of universal...</p>
      <p begin="00:46:44.950" end="00:46:50.210">Right how many more...other things we can discuss later with.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:50.210" end="00:46:52.220">...sdk provide cropping</p>
      <p begin="00:46:52.220" end="00:46:56.340">...stabilizing the alignment, yeah, and, like</p>
      <p begin="00:46:56.340" end="00:46:58.880">...received capture...by</p>
      <p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:04.140">...anything like that so the video stabilization feature if you want to get</p>
      <p begin="00:47:04.140" end="00:47:08.660">...a crop format you can get that it's your choice as an app developer</p>
      <p begin="00:47:08.660" end="00:47:12.780">...you wanted back into the full resolution that came in you can have</p>
      <p begin="00:47:12.780" end="00:47:14.500">that's where the recommended resolution comes</p>
      <p begin="00:47:14.500" end="00:47:19.920">and we recommend resolution but you're not required to go with that basically this is more for image</p>
      <p begin="00:47:19.920" end="00:47:23.130">like you want to capture receipt and online it and I</p>
      <p begin="00:47:23.130" end="00:47:27.460">said so it's not supported image level it's mainly for the video at this</p>
      <p begin="00:47:27.460" end="00:47:32.260">...I don't I don't think we're talking about visualization here...</p>
      <p begin="00:47:32.260" end="00:47:36.000">For...image stabilization...he's talking about your allows us</p>
      <p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:40.380">...processing images...images so...sdk has</p>
      <p begin="00:47:40.380" end="00:47:45.770">api is that you can leverage to in online images if you are interested in that, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:45.770" end="00:47:49.420">and, as soon as...publish...update you can keep all your data in the software</p>
      <p begin="00:47:49.420" end="00:47:57.210">bitmap and pusher on to the different components that will offer you the functionality that you're asking about.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:57.210" end="00:48:02.310">What please don't forget earlier session all right these...thank you?</p>
