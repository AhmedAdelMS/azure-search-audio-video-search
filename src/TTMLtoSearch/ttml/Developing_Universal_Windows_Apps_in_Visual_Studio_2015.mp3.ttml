      <p begin="00:01:17.200" end="00:01:22.100">required for developing universal windows app and then build your first universal...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.100" end="00:01:27.350">right so this is going live right now they are in the chain of getting published</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.350" end="00:01:34.250">...the end of the...you should be able to go and download all this stuff and start building...application?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.250" end="00:01:40.290">...installing visual studio make sure that you go to the custom set-up and select</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.290" end="00:01:45.260">universal windows are development tools and if you're interested in emulator you should select that as</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.260" end="00:01:49.780">about everything we're going to talk about today the require you to have universal</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.780" end="00:01:55.130">windows app tools installed as part of your studio if you don't have it then windows</p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.130" end="00:01:58.940">...not be supported so as you installing visual studio go to the custom</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.940" end="00:02:04.930">...make sure...that jag to a wide any future surprises.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.930" end="00:02:09.360">So, let's talk about the agenda and...simple.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:14.660">I'm going to go and start with the introduction to windows universal platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.660" end="00:02:19.070">And, I'm pretty sure most of you have already seen the keynote and,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.070" end="00:02:23.740">...kind of outlined some of the details about us of windows platform some of you must</p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.740" end="00:02:27.120">...also attended andrew clinics...app model chechen</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:31.820">he also kind of talks about how application model works and what what's the new in the you with</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.820" end="00:02:38.120">windows platform so I will give you a quick overview of that and after that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.120" end="00:02:42.430">...deep dive into some of the visual studio two-lane that we have done to support</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.430" end="00:02:47.570">...windows app we have what across many different features so in my</p>
      <p begin="00:02:47.570" end="00:02:51.610">shun I will be going and try to go as many features as possible and mostly</p>
      <p begin="00:02:51.610" end="00:02:57.370">we'll be talking giving an overview of these features we have also schedule some deep dive</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.370" end="00:03:02.180">into some of the big features which I think...be very which we think we're going to be very interesting from a</p>
      <p begin="00:03:02.180" end="00:03:06.590">...standpoint so I will be mentioning goshen and you will also find a</p>
      <p begin="00:03:06.590" end="00:03:11.260">jail for goshen that literature sharon's flied and I recommend you guys to go</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.260" end="00:03:13.480">...it and those as well?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:13.480" end="00:03:19.300">And, in the last ten fifteen minutes we will do and opencreate a and,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:19.300" end="00:03:23.710">but, as I'm going through my talk if you feel that I'm going to fast or</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23.710" end="00:03:26.800">to slow or if you want me to ask if you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.800" end="00:03:31.180">...specific question about...the features that I'm talking about feel</p>
      <p begin="00:03:31.180" end="00:03:35.960">free to raise your hand and I will try to answer data itself if not then</p>
      <p begin="00:03:35.960" end="00:03:43.930">you can definitely hopefully I will be able to on so all the questions to was the end and ...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:43.930" end="00:03:47.890">Cool so let's talk about you will windows platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47.890" end="00:03:53.180">Lossywhen I was here at build and we talked about windows forty-eight point one platform</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.180" end="00:03:57.980">and shared projects and teddy presented the plan of via he</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.980" end="00:04:03.000">...that of windows...device and, you release the next version of windows we'll have a unify</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.000" end="00:04:05.150">develop a platform and that's what we</p>
      <p begin="00:04:05.150" end="00:04:09.980">have today like finally we have a unify developer platform</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.980" end="00:04:14.210">that works across all windows ten devices whether it's mobile</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14.210" end="00:04:17.530">...desktop xbox coyote</p>
      <p begin="00:04:17.530" end="00:04:21.050">...all the windows and devices all run on windows</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21.050" end="00:04:25.950">stent and that's the create exciting use for a...because finally he</p>
      <p begin="00:04:25.950" end="00:04:30.920">didn't need to think about different versions and different platforms running on different windows</p>
      <p begin="00:04:30.920" end="00:04:35.670">...is a theme when arty platform that runs across all these windows</p>
      <p begin="00:04:35.670" end="00:04:38.420">...devices?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.420" end="00:04:40.900">For windows forty-point one if you guys remember if you</p>
      <p begin="00:04:40.900" end="00:04:45.710">have build application the story was that there was a high degree of conversions but</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.710" end="00:04:49.360">...developers to build...different application package</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:53.410">one application package for windows eight-point one another application package for windows</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53.410" end="00:04:59.410">forty-eight point one and they used to go to...different stores windows to revel of...to...and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.410" end="00:05:04.340">...windows backbone we finally have binary compatibility you can</p>
      <p begin="00:05:04.340" end="00:05:08.960">now use a single project to create a single application package that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:12.490">...across all windows ten device.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12.490" end="00:05:14.030">Said that.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:14.030" end="00:05:17.350">If you have a scenario in mind where you want</p>
      <p begin="00:05:17.350" end="00:05:21.520">a specific package to go to a specific device family as an example</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:26.160">if you want a wmv windows mobile package of just say...package should only go</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:30.510">...windows mobile devices and you can do that as well as part of my</p>
      <p begin="00:05:30.510" end="00:05:37.250">talk I will show you how you how that can be at on how you can do that in visual studio.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:37.250" end="00:05:42.660">Finally if you look in the image...diagram they are the centerpiece is the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:42.660" end="00:05:45.210">...windows platform every</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.210" end="00:05:49.800">api that exist in the universe of windows platform you can use</p>
      <p begin="00:05:49.800" end="00:05:52.460">...and expected to be the on every windows</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52.460" end="00:05:55.510">ten device right so that's the conversions.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56.570" end="00:05:58.900">But,...still some bits and pieces</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58.900" end="00:06:02.990">via the awesome capabilities which are specific to a device family.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.060" end="00:06:07.540">As an example let's think about mobile right there still</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.540" end="00:06:11.460">...phone devices that are running hardware back buttons.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.460" end="00:06:15.960">So, as a developer you need to think about how exactly my application</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.960" end="00:06:18.950">will go and use the capabilities that are specific to</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.950" end="00:06:24.790">a device family and that does the place...will go in the explore what adaptive</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24.790" end="00:06:32.550">...how you can write adaptive code and...look at some demos for that as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:32.550" end="00:06:36.550">So, let's now talk about the supported os for universal windows</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.550" end="00:06:41.330">the development from visual studio perspective we always</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.330" end="00:06:45.260">...developers to be running on the highest version of windows to get the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.260" end="00:06:49.300">best develop experience so-if you want-to go and...universal windows app</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.300" end="00:06:54.180">will encourage you to go and use the latest reduced and fly and installed tools and build</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.180" end="00:06:58.790">your application when you are running on windows ten you can go and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.790" end="00:07:03.730">use any of these deployment targets...can run your application in a simulator</p>
      <p begin="00:07:03.730" end="00:07:08.040">you can rugged your application on the local machine you can use the mobile emulator</p>
      <p begin="00:07:08.040" end="00:07:12.280">...see how your application will work on a phone device you can use the remote</p>
      <p begin="00:07:12.280" end="00:07:14.730">machine scenario to validate your</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.730" end="00:07:18.240">...your application on a remote pc or xbox</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.240" end="00:07:22.690">or an i-device and you can also use a connected phone device</p>
      <p begin="00:07:22.690" end="00:07:26.690">...you do a ipo usb and deploy...application to a hardware</p>
      <p begin="00:07:26.690" end="00:07:33.640">...device right so when you're running on windows...all these deployment targets are supported.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:33.640" end="00:07:37.100">If you are...if you are you doing you are design</p>
      <p begin="00:07:37.100" end="00:07:41.320">...then you can when you're running on windows ten you can use...design out in visual studio and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.320" end="00:07:46.590">lead to actually go and implement...to see how it...application will look lent look,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:46.590" end="00:07:49.550">at the runtime and...design our feature itself.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:07:51.520">But, for the first-time.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:52.790" end="00:07:56.640">Visual studio is novel support universal windows</p>
      <p begin="00:07:56.640" end="00:08:00.420">...development on previously released version of all with as</p>
      <p begin="00:08:00.420" end="00:08:03.880">...right so you can go and install visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:08:03.880" end="00:08:08.670">...thousand fifteen are fee on of windows eight-point one machine and develop</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08.670" end="00:08:12.670">...universal windows app so if you're running on windows eight-point</p>
      <p begin="00:08:12.670" end="00:08:17.400">one because the previous version of os the experience will be slightly degraded</p>
      <p begin="00:08:17.400" end="00:08:21.700">as an example you cannot you will not have simulator and local machine of</p>
      <p begin="00:08:21.700" end="00:08:26.070">the deployment target because you cannot run of windows ten application on windows eight-point</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.070" end="00:08:29.260">...similarly because of download design I have some</p>
      <p begin="00:08:29.260" end="00:08:32.320">dependency that uses the runtime os to give you the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:32.320" end="00:08:36.870">...and to render...am application so example design</p>
      <p begin="00:08:36.870" end="00:08:42.250">...not be of level of any running on a windows eight-point one os</p>
      <p begin="00:08:42.250" end="00:08:45.720">...will instead give you a full example editor view via example</p>
      <p begin="00:08:45.720" end="00:08:52.060">intelligence both for platform and question type and you can use that to build your application.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:52.060" end="00:08:55.720">At...dn will also support building</p>
      <p begin="00:08:55.720" end="00:08:58.500">universal windows app on windows seven</p>
      <p begin="00:08:58.500" end="00:09:02.440">right again because it's a windows seven os hyper v</p>
      <p begin="00:09:02.440" end="00:09:06.920">is not supported so emulator will not work but you will be able to use</p>
      <p begin="00:09:06.920" end="00:09:12.720">remote machine to actually deploy are application on of endorsed and...xbox</p>
      <p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:17.480">...and I ot and you can also use the user connected phone device to deploy</p>
      <p begin="00:09:17.480" end="00:09:23.080">...application onto a for device and...it and debugged.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:23.080" end="00:09:26.820">And, as I mentioned before you will not have them and design experience</p>
      <p begin="00:09:26.820" end="00:09:31.360">in windows seven as well but you will be you able to use...right so the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:37.480">message which of os you are running on what windows seven windows eight-point one of</p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.480" end="00:09:42.360">windows server two the ventral rtwo or windows...you can go and download visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:09:42.360" end="00:09:50.800">are fee...universe of windows tools and start building...application.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:54.690">Now let's talk a little bit about project templates do that let's actually</p>
      <p begin="00:09:54.690" end="00:09:58.270">...is to do so.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:58.270" end="00:10:02.870">The search tvs.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:02.870" end="00:10:06.090">And, if I bring up the new project dialogue here.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:06.090" end="00:10:10.290">You will see that universal windows project template are located</p>
      <p begin="00:10:10.290" end="00:10:15.250">and visual csharp windows and windows universal node.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:15.250" end="00:10:19.330">We have a bank application project template of which you can use</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.330" end="00:10:23.750">a starting point for building your application is an applicant generates</p>
      <p begin="00:10:23.750" end="00:10:28.290">...application package other than that we have a dl</p>
      <p begin="00:10:28.290" end="00:10:33.510">...of an artery project template...unit test project template.</p>

      <p begin="00:11:26.590" end="00:11:31.140">And, I've just use my example application here.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:31.140" end="00:11:34.340">So, once you have created...project and if you bring up the project</p>
      <p begin="00:11:34.340" end="00:11:39.170">properties you will see that we have actually added some new properties</p>
      <p begin="00:11:39.170" end="00:11:43.890">...universal windows up right here you can see that there are two properties</p>
      <p begin="00:11:43.890" end="00:11:49.510">target version admin version if you click here you see the target version combo</p>
      <p begin="00:11:49.510" end="00:11:54.630">...showing multiple as the case it showing one zero six nine</p>
      <p begin="00:11:54.630" end="00:11:59.350">...is zero one zero nine zero right of similarly if you click on a</p>
      <p begin="00:11:59.350" end="00:12:02.230">...version you will see multiple...listed</p>
      <p begin="00:12:02.230" end="00:12:08.450">here as well so what are these properties and how a developer should think about it?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:08.450" end="00:12:13.480">These properties...critical and for-you...up and I will explain</p>
      <p begin="00:12:13.480" end="00:12:18.420">why let's take a look at what exactly is target what exactly is target</p>
      <p begin="00:12:18.420" end="00:12:24.070">of version so the target version property that you see in the project properties is</p>
      <p begin="00:12:24.070" end="00:12:28.500">...by target platform version in your project file if you one of the cs project you will</p>
      <p begin="00:12:28.500" end="00:12:33.150">see target platform version and that's what being it's displayed in the project property what this target</p>
      <p begin="00:12:33.150" end="00:12:36.990">platform version means it defines the worsen of universal as</p>
      <p begin="00:12:36.990" end="00:12:39.560">...your project is being compiled</p>
      <p begin="00:12:39.560" end="00:12:44.710">against right so it defines the api surface that is</p>
      <p begin="00:12:44.710" end="00:12:48.310">...to your project and that's what that target version</p>
      <p begin="00:12:48.310" end="00:12:53.260">indicates think about this as windows good into a servicing model and</p>
      <p begin="00:12:53.260" end="00:12:58.160">start shipping more and more updates they will be different versions of universal windows</p>
      <p begin="00:12:58.160" end="00:13:03.510">educate and different versions of universal windows platform...running on a device so-if you</p>

      <p begin="00:13:08.330" end="00:13:13.320">educate in the project properties you will see the educates to be listed there you can go and</p>
      <p begin="00:13:13.320" end="00:13:18.630">change the target version to the version of...decay you want to use and start using the new</p>

      <p begin="00:13:23.130" end="00:13:26.660">As part of the build process visual studio will automatically</p>
      <p begin="00:13:26.660" end="00:13:31.480">take the target version property and stump it into the manifest file so there's</p>
      <p begin="00:13:31.480" end="00:13:36.110">...property...manifest file which is called target device family which names</p>

      <p begin="00:14:36.860" end="00:14:40.530">The min version is...by target platform inversion property</p>
      <p begin="00:14:40.530" end="00:14:44.730">in the project file and what is signifies that minimum version</p>

      <p begin="00:15:52.940" end="00:15:57.920">you're thinking about universal windows platform when you think about us of windows project and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:02.300">the adaptive code these two properties become very interesting if you have developed</p>
      <p begin="00:16:02.300" end="00:16:07.130">an android app I'm pretty sure you guys...they are they have three different versions but</p>
      <p begin="00:16:07.130" end="00:16:10.800">he was the stories the same make sure these values of set correctly</p>

      <p begin="00:16:18.630" end="00:16:23.990">Now let's talk a little bit about windows device family actuation...case.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:23.990" end="00:16:27.770">So, as I mentioned there is a we have a unify developer platform</p>
      <p begin="00:16:27.770" end="00:16:31.930">what they are still some capabilities that exist specific to</p>
      <p begin="00:16:31.930" end="00:16:37.890">work target device family right and we talked about hardware but...unfold.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:37.890" end="00:16:41.560">For...allow developers to actually use these the api</p>
      <p begin="00:16:41.560" end="00:16:44.780">...use these capabilities which are specific to a</p>
      <p begin="00:16:44.780" end="00:16:48.870">device family we have introduce the concept of device family actuation</p>
      <p begin="00:16:48.870" end="00:16:54.140">...right so let's actually go to...visual studio.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:54.140" end="00:16:56.930">And, take a look at that.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:56.930" end="00:16:59.830">So, for this one and just going to use my...</p>
      <p begin="00:16:59.830" end="00:17:04.770">book application before we a dive into this let's actually just run</p>
      <p begin="00:17:04.770" end="00:17:09.270">the application see what it does for you guys are familiar with it so I will go</p>
      <p begin="00:17:09.270" end="00:17:15.990">...this application on local machine.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.990" end="00:17:20.770">Okay, I'll just try to fix it...enough of...so,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:20.770" end="00:17:25.690">my app is a very simple...application and I can just</p>
      <p begin="00:17:25.690" end="00:17:29.910">go it's basically showing a set of categories here which of advertisers to some</p>
      <p begin="00:17:29.910" end="00:17:33.610">...I can go and click on a specific category and if</p>
      <p begin="00:17:33.610" end="00:17:39.110">we show you a set of recipes for that category and you can click on a recipe and</p>
      <p begin="00:17:39.110" end="00:17:44.280">...you in instructions and ingredients for preparing that recipe?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:44.280" end="00:17:47.480">And, you can click on a...into navigate back</p>
      <p begin="00:17:47.480" end="00:17:52.970">this is actually using adaptive ui so you can go and actually resize the application and you</p>
      <p begin="00:17:52.970" end="00:18:00.040">see it's actually resize it and shows produce issue the right elements of the right layout.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:00.040" end="00:18:05.030">And, I can go back and run this same code on emulator the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:05.030" end="00:18:15.310">same universal single project which I'm not going to go and apply to emulator.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:15.310" end="00:18:20.280">Just to save some time have kept emulate open already and we have the same application</p>
      <p begin="00:18:20.280" end="00:18:23.930">are running on a mobile emulator as well again, I can click on</p>
      <p begin="00:18:23.930" end="00:18:28.150">a category and pretty much works the same way.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:28.150" end="00:18:30.770">So, it's a seeing universal</p>
      <p begin="00:18:30.770" end="00:18:34.220">...working on both bc as well as on mobile...</p>
      <p begin="00:18:34.220" end="00:18:39.150">emulator but now if I go...click on the badminton you will see my application</p>

      <p begin="00:18:52.640" end="00:18:58.700">...how less...fix that for this application and see how that would work so.</p>

      <p begin="00:19:51.930" end="00:19:55.780">And, pretty...exactly works like you have if you have user third-party actuation</p>
      <p begin="00:19:55.780" end="00:19:58.480">educate the workflow is identical just go and add the</p>
      <p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:03.460">difference once you have done that visual studio and microsoft...will automatically find the right contract...</p>

      <p begin="00:20:10.630" end="00:20:15.910">...done added the difference to mobile actuation educate I will go...you wired up my hardware back</p>
      <p begin="00:20:15.910" end="00:20:20.880">...the right the code windows dot phone.</p>

      <p begin="00:20:31.040" end="00:20:35.240">So, as I'm doing it I want to show one of the...features is</p>
      <p begin="00:20:35.240" end="00:20:39.860">the develop a assistant the as decay that is powered by bing</p>
      <p begin="00:20:39.860" end="00:20:44.580">and that's recently we have shipped what this develop assistant...if as</p>
      <p begin="00:20:44.580" end="00:20:49.420">you're writing a using a api it actually uses bing to give you a sample</p>
      <p begin="00:20:49.420" end="00:20:53.780">cord of how this api should be used so here in the example issuing me that you get</p>
      <p begin="00:20:53.780" end="00:20:58.460">...up your hardware back buttons and who might want to go and put it in a</p>
      <p begin="00:20:58.460" end="00:21:06.900">...check and we'll discuss why so I'll just go and what up my?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:06.900" end="00:21:08.470">And, generate ...</p>
      <p begin="00:21:09.900" end="00:21:11.850">So, that's pretty much.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:11.850" end="00:21:12.580">So, if I go</p>
      <p begin="00:21:12.580" end="00:21:20.110">and run this code rightnow on local machine what will happen anyone.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:20.110" end="00:21:27.820">It will crash why do crash.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:27.820" end="00:21:31.440">Exactly so that's what he mention if I run the same code</p>
      <p begin="00:21:31.440" end="00:21:35.960">on local machine my application will crash right now because.</p>

      <p begin="00:45:11.800" end="00:45:15.490">here I would pass the additional data...let's see categories.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:16.790" end="00:45:21.050">Because we are tracking which specific categories wasp clicked by the u up</p>
      <p begin="00:45:22.370" end="00:45:26.810">the most popular category and I will positive category that the developer has</p>

      <p begin="00:45:33.220" end="00:45:37.910">Close this I need to...the...and affect.</p>

      <p begin="00:45:44.470" end="00:45:54.360">So, that's pretty much it...go and run this application again.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:54.360" end="00:45:58.590">Now let's go and click on a category let's say let's.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:58.590" end="00:46:03.970">Convex...individual portal.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:03.970" end="00:46:13.910">And, go back to the application.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:13.910" end="00:46:17.560">And, here just telling me all the custom events that I'm tracking</p>
      <p begin="00:46:17.560" end="00:46:22.400">...using on navigate to for cracking the events.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:22.400" end="00:46:25.900">And, if I go to the diagnostic search as well it should</p>

      <p begin="00:46:37.150" end="00:46:41.820">...categories was bread and the application development so it's like just</p>
      <p begin="00:46:41.820" end="00:46:47.330">was a single-line afford I was able to hook up my ...custom event using the app</p>
      <p begin="00:46:47.330" end="00:46:50.800">...and you can see its get issues in within a thirteen-fifteen</p>
      <p begin="00:46:50.800" end="00:46:55.070">seconds it gets populated in the...even less than like fifteen twenty seconds get</p>
      <p begin="00:46:55.070" end="00:47:00.360">...portal so that's one thing I would strongly recommend if you care about adding telemetry</p>
      <p begin="00:47:00.360" end="00:47:10.090">...app...size and try using this for...us lap.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:10.090" end="00:47:16.380">So, we...already look at a custom events one final thing I want to go and talk about</p>
      <p begin="00:47:16.380" end="00:47:21.140">is the how you should think about if you already building and existing windows eight-point one of windows phone</p>
      <p begin="00:47:21.140" end="00:47:25.540">eight-point one application how you should think about building a new windows universal</p>
      <p begin="00:47:25.540" end="00:47:30.720">...right and there's a couple of different proposals which I think...develop I can think about</p>
      <p begin="00:47:31.910" end="00:47:37.570">...first proposal if you already have an existing application I am pretty sure that you want</p>
      <p begin="00:47:37.570" end="00:47:42.150">to go and maintain those existing applications to target the existing device windows</p>
      <p begin="00:47:42.150" end="00:47:45.150">...and window...device.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:45.150" end="00:47:49.670">...you can do is you can go and add a new universal project right and</p>
      <p begin="00:47:49.670" end="00:47:55.570">this universal project will be for all windows ten divisive that you want to target you can use</p>
      <p begin="00:47:55.570" end="00:48:00.050">adaptive poured to go and check for device specific capabilities and right</p>
      <p begin="00:48:00.050" end="00:48:01.840">codec is that.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:01.840" end="00:48:05.290">You can use adaptive ui that you can go and talk about if you</p>
      <p begin="00:48:05.290" end="00:48:09.060">...learning one-in-ten chechen but you can use adaptive ui to have the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:09.060" end="00:48:12.770">form factors and to make sure you have the right design and running on the right form</p>
      <p begin="00:48:12.770" end="00:48:16.430">facto and you can use shared projects when...components</p>
      <p begin="00:48:16.430" end="00:48:21.290">portable class libraries and dls...the code between all different versions</p>
      <p begin="00:48:21.290" end="00:48:26.590">...can use all them to share corbin...that one-one windows phone equal one...universal project</p>
      <p begin="00:48:26.590" end="00:48:32.300">...this solution you are basically maintaining three different packages...of...that</p>
      <p begin="00:48:32.300" end="00:48:39.010">...windows forty-eight point one and one for the universal package that target all windows ten device.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:39.010" end="00:48:43.910">Now if you going care about specifically about creating a package which is</p>
      <p begin="00:48:43.910" end="00:48:47.800">a specific to of windows ten device family an example</p>
      <p begin="00:48:47.800" end="00:48:52.950">because some constraints you want a specific package to go form windows mobile...different package</p>
      <p begin="00:48:52.950" end="00:48:58.050">to go on rest of the devices you can still do that to do it you will go</p>
      <p begin="00:48:58.050" end="00:49:02.420">and, again, create a new universal project in your value-added</p>
      <p begin="00:49:02.420" end="00:49:07.040">...is a project your solution you would open up the manifest file and</p>
      <p begin="00:49:07.040" end="00:49:11.310">chains the target device family from windows dot universal to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:11.310" end="00:49:16.050">windows dot mobile site and then specify the min version and a</p>
      <p begin="00:49:16.050" end="00:49:21.010">...tested value for windows dot mobile device family</p>
      <p begin="00:49:21.010" end="00:49:25.860">and these values will be published by windows on msdn so you will goal</p>
      <p begin="00:49:25.860" end="00:49:29.140">do msdn and you will see what other current versions of...mobile that are</p>
      <p begin="00:49:29.140" end="00:49:31.640">...the market use that values and</p>
      <p begin="00:49:31.640" end="00:49:35.200">...manifest file and then your package which is going to be created</p>
      <p begin="00:49:35.200" end="00:49:39.900">...only be applicable for windows mobile device family and will not be applicable for</p>
      <p begin="00:49:39.900" end="00:49:46.190">...like desktop riled unixbox if...going target wrestler devices you can create yet</p>
      <p begin="00:49:46.190" end="00:49:51.380">another windows universal project which is targeting for rest of the divisive and then you shared projects</p>
      <p begin="00:49:51.380" end="00:49:55.510">...components and dls to share the code between them so in this case I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:49:55.510" end="00:49:59.410">building to packages for targeting windows...one of the universal</p>
      <p begin="00:49:59.410" end="00:50:03.920">...that goes to xbox coyote and every other device and there's one package which</p>
      <p begin="00:50:03.920" end="00:50:07.040">is specifically being built for windows dot mobile</p>
      <p begin="00:50:07.040" end="00:50:12.610">devices right so when these packages go to store if a consumers downloading</p>
      <p begin="00:50:12.610" end="00:50:17.420">our app and he's running mobile the store will automatically push the mobile version of</p>
      <p begin="00:50:17.420" end="00:50:21.750">your application package if is running on desktop the store will push</p>
      <p begin="00:50:21.750" end="00:50:26.160">the desktop version other windows are universal version of the application packets to the device the</p>
      <p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:29.970">...is already capable of doing that that's the way you will be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:50:29.970" end="00:50:35.420">author package specific to a device family?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:35.420" end="00:50:35.750">These</p>
      <p begin="00:50:35.750" end="00:50:40.960">...resources I already talked about windows samples in on the get tab also</p>
      <p begin="00:50:40.960" end="00:50:45.930">that for developers assistant you can go...downloaded directly from</p>
      <p begin="00:50:45.930" end="00:50:50.650">...have a dev assistant and go and try it to get some sample code</p>
      <p begin="00:50:50.650" end="00:50:54.430">...itself and uniting code.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:54.430" end="00:50:58.020">Finally the registrations one of the key</p>
      <p begin="00:50:58.020" end="00:51:02.100">...that we're going to we are doing for universe of windows platform</p>
      <p begin="00:51:02.100" end="00:51:06.430">is using dot net native right and the that making you dot net</p>

      <p begin="00:51:11.060" end="00:51:15.600">are lot-of implications on the developer workflow itself to have a deep dive of how</p>
      <p begin="00:51:15.600" end="00:51:19.620">exactly dot tentative works only my manager is going to basically</p>
      <p begin="00:51:19.620" end="00:51:24.580">...tomorrow on ad strongly recommend you guys to go and at</p>
      <p begin="00:51:24.580" end="00:51:29.860">induction because it's going to...the...exactly should think about dot net native</p>
      <p begin="00:51:29.860" end="00:51:32.740">...building...up you also have another</p>
      <p begin="00:51:32.740" end="00:51:37.170">session on sample tools are he's going to talk about more about what I've actually</p>
      <p begin="00:51:37.170" end="00:51:42.360">got a new tools and new profiling tools that we have enabled...to support</p>
      <p begin="00:51:42.360" end="00:51:48.140">...platforms a couple of other interesting issues the adaptive you I already talked about which is being done by</p>
      <p begin="00:51:48.140" end="00:51:53.110">tim and finally the seven forty-one...and the sam jar one on friday</p>
      <p begin="00:51:53.110" end="00:51:58.200">we'll go and explain what exactly the migration process for windows eight-point one to</p>

      <p begin="00:52:09.410" end="00:52:11.630">dive of how exactly what are the api changes one of</p>
      <p begin="00:52:11.630" end="00:52:16.620">the manifest changes how you structure project and, going to detail of that so</p>
      <p begin="00:52:16.620" end="00:52:22.340">...definitely commend you to go in it and attrition as well.</p>

      <p begin="00:53:16.950" end="00:53:21.520">...this continue prisms butthis is outside my team so I...have to follow of</p>
      <p begin="00:53:21.520" end="00:53:31.650">...at least not heard the applying to unsupported yep.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:31.650" end="00:53:34.120">So, the data gets pop so,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:34.120" end="00:53:38.900">the question is what happens if the app inside...the client is not really connected I think so</p>
      <p begin="00:53:38.900" end="00:53:43.090">what their mechanism is that the collected and deleted push it and up so I</p>
      <p begin="00:53:43.090" end="00:53:53.410">that I would expect that to be the...that's the key that...collect the data later on...</p>
      <p begin="00:53:53.410" end="00:54:00.200">And, references...the source code okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:00.200" end="00:54:07.350">...let's actually going to look at it.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:07.350" end="00:54:11.480">So, right...using dot net frameworks open five-point-one and the</p>
      <p begin="00:54:11.480" end="00:54:16.970">...framework itself is kind of evolving right now with all open-source and avi...also thinking about how</p>
      <p begin="00:54:16.970" end="00:54:21.860">...to actually big dot net framework so that it actually can...a muscle faced a faster</p>
      <p begin="00:54:21.860" end="00:54:26.980">cadence so there's still a little bit of a evolution going for dot net framework but right now</p>
      <p begin="00:54:26.980" end="00:54:30.830">it's using four-point-five...one it's possible that at rem we</p>
      <p begin="00:54:30.830" end="00:54:35.000">baking that into like one...thing that you're looking into is it possible to break the</p>
      <p begin="00:54:35.000" end="00:54:38.410">...framework into a set of new get packages...can go and</p>
      <p begin="00:54:38.410" end="00:54:43.140">reference so there's going to be core set but if you want to go and user specific new we are</p>
      <p begin="00:54:43.140" end="00:54:56.100">...api might have...sununu get packages that actually goes and that's what it.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:56.100" end="00:54:57.240">This is basically thing</p>
      <p begin="00:54:57.240" end="00:55:02.120">...application that's what it's a it's basically targeting a dot net framework this is a</p>
      <p begin="00:55:02.120" end="00:55:06.670">behaviors educate which is a third-party actualize decay that...in my demo for using</p>
      <p begin="00:55:06.670" end="00:55:11.390">behavior right these are the mobile actually...decay is the platform</p>
      <p begin="00:55:11.390" end="00:55:16.280">actualize...because I want to use the hardware back but and that's what is being used for</p>
      <p begin="00:55:16.280" end="00:55:20.020">...and then these are all the new get packages which are being used for app</p>
      <p begin="00:55:20.020" end="00:55:25.420">and sayce to actually collect the data and...your photos...you these all app insights are the</p>
      <p begin="00:55:25.420" end="00:55:31.370">you get packages the app insights...used users for collecting...metric.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:31.370" end="00:55:36.880">And, this is a another you get package that I'm using for parsing my data sample data</p>
      <p begin="00:55:36.880" end="00:55:40.860">...in the application that the new does jason.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:40.860" end="00:55:45.450">It's basically...it's a universal application that...that's...yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:45.450" end="00:56:01.220">this is because it's a universal application that the...showing it think that's on...</p>
      <p begin="00:56:01.220" end="00:56:01.570">Okay,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:01.570" end="00:56:06.550">I can give the...answer and when he was going to go...dive into it...give you a short on</p>
      <p begin="00:56:06.550" end="00:56:12.610">for here if you look into this we actually don't have any cpu any longer</p>
      <p begin="00:56:12.610" end="00:56:17.220">supported in the managed applications so the only you have to actually go</p>
      <p begin="00:56:17.220" end="00:56:23.310">and indicate...the manage application there's no any cpu they are going to be exited</p>
      <p begin="00:56:23.310" end="00:56:28.300">...on which is true for cplus-plus when you ability your application and when you building an application</p>
      <p begin="00:56:28.300" end="00:56:33.870">packets you have to specifically target...if you're building a library</p>
      <p begin="00:56:33.870" end="00:56:38.100">because still...any cpu library that...just go and when you get</p>
      <p begin="00:56:38.100" end="00:56:43.150">a diffusion application package vision the configuration of that application package it will go and build</p>
      <p begin="00:56:43.150" end="00:56:52.940">...that so yes?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:52.940" end="00:56:58.230">So, the question is how it works is basically when you go so,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:58.230" end="00:57:02.820">when you build your...you go and upload your package right...when you upload the package it's</p>

      <p begin="01:01:09.900" end="01:01:14.900">final plan but we have taken the steps to go into that direction and one of the step is basically shipping</p>
