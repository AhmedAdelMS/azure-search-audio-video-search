      <p begin="00:01:07.910" end="00:01:14.110">he's so excited to be here so,...why do we need that model and then what the heck</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.110" end="00:01:16.620">...that model and go through that and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.620" end="00:01:20.790">...I like this guy so much here is get look?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:20.790" end="00:01:23.540">Why do we...model he looks pretty hangs</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.540" end="00:01:30.310">...not quite sure and it's pretty important to think about why we need that model?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.310" end="00:01:30.810">Because.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.000" end="00:01:43.200">It makes the clicker work.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:43.200" end="00:01:46.400">What this is why we're not shipping clearly so there</p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.400" end="00:01:47.760">...are aiff?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.860" end="00:01:51.500">So, ...why do we need that model and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.500" end="00:01:56.140">yet windows is never really had a definition of what app is</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.140" end="00:02:00.800">you kinda know what it is when you see it but nobody can really put the finger on what it is</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.800" end="00:02:06.640">we space we started with the next...but what about how you install it what the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:06.640" end="00:02:12.290">am you there's lots of different ways I've been a microsoft twenty years and I'm responsible for some of them and I</p>
      <p begin="00:02:12.290" end="00:02:14.800">apologize for that.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.800" end="00:02:16.840">How...still stay?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.840" end="00:02:19.430">You know, what how long does your</p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.430" end="00:02:23.450">aff wrongful that traditionally windows that's not really been a problem to as</p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.450" end="00:02:27.280">...go as well as universal man we're running from my achieved through the phones</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:32.450">...hollow lenses how long does the whole graph law need to run for is</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.450" end="00:02:36.030">important things and how do you integrate the os how do we integrate with your applications?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:37.350" end="00:02:39.870">And, then finally what can you and do?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.870" end="00:02:48.260">So, the app model provides answers to these questions hopefully you'll like</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.260" end="00:02:50.720">So, what is the when the uw</p>
      <p begin="00:02:50.720" end="00:02:56.590">p windows that model well it defines the act life-cycle and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.590" end="00:03:01.800">...unify across all of the windows devices used sorrell...great demos today</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.800" end="00:03:07.330">...signed up so you can google your hologram but, it's important...be able to scale from</p>
      <p begin="00:03:07.330" end="00:03:10.190">...will...reply to all the way up through a</p>
      <p begin="00:03:10.190" end="00:03:14.860">...and xbox...the and pc and we want to do it in such a way that</p>
      <p begin="00:03:14.860" end="00:03:19.560">...not taking the lowest common denominator if all you could do was run</p>
      <p begin="00:03:19.560" end="00:03:23.040">...sense essentially what you can run a variety device on the pc, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:27.940">can be pretty happy you're not going to be happy, you know,...to build the applications you want to be able to do so</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.940" end="00:03:32.500">...model the scales what you want to be able to do if you wanted to run</p>
      <p begin="00:03:32.500" end="00:03:37.170">...devices then at some point you have to make a tradeoff is like okay well shoot</p>
      <p begin="00:03:37.170" end="00:03:41.270">...run on the phone there's only so much memory is available to me that...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.270" end="00:03:46.260">great if I was running on a pc or high-end phone...showing the continuum those</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.260" end="00:03:50.660">phones are pretty cooling the amazing things like if I have a two-a-three gig phone</p>
      <p begin="00:03:50.660" end="00:03:53.620">...I should be able to my app should be able to scale-up and do whatever</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.620" end="00:04:00.270">...do on that yet also go down to run on the five hundred twelve megabyte...</p>
      <p begin="00:04:00.270" end="00:04:03.360">So, we like to think...app model is the kind of cradle to grave</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.360" end="00:04:07.240">...we install you we run you and, you know, eventually you'll get</p>
      <p begin="00:04:07.240" end="00:04:11.570">on install hopefully that doesn't happen that often but, you know, is important to be</p>
      <p begin="00:04:11.570" end="00:04:15.030">able to do that and one of the key things that we all forget?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:16.060" end="00:04:19.550">How...to do is being...update your application</p>
      <p begin="00:04:19.550" end="00:04:24.680">here we've had ways to install applications we've had ways to unsold but we've all had the update</p>
      <p begin="00:04:24.680" end="00:04:28.150">experiences like well you're restart machines so you can update this program</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.150" end="00:04:32.520">well we'll frankly no never I never want to restart my machine</p>
      <p begin="00:04:32.520" end="00:04:37.000">how can be able to update the specialise...thinking about distributing these action</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.000" end="00:04:41.900">the store I want that stores...what they I wanna-be kept up today I don't want to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.900" end="00:04:46.890">wake up in the morning...of my pc and this is waiting with usc...saying well hey, you know, I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:46.890" end="00:04:53.880">update this app that's the last thing you want to do when you install when you get up in the morning so?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53.880" end="00:04:56.730">The our app model inclusive all apps the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.730" end="00:05:01.100">...windows have universal windows...and that's really, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:01.100" end="00:05:04.980">that's where we're going that feature and, clearly</p>
      <p begin="00:05:04.980" end="00:05:09.910">...to do that but we have to run existing applications we have to be able to run phone</p>
      <p begin="00:05:09.910" end="00:05:15.830">...windows eight-point one-x windows a microsoft but, we also have to run classic windows</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.930" end="00:05:21.720">...what the heck are classic windows apps that you and I probably know those as when</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.720" end="00:05:27.120">...you might know them is wpf...forms that dot net.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:29.650">But, we try to come up with the term.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:29.650" end="00:05:33.640">That kind of encompass the all those applications and really</p>
      <p begin="00:05:33.640" end="00:05:37.500">kinda celebrated the greatness...many of us here why do you how we</p>
      <p begin="00:05:37.500" end="00:05:41.860">...career frankly the...million programs are at the apps</p>
      <p begin="00:05:41.860" end="00:05:48.200">...at the on windows today so, what classing those...classic windows apps?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.200" end="00:05:49.300">And, if...this</p>
      <p begin="00:05:49.300" end="00:05:54.360">...today but...introducing products and tenet price centennial is the ability</p>
      <p begin="00:05:54.360" end="00:05:59.380">...convert your classic windows app written more everyone was so excited</p>
      <p begin="00:05:59.380" end="00:06:03.370">...created the to the twitter tag for it so see w apps</p>
      <p begin="00:06:03.370" end="00:06:07.390">...now I did so...at tag that some of the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.390" end="00:06:16.670">reason ones were taken by things we didn't want so keen on so to universal windows...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.670" end="00:06:20.040">These guys so excited he brought his dog.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:20.040" end="00:06:24.070">This developer heats can hubby contains excitement dog looks a little</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24.070" end="00:06:27.530">...must be said but so, when we think</p>
      <p begin="00:06:27.530" end="00:06:32.440">about product centennial I'm thinking about how do we bring those windows apps and how</p>
      <p begin="00:06:32.440" end="00:06:37.180">we bring them kind of kicking and screaming into the twenty first-century so they don't screw up your</p>
      <p begin="00:06:37.180" end="00:06:41.190">machine so really it comes down to?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.190" end="00:06:45.990">Defining and...model for classic windows x until now the really has</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.990" end="00:06:50.560">to be no definition of an app on windows I think bill gates wants</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:55.610">...somebody consumer money that they couldn't define what windows apples and,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:55.610" end="00:06:58.500">frankly I think...to has the money so</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.500" end="00:07:05.130">we've been lots of attempts to do it but never systemic definition so that's</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.130" end="00:07:09.800">what it centennial sets out to do to enable you to run your applications and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:09.800" end="00:07:14.500">you'll have to make some code changes in many cases hardly any coaches at all not go over</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.500" end="00:07:16.140">...second to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:16.140" end="00:07:20.370">bring your application into the universe windows platform</p>
      <p begin="00:07:20.370" end="00:07:29.180">...you can distribute...we can distributive...the mechanisms you have today.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:30.250" end="00:07:32.290">Why now why do we that model</p>
      <p begin="00:07:32.290" end="00:07:35.570">for desktop today in reality is windows</p>
      <p begin="00:07:35.570" end="00:07:41.280">...we've all experienced we've all...technicals for colds a family member</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.280" end="00:07:45.710">...I didn't do anything and my pc the work now and?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:45.710" end="00:07:53.220">His I've got...twelve...and I didn't do anything it just showed up.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:53.220" end="00:07:57.870">Maybe they just showed up...the installed application that kind of change in</p>
      <p begin="00:07:57.870" end="00:08:02.670">...we've all done that they downloaded something from you</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02.670" end="00:08:06.800">have some of the websites where there's like sixteen buttons that say download</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:11.150">...of them the actually to download the act your trying to get so thing with the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:11.150" end="00:08:15.110">experiences pretty awful from user perspective.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:15.110" end="00:08:18.530">But, when you start...stony application assume is not chaining in some mal</p>
      <p begin="00:08:18.530" end="00:08:23.440">...something terrible even if the app is trying to do the right thing?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:23.440" end="00:08:27.820">The vast majority of windows wrought like why's my pc slowing down I</p>
      <p begin="00:08:27.820" end="00:08:30.280">...couple of applications that...the...of my</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30.280" end="00:08:34.910">pc is running it takes twenty-second longer startup I'm not even running</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.910" end="00:08:38.240">any apps is because of registry growth and fragmentation.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:39.600" end="00:08:42.060">Think about how much.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:42.060" end="00:08:44.920">Reads how many registry entries mace he local machine you</p>
      <p begin="00:08:44.920" end="00:08:49.640">right kinda hafta...frankly...being here twenty years is</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.640" end="00:08:54.500">...awful,... controlled you have to write...local machine what does the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:54.500" end="00:08:57.850">...local machine is loaded up as soon as you is levin the memory when you</p>
      <p begin="00:08:57.850" end="00:09:02.520">please pc boots so...pc boo time is, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:02.520" end="00:09:06.080">a lot of it comes down to how big is your how is how big is</p>
      <p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:08.430">...local machine?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.430" end="00:09:13.320">So, as...bigger and bigger becomes more difficult and becomes more a</p>
      <p begin="00:09:13.320" end="00:09:14.160">...slower.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.230" end="00:09:15.990">And, then finally.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:17.090" end="00:09:21.220">How many you written on this tool is or try to understand...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.220" end="00:09:24.530">How many you manage to do it one hundred-percent of the time</p>
      <p begin="00:09:24.530" end="00:09:28.640">is almost impossible to do doesn't matter how hard you try you try to really,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:32.890">really hot and, you know, frankly the sem maps that we don't try that hard</p>
      <p begin="00:09:32.890" end="00:09:36.640">...but even if you are trying to do the right thing</p>
      <p begin="00:09:36.640" end="00:09:40.120">it's gone difficult to do?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:40.120" end="00:09:42.420">And, then finally n assign.</p>

      <p begin="00:09:44.540" end="00:09:46.570">And, any of this is where my</p>
      <p begin="00:09:46.570" end="00:09:50.980">...come back to what me because I used to be the javascript pm.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:50.980" end="00:09:56.050">In a full long long-time ago and,...like hey msi guys would be great if you</p>
      <p begin="00:09:56.050" end="00:10:01.260">would scripts and...because like I...script everywhere well turns out that was a bad idea...was might, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:01.260" end="00:10:05.630">so, I get to fix that so ...executable code</p>

      <p begin="00:10:31.360" end="00:10:36.150">The primary thing if you think about is the...is now a deployment model</p>

      <p begin="00:13:03.870" end="00:13:10.960">...typically what I guess...going to do this but like there's going to have someone?</p>

      <p begin="00:13:24.790" end="00:13:29.110">so in many respects if you're if you're app is essentially just</p>
      <p begin="00:13:29.110" end="00:13:33.640">...then you shouldn't really have to change anything.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:33.640" end="00:13:36.980">What...not going to allow and...installs?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:38.330" end="00:13:38.630">Things</p>
      <p begin="00:13:38.630" end="00:13:44.730">that system components what specifically services and drivers.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:44.730" end="00:13:47.190">When we when you install is that when you install</p>
      <p begin="00:13:47.190" end="00:13:50.230">...it becomes almost impossible to update</p>
      <p begin="00:13:50.230" end="00:13:55.180">this how many of us of like you're trying to updated driver without reboot</p>
      <p begin="00:13:55.180" end="00:14:00.000">and we've been trying for a long-time to get that to work in reality we know</p>
      <p begin="00:14:00.000" end="00:14:05.410">...work in terms of being able to make it easy to write a driver be able to updated</p>
      <p begin="00:14:05.410" end="00:14:10.360">we also want to running as a driver doesn't matter how much we isolate you from the</p>

      <p begin="00:14:11.280" end="00:14:16.270">you you've got full access to machine you in the kernel potentially that point?</p>
      <p begin="00:14:16.270" end="00:14:19.080">That is not what we want applications to</p>
      <p begin="00:14:19.080" end="00:14:23.930">...that's not to say you can't take advantage of...the...you get</p>
      <p begin="00:14:23.930" end="00:14:28.830">...is from windows update windows update knows transfer rollback...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:28.830" end="00:14:33.830">rollback process for...much more complicated and frankly</p>
      <p begin="00:14:33.830" end="00:14:38.410">...have a huge impact on...machine and rather than trying to make adtext the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:38.410" end="00:14:42.130">...mandel and trying to deliver all different types of components</p>
      <p begin="00:14:42.130" end="00:14:44.570">...saying look windows up...to deal with</p>
      <p begin="00:14:44.570" end="00:14:49.110">...in those have to deal with services let me do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:49.110" end="00:14:51.340">But, for applications we all</p>
      <p begin="00:14:51.340" end="00:14:55.130">...two-run...just not going to just not going to deliver those</p>
      <p begin="00:14:55.130" end="00:15:00.740">...services and...from that.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:00.740" end="00:15:05.900">Second one and this is frankly the biggest perhaps should be the first is the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:05.900" end="00:15:09.040">no admin elevation the last thing a</p>
      <p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:14.460">use ever wanted frankly was downs of usc...maybe the whole will</p>
      <p begin="00:15:14.460" end="00:15:20.230">...also be usc fromthink about if you're going to put these acts in the stole.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:20.230" end="00:15:23.430">The store updates at three o'clock in the morning...whenever the right</p>
      <p begin="00:15:23.430" end="00:15:29.240">...time to go do that if it has to...you ac privileges it's awful...point</p>
      <p begin="00:15:29.240" end="00:15:34.000">one the user experience is not going to water...frankly...have admin access then,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:34.000" end="00:15:38.880">you know, you can kinda do everything you want to the device so</p>
      <p begin="00:15:38.880" end="00:15:42.740">by not elevating to admin you get to installment per user</p>
      <p begin="00:15:42.740" end="00:15:47.310">basis makes a low easy to install and this will replication the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:47.310" end="00:15:51.250">great thing about fx...if you have more than one usual machine they've</p>
      <p begin="00:15:51.250" end="00:15:54.630">...solder application and the second user logs and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:54.630" end="00:15:59.970">then all it's going to do is basically just register a your application it doesn't have to</p>
      <p begin="00:15:59.970" end="00:16:04.830">...again we have single instance...is going to be able to take advantage of that</p>
      <p begin="00:16:04.830" end="00:16:11.450">you get all the benefits without the downsides of to...a do admin privileges.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:11.450" end="00:16:16.100">The other thing...because we're doing is registry isolation</p>
      <p begin="00:16:16.100" end="00:16:20.180">is impresses extensibility so some examples of that if</p>
      <p begin="00:16:20.180" end="00:16:24.850">your application relies on other applications registering with</p>
      <p begin="00:16:24.850" end="00:16:26.610">this for...for extensibility</p>
      <p begin="00:16:27.760" end="00:16:32.340">...at the moment this year those other applications wagons can't come</p>
      <p begin="00:16:32.340" end="00:16:37.830">from the store you can still do them you can still load them in your application and that's great and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:37.830" end="00:16:42.460">we're very money we showed photoshop...is pretty done important photoshop we intend to</p>
      <p begin="00:16:42.460" end="00:16:47.240">make that available later on this is not going to be available this year but if</p>
      <p begin="00:16:47.240" end="00:16:51.360">...application installs browse help projects heaven help us if it does</p>
      <p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:56.600">...then those...work you can try and register them but they're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:16:56.600" end="00:17:00.980">register the in the...what you think is registry...we</p>
      <p begin="00:17:00.980" end="00:17:05.960">...rice's somewhere else in space for not going to see that your application is</p>
      <p begin="00:17:05.960" end="00:17:10.600">the as registered for that we believe this is a step forward for use we</p>
      <p begin="00:17:10.600" end="00:17:15.020">want to make applications isolated we want we want to make sure the single units</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.020" end="00:17:19.740">the easily updated and maintain will mean that people will</p>
      <p begin="00:17:19.740" end="00:17:23.280">...a lot more happy and what more willing to</p>
      <p begin="00:17:23.280" end="00:17:26.720">...replication because they kinda know what's going to happen when...from</p>
      <p begin="00:17:26.720" end="00:17:32.530">and affects is going to install...never have to regret installing your application that...online</p>
      <p begin="00:17:32.530" end="00:17:37.640">...might get some buyer's regret they don't like it but I don't like...known exactly the same</p>
      <p begin="00:17:37.640" end="00:17:41.430">...they will before and this is vital so this is why this is why</p>
      <p begin="00:17:41.430" end="00:17:49.320">we're denying these currently to ensure that?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:49.320" end="00:17:54.050">So, tamar there's an indep session for a whole hour with john sheehan who is</p>
      <p begin="00:17:54.050" end="00:18:02.120">...distinguish engineers around here somewhere will go into this in much more detail.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:02.120" end="00:18:05.600">So, that's project centennial which is like bringing.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:05.600" end="00:18:10.090">Classic windows apps into epics.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.090" end="00:18:13.640">What about getting...what about getting a clicker works all right</p>
      <p begin="00:18:13.640" end="00:18:20.410">...okay so you...user promises...</p>
      <p begin="00:18:20.410" end="00:18:24.820">and but where do I get my application from well look we still want to store to be</p>
      <p begin="00:18:24.820" end="00:18:29.810">the default place to do that from a consumer perspective is just...easier</p>
      <p begin="00:18:29.810" end="00:18:34.670">more trustworthy place and the experience is significantly better they don't get</p>
      <p begin="00:18:34.670" end="00:18:40.110">...give trying to get...download all manner of stuff the note</p>

      <p begin="00:18:44.060" end="00:18:49.340">...but we also realize you want to have flexible deployment</p>
      <p begin="00:18:49.340" end="00:18:53.370">in the preceding get where it was by having a store</p>
      <p begin="00:18:53.370" end="00:18:57.640">...you them from installing applications so we're going to enable</p>
      <p begin="00:18:57.640" end="00:19:02.880">you to do flexible deployment so that you can take...that you can side</p>

      <p begin="00:19:10.300" end="00:19:15.300">then finally the adtext improvements and there's a whole set from the epics improvements we</p>
