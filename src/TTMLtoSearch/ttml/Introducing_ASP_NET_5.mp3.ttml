      <p begin="00:02:22.650" end="00:02:28.220">our team about two or three months after that said we know a lot of folks are building web</p>
      <p begin="00:02:28.220" end="00:02:33.270">...today and even if you're not...five and you're still usingin the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:33.270" end="00:02:34.460">cfive.</p>

      <p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:46.500">as well and we're...to scroll through and show a couple these is a blog post up on</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.500" end="00:02:51.330">...web the blog...you go there you can read all these changes there's some bugs in</p>
      <p begin="00:02:51.330" end="00:02:57.100">...twenty fifteen rc imagine that there's work-arounds for the bugs in this blog post as</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.100" end="00:03:00.650">well as the biggest thing is we did</p>
      <p begin="00:03:00.650" end="00:03:05.130">...support so even if you using web forms are in the cfive.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.130" end="00:03:09.880">...api to you get all the new csharp all-new vb features this is</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.880" end="00:03:14.130">actually really cool here's a blurry screenshot here this is a</p>
      <p begin="00:03:14.130" end="00:03:19.510">web forms page...seven there is using a new roslyn.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:19.510" end="00:03:23.360">Csharp language feature so there are cool</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23.360" end="00:03:27.780">and interesting stuff happening web form...got a sank model pining with</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.780" end="00:03:31.970">...all the http to...running on system web which are</p>
      <p begin="00:03:31.970" end="00:03:37.960">...cfive jan and search they get ...they get</p>
      <p begin="00:03:37.960" end="00:03:44.150">...should be to supports, yeah,actually...model...for web forms so anybody...building</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.150" end="00:03:49.460">...the current...there is love for those bits in this release don't forget that as well and we do know</p>
      <p begin="00:03:49.460" end="00:03:54.390">that's a little bit confusing that it feels like the number five is a greater number</p>
      <p begin="00:03:54.390" end="00:03:58.860">than four-point-six but it is a parallel track it's the difference</p>
      <p begin="00:03:58.860" end="00:04:03.770">in for framework and the core framework we'll talk about those differences as we get into little more</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.770" end="00:04:09.820">detail but I just...make us understand that it's been a four-six kind of makes the world</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.820" end="00:04:14.790">...as a lot of really cool stuff happening so, this is happening in parallel right.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14.790" end="00:04:20.600">Okay, let's talk about asking at five ...I don't...of...today we have lots of demos and we...a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:20.600" end="00:04:23.460">time on slides...you want to talk about some of the design</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.460" end="00:04:28.220">...but a around estimate five one of them is we totally modular we build</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.220" end="00:04:34.350">...dot net back in the day the idea there was...the kitchen-sink in here</p>
      <p begin="00:04:34.350" end="00:04:39.010">and have every feature turned on by default because we're trying to bring web developers from</p>
      <p begin="00:04:39.010" end="00:04:43.320">our desktop developers into web and we would make a simple</p>
      <p begin="00:04:43.320" end="00:04:48.030">as possible now we move for the future and now we...make web apps as fast as</p>
      <p begin="00:04:48.030" end="00:04:51.910">...so now you can turn on our office</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.910" end="00:04:57.690">...you want and will show that the demos another thing is...network for the cloud and,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:57.690" end="00:05:00.870">microsoft and we...make it even easier...to take</p>
      <p begin="00:05:00.870" end="00:05:04.520">...application in publisher to add your inhabit work when you use</p>
      <p begin="00:05:04.520" end="00:05:09.540">features like scale-up and scale down and stuff like that so there's some sort of changes in the framework to do</p>
      <p begin="00:05:09.540" end="00:05:15.190">you with this faster development cycle on my machine building and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.190" end="00:05:17.660">...five app...a web forms app</p>
      <p begin="00:05:17.660" end="00:05:22.950">...change and recompile and stuff is like a second cycle?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.950" end="00:05:28.340">We've got that down to two seconds right now on estimate five and we think we maybe can even</p>
      <p begin="00:05:28.340" end="00:05:33.640">those...the future I'm going to...everybody my laptop has been head every version visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:05:33.640" end="00:05:37.840">...for like the last six months...fast even with...five</p>
      <p begin="00:05:37.840" end="00:05:42.760">...couple generations old but if you download the rc you should see the two-second thing that we're talking</p>
      <p begin="00:05:42.760" end="00:05:48.590">about right cross-platform so...you can buildings pfive application you can run it on</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.590" end="00:05:53.380">windows mac and linux because of that that's why you see this choose your editors</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.380" end="00:05:57.840">and tools above so one of the things we're going to show today a little bit of an essential lot more</p>
      <p begin="00:05:57.840" end="00:05:59.750">on friday is pretty much anything</p>
      <p begin="00:05:59.750" end="00:06:04.640">you can do in visual studio we have a way to do on command-line and that's because if you're on a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.640" end="00:06:10.110">...linux machine there is no visual studio...code we just announced yesterday right but,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:10.110" end="00:06:15.770">it's an editor and this will cause a lot of ...a confusion consternation where people will say hey I like</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.770" end="00:06:20.690">visual studio code winning...this fancy new visual studio feature in visual studio code</p>
      <p begin="00:06:20.690" end="00:06:24.860">missing the point if you ask those kinda questions...not going to...any visual designers</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24.860" end="00:06:28.980">in visual studio code if you want to know how to do this thing in visual coding</p>
      <p begin="00:06:28.980" end="00:06:33.950">to the command-line because that's who that's for but if you are and id person you're going</p>
      <p begin="00:06:33.950" end="00:06:39.190">to the id and this features that we're going to show you were going to spend some time in text files</p>
      <p begin="00:06:39.190" end="00:06:43.810">doing things the command-line for all of those things there is also a gesture a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:43.810" end="00:06:48.810">ui gesture within the studio so he might prefer to go to the command-line and type,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:48.810" end="00:06:53.610">you know, restore whatever someone else might refer prefer to write click on something and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:53.610" end="00:06:57.360">solution explore into the same gesture but the essence is the same so we're going</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57.360" end="00:07:01.590">to show you the ui layer and then what's underneath and the nice thing of</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.590" end="00:07:07.460">...that there's no black boxes anymore right we're not going to take the visual...oop that...be a</p>
      <p begin="00:07:07.460" end="00:07:11.580">...actually that's pretty I would hate to call it text studio it's not quite</p>
      <p begin="00:07:11.580" end="00:07:16.830">as cool command-line studio command-line studio the other thing is we want we want arithmetic</p>
      <p begin="00:07:16.830" end="00:07:21.380">the fast is it possibly can be so there's a lot of work has been done in</p>
      <p begin="00:07:21.380" end="00:07:25.870">...five to make it super-fast and scale a lot more...today so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:25.870" end="00:07:30.820">...estimate five application...ninety percent less memory than a existing...</p>
      <p begin="00:07:30.820" end="00:07:37.000">application today and, that's because we stripped a bunch of stuff out and...bunch of stuff to the point that we</p>
      <p begin="00:07:37.000" end="00:07:40.770">are comparably or better than no js and in many</p>
      <p begin="00:07:40.770" end="00:07:46.010">...situations now so that's kind of core tenets on is it five okay and,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:46.010" end="00:07:50.490">then are ... is a share final slide that nice we are five minutes in we</p>
      <p begin="00:07:50.490" end="00:07:56.490">are last slide is a developer conference after all there's actually a person from a popular news</p>
      <p begin="00:07:56.490" end="00:08:03.790">site who was complaining about all the code that was being showed in the keynote?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:03.790" end="00:08:06.930">Thank you...here you on the tape yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.930" end="00:08:19.250">I mean this is a developer conference this next year we're going to put on the microsoft powerpoint conference just for those people that.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:19.250" end="00:08:19.870">Yes,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:19.870" end="00:08:25.580">so, these circle parts in yellow are the parts of asp net and,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:25.580" end="00:08:30.030">dot net...open-source and there are more than there are not all of the jitter</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30.030" end="00:08:34.490">all the compilers all the core...dot...core framework itself is</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.490" end="00:08:37.720">...net...parts four and five</p>
      <p begin="00:08:37.720" end="00:08:42.400">...signal are all open-source you notice the pieces that aren't are some of</p>
      <p begin="00:08:42.400" end="00:08:46.500">...pieces the pieces chip with windows the pieces for which there are no good reasons for them to get the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:46.500" end="00:08:51.160">open-source even the ones...circled the source code is available like</p>
      <p begin="00:08:51.160" end="00:08:56.480">...four-point-six for all of us spatially you can get these source its source open right reference</p>
      <p begin="00:08:56.480" end="00:09:00.510">source...the reason there is we did open-source code and put a lot...source code for</p>
      <p begin="00:09:00.510" end="00:09:04.570">dot net four-six up and get up the challenges we can't really think</p>
      <p begin="00:09:04.570" end="00:09:10.050">...contribution because if you change anything that framework something breaks somewhere and,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:10.050" end="00:09:12.270">you know, you guys all the rumah probably got,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:12.270" end="00:09:16.050">you know, a for five-one or for five-two...feature head against the wall and</p>
      <p begin="00:09:16.050" end="00:09:21.510">in work and that's why we don't take changes on that thing and that's actually a really great point for why</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.510" end="00:09:26.750">we've architected this the way it is that you want to be able to take application a and put on a machine and</p>
      <p begin="00:09:26.750" end="00:09:31.370">...and someone else another apartment makes app be you don't want to have</p>

      <p begin="00:10:43.460" end="00:10:48.140">write the check this out click on the version of the...</p>
      <p begin="00:10:48.140" end="00:10:52.120">I want to...or I want to epub want to read the kindle.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:52.120" end="00:10:54.770">Click on pbs and now you're bringing down the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:54.770" end="00:10:59.730">...and when the changes get made in get hub that automatically...flows through so we're given that a</p>
      <p begin="00:10:59.730" end="00:11:03.240">try, yeah, once we feel is totally out we actually plan to publish those</p>
      <p begin="00:11:03.240" end="00:11:12.390">...ourselves on some of the stores yet and we're going to...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:12.390" end="00:11:15.140">Check it out nice.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:15.140" end="00:11:16.560">All right much blank pages.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:19.160" end="00:11:20.710">Nice there.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:20.710" end="00:11:24.930">That pages intentionally left length.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:24.930" end="00:11:29.360">All books start with...idling pages I don't know why kill trees.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:32.180">...a big it's big tree lobby.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:32.180" end="00:11:36.130">As we were saying earlier ...at five is</p>
      <p begin="00:11:36.130" end="00:11:41.140">modular so this is what the minimal estimate application looks like today...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:41.140" end="00:11:46.140">is hello world this is hello world and this looks like very similar to something that you would see in something like</p>
      <p begin="00:11:46.140" end="00:11:50.030">...js now this isn't file new project default app this is empty</p>
      <p begin="00:11:50.030" end="00:11:54.950">...boundary project empty application ok so this is a difference between the one...get bootstrap</p>
      <p begin="00:11:54.950" end="00:11:59.930">...this is...now the difference between doing this and opening up web forms and going</p>
      <p begin="00:11:59.930" end="00:12:06.730">into default spx and typing response dot write line hello world is what sir.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:06.730" end="00:12:10.880">...because you never listen to me course not the difference between this</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:15.780">here and...default spx and saying response that right hello world yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:15.780" end="00:12:19.720">and, if you're doing default...in spx were in dc or any</p>
      <p begin="00:12:19.720" end="00:12:24.020">those kinds of things there's a whole pile of modules are going to run inside of</p>
      <p begin="00:12:24.020" end="00:12:27.870">...layers between un hello world layers for good reason</p>
      <p begin="00:12:27.870" end="00:12:30.360">...the important thing when you hear that something is</p>
      <p begin="00:12:30.360" end="00:12:33.600">improved in performance by to hundred-percent that doesn't mean that it</p>
      <p begin="00:12:33.600" end="00:12:36.980">sucked hundred-percent before and we just found something</p>
      <p begin="00:12:36.980" end="00:12:41.770">...literally trying to understand the difference between how do you build a mini-van which is extremely useful for caring</p>
      <p begin="00:12:41.770" end="00:12:46.910">kids and groceries around and how do you build a motorcycle but use the same core concepts</p>
      <p begin="00:12:46.910" end="00:12:51.840">we wanted to make...that five both of those things so you could...anything you want here</p>
      <p begin="00:12:51.840" end="00:12:55.910">and, this is when you see some of these synthetic benchmarks against net and they're comparing,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:55.910" end="00:12:59.660">you know, we're running modules who running routing we're running error pages</p>
      <p begin="00:12:59.660" end="00:13:02.780">...bring all that technology...hello world</p>
      <p begin="00:13:02.780" end="00:13:07.490">guess what we're going to slow right you can't benchmark node and web forms if node all they do is</p>
      <p begin="00:13:07.490" end="00:13:14.410">handler...world and just kind of...eye-hand...as a lower?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:14.410" end="00:13:17.560">This would be what you would compare but if but even that this</p>
      <p begin="00:13:17.560" end="00:13:21.570">...handler, handler still going to have all that other stuff happen so you have basically nothing</p>
      <p begin="00:13:21.570" end="00:13:26.550">right I have nothing so this would be this will give me a yells going to death right so normally you would get a nice air page</p>
      <p begin="00:13:26.550" end="00:13:35.280">...if you're in this in a...much lower-level...page when I run this okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:35.280" end="00:13:35.780">White.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:37.550" end="00:13:42.410">you get basically a stack up and...that come from that came from our web post</p>
      <p begin="00:13:42.410" end="00:13:48.280">okay from the host...this is the thing that holds the whole thing togetherboots the stack up said</p>
      <p begin="00:13:48.280" end="00:13:52.770">hey the app blew up in my face okay here's...here's what I put out now</p>
      <p begin="00:13:52.770" end="00:13:59.090">...interesting if you actually want a nice airbases show how modular we are let me-let me</p>
      <p begin="00:13:59.090" end="00:14:02.330">jumping down here and...page.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:02.330" end="00:14:06.010">...while he's doing that he could go to references</p>
      <p begin="00:14:06.010" end="00:14:08.790">and add reference or add new get.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:08.790" end="00:14:12.990">But, those references are there on the left-hand side so that's an example of there's the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:12.990" end="00:14:15.440">...gesture...the text gesture</p>
      <p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:20.350">usual makes you happy the result is the same notice that when he type that diagnostics</p>
      <p begin="00:14:20.350" end="00:14:25.560">...appeared on the right-hand side if you had done that with the ui gesture it-would appeared in the text</p>
      <p begin="00:14:25.560" end="00:14:28.340">file make sense.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:28.340" end="00:14:33.280">So, now I've got an emphasis use era page so basically enabled and air page</p>
      <p begin="00:14:33.280" end="00:14:36.190">...the application...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:36.190" end="00:14:38.350">...not ship with their page now we get a</p>
      <p begin="00:14:38.350" end="00:14:46.280">sang on and you've got a bunch of stuff in here.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:46.280" end="00:14:47.260">That doesn't do anything.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:48.460" end="00:14:51.700">This is an empty app always...app there's</p>
      <p begin="00:14:51.700" end="00:14:57.980">...doesn't have anything there's not much in thisthose a light up as we start filling up...stuff right but,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:57.980" end="00:15:02.550">this is a nice change that you can not change replaces your page which you never could have</p>
      <p begin="00:15:02.550" end="00:15:07.350">done before because there's no way to recompile system web and replace...a pipeline,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:07.350" end="00:15:12.100">pipeline nice another fun thing to show here as well is now</p>
      <p begin="00:15:12.100" end="00:15:17.290">that you describe this folder that we have new folder called the brute, yeah, this is a really interesting one when</p>
      <p begin="00:15:17.290" end="00:15:22.070">nbc came out people who are web for people get freaked out because you go ahead slash</p>
      <p begin="00:15:22.070" end="00:15:24.490">home slash index and they go looking for that on-disk?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:25.530" end="00:15:26.660">And, this was actually a weakness</p>
      <p begin="00:15:26.660" end="00:15:31.290">of web forms developers about ten fifteen years ago because what would happen as we go to other frameworks and we'd</p>
      <p begin="00:15:31.290" end="00:15:35.710">go looking for stuff because we thought there was a direct relationship between the url</p>
      <p begin="00:15:35.710" end="00:15:39.650">...disk...move forward into a</p>
      <p begin="00:15:39.650" end="00:15:44.410">new world where you've got javascript libraries that you bring in the need to be squares</p>
      <p begin="00:15:44.410" end="00:15:49.450">...needs to be mystified there is now a difference between the code that you look at</p>
      <p begin="00:15:49.450" end="00:15:53.120">and the resulting build of your application so www</p>
      <p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:57.940">...is now if folder a place that lives under your app that's where static</p>
      <p begin="00:15:57.940" end="00:16:03.190">stuff is served out of so if you want to serve foo dot html you don't drop it in the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:03.190" end="00:16:07.720">root of your project you drop it in...root the value that</p>
      <p begin="00:16:07.720" end="00:16:12.200">provides is that I can add a bunch of javascript libraries doesn't automatically make them accessible</p>
      <p begin="00:16:12.200" end="00:16:16.350">to my application they get accessible...my app when I copy them into</p>
      <p begin="00:16:16.350" end="00:16:21.280">wwe route which means I...have the unmanned fide versions out my can be looking at them and then I can go</p>
      <p begin="00:16:21.280" end="00:16:25.510">and post-process them and drop them in there so what if you denser so what</p>
      <p begin="00:16:25.510" end="00:16:28.300">...new now is I added</p>
      <p begin="00:16:28.300" end="00:16:31.790">go back to visual studio I added a hello that html file</p>
      <p begin="00:16:31.790" end="00:16:36.240">...application you have hello dot html so he put that inside that we're.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:38.120">Okay, so, then.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:38.120" end="00:16:46.470">Does it get serve when you ask for and then we're going to do is going to ask for that okay?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:46.470" end="00:16:50.460">Do not get served...said hello html?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:50.460" end="00:16:55.430">you basically my app spits out hello world no matter no matter what so</p>
      <p begin="00:16:55.430" end="00:16:58.530">...the handler, handler those learning last the last</p>
      <p begin="00:16:58.530" end="00:17:02.710">...anything you want there just like...and then it was work.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:02.710" end="00:17:06.280">Yes, archetype...webbing that's what types to happens,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:06.280" end="00:17:11.540">you know,...allstate catches everything but the point the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:11.540" end="00:17:16.260">point there is we don't even serve static files...don't included error page and</p>
      <p begin="00:17:16.260" end="00:17:27.670">...on included static file handler that is innovation.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:27.670" end="00:17:30.610">...the point here is...cafeteria plan</p>
      <p begin="00:17:30.610" end="00:17:34.940">you get exactly what you want no more than you ask for so this</p>
      <p begin="00:17:34.940" end="00:17:39.000">...absolute control I just added static files back home.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:39.000" end="00:17:42.140">And, I'll come over here and this now see app</p>
      <p begin="00:17:42.140" end="00:17:47.060">...positive for a second please...this out because this whole use thing is</p>
      <p begin="00:17:47.060" end="00:17:50.810">confusing you see those arrows are pointing down those are extension methods</p>
      <p begin="00:17:50.810" end="00:17:55.430">we added that static file thing in there is now use static files it's not</p>
      <p begin="00:17:55.430" end="00:17:59.780">that you have to memorize a whole bunch of use this and use that kind of stuff as you add new</p>
      <p begin="00:17:59.780" end="00:18:01.690">packages you go and let's say someone</p>
      <p begin="00:18:01.690" end="00:18:06.680">makes the open-source way better version of the...screen of death.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:06.680" end="00:18:10.200">He'll just swap out his version swap that went in and then he'll</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.200" end="00:18:15.470">use their extension method and that added into the pipeline that's how that appeared there.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:15.470" end="00:18:18.300">So, can we serve html...new strangled</p>
      <p begin="00:18:18.300" end="00:18:22.970">...things there you go hello from the build...even better when it's big farm?</p>
      <p begin="00:18:22.970" end="00:18:26.670">So, I just showing you we're now modular you can turn on or off all</p>
      <p begin="00:18:26.670" end="00:18:31.740">of our features as much as you want.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:31.740" end="00:18:35.210">So, now let's go and create a...app like an actual default</p>
      <p begin="00:18:35.210" end="00:18:37.920">...here and this is also an interesting point</p>
      <p begin="00:18:37.920" end="00:18:42.800">...he makes is this new app there's a difference between a web forms app...</p>
      <p begin="00:18:42.800" end="00:18:47.630">session cookie management and all those kinds of things...nbc app...multiple layers and</p>
      <p begin="00:18:47.630" end="00:18:52.650">are very low-level tiny maybe and io t scenario where you've got...serving</p>
      <p begin="00:18:52.650" end="00:18:58.050">jason you're doing that directly or something in between with web api we want you to</p>
      <p begin="00:18:58.050" end="00:19:01.760">be able to do those little scenarios and the big scenarios</p>
      <p begin="00:19:01.760" end="00:19:06.460">and because you can pick the pieces that you want you're going to get the perf you're never going to be asking yourself a</p>
      <p begin="00:19:06.460" end="00:19:10.540">question like what's in between me and the wire?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:10.540" end="00:19:11.280">Some saying.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:12.310" end="00:19:14.490">Abstraction layers can get you in trouble</p>
      <p begin="00:19:14.490" end="00:19:18.710">you add too many layers of abstraction and we hit a lot of stuff and web forms and that's</p>
      <p begin="00:19:18.710" end="00:19:23.020">okay because it's a powerful framework for putting together compose will apps but we</p>
      <p begin="00:19:23.020" end="00:19:27.380">hit them because dragging a button on to design surface and making it button click was an</p>
      <p begin="00:19:27.380" end="00:19:32.880">important scenario important scenario but now we're in a new world right what the key</p>
      <p begin="00:19:32.880" end="00:19:35.860">to into the new world because we now don't require visual</p>
      <p begin="00:19:35.860" end="00:19:40.090">...is we do all of our compilation inside of our inside race net</p>
      <p begin="00:19:40.090" end="00:19:43.010">...compile itself so in this scenario</p>
      <p begin="00:19:43.010" end="00:19:47.650">...modify this...get the page appear your application description page share</p>
      <p begin="00:19:47.650" end="00:19:53.430">...say hello...has to be clear this is not...your in...csharp code</p>
      <p begin="00:19:53.430" end="00:19:59.530">okay you haven't typed control I'm not I'm not saved anything at all don't trick them and on your machine</p>
      <p begin="00:19:59.530" end="00:20:03.410">...two seconds on my machine it'll take like six seconds and that's because if you</p>
      <p begin="00:20:03.410" end="00:20:10.270">...too much junk on...so...point here is we're now building.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:10.270" end="00:20:13.880">...and what's cool that is...roslyn to do this and what the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:13.880" end="00:20:17.170">perfect proves we have is when we compile now we no longer</p>
      <p begin="00:20:18.330" end="00:20:23.100">...when you make a change you save some csharp</p>
      <p begin="00:20:23.100" end="00:20:26.770">disk then you loaded back up into the compiler than the compiler saves</p>

      <p begin="00:23:27.290" end="00:23:30.350">it's in the project okay if you don't want</p>
      <p begin="00:23:30.350" end="00:23:34.630">their we've inverted it so now you would exclude that right out of the project</p>
      <p begin="00:23:34.630" end="00:23:38.740">...so we're showing all the packages that we require for this application</p>

      <p begin="00:23:43.350" end="00:23:45.820">And, then what's in the references is what we got</p>
      <p begin="00:23:45.820" end="00:23:49.890">right and we planned actually replace packages that can fig across the projects</p>
      <p begin="00:23:49.890" end="00:23:54.810">...project adjacent future as well that's coming something else we have years we have commands,</p>
