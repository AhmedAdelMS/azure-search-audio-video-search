      <p begin="00:00:35.110" end="00:00:39.670">we think web apps should be simple to make.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.670" end="00:00:42.950">They should feel familiar to web developers and they</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.950" end="00:00:46.550">should be powerful and that's what we're going to talk about today</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.550" end="00:00:50.020">ways to reuse the code that you already have.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.150" end="00:00:55.140">Websites web apps that you've already built a frameworks</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.140" end="00:00:57.130">...already using of</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.130" end="00:01:03.550">...you already have and use that to build great apps on windows.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.550" end="00:01:04.130">Just a little bit</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.130" end="00:01:08.760">...here submit evaluation and you have a chance to win a</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.760" end="00:01:09.260">prize.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.360" end="00:01:15.050">I...know what that prizes but I'm sure it's exciting because it's from microsoft and we get a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.050" end="00:01:19.310">inciting stuff right now ok so this is the agenda that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.310" end="00:01:23.780">we going through today we're going to just go over what a windows web app</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.780" end="00:01:29.510">is in whatyou know, what makes it out in app then we're going to spend a lot of time talking</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.510" end="00:01:34.330">about hosted web applications but we also want to talk about the changes that we have</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.330" end="00:01:37.950">...package web apps and the new web view that we have an windows</p>
      <p begin="00:01:37.950" end="00:01:42.590">...as well and then we're going to end with tulane and talk about how some of the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.590" end="00:01:48.140">changes to the platform are bringing innovation to the tooling as well?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.140" end="00:01:52.390">All right so let's go ahead and get started with the windows ten.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.390" end="00:01:54.760">So, windows ten apps we've been on a journey</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.760" end="00:01:59.150">two-one app platform for one windows so your apps run across</p>
      <p begin="00:01:59.150" end="00:02:03.940">the multiple devices on the windows platform windows web apps</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.940" end="00:02:07.820">are part of the universal windows platform they'll run across</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.820" end="00:02:13.310">the multiple windows devices like the desktop mobile xbox.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.310" end="00:02:15.010">The io t devices like hollow</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.010" end="00:02:19.940">...these are just universal windows apps if you make a posted web app</p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.940" end="00:02:22.230">...run across universal windows</p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.690" end="00:02:27.460">...web app is one of the universal apps that you can</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.460" end="00:02:30.480">write for windows and now.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.520" end="00:02:34.900">We've talked a lot this week about the new microsoft edge</p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.900" end="00:02:40.390">browser and how we have a brand new engine that runs</p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.700" end="00:02:46.660">the edge engine that does the rendering and quite powerful and then</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.660" end="00:02:51.340">we also have a new shocker engine that runs javascript significantly</p>
      <p begin="00:02:51.340" end="00:02:55.350">faster you have in the past so that's what runs the browser?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:55.350" end="00:02:58.420">Now when we move into the application space we</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.420" end="00:03:01.940">...javascript application environment</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.940" end="00:03:06.900">that uses that same engine and uses the same javascript engine</p>
      <p begin="00:03:06.900" end="00:03:12.280">two-run your applications so what you really have is you have a sandbox</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.280" end="00:03:16.950">application that runs exactly like we have...the browser so the same</p>
      <p begin="00:03:16.950" end="00:03:21.820">at rendering engine the same javascript engine now what that allows you</p>
      <p begin="00:03:21.820" end="00:03:26.800">to do is a developer is...this term on your own the best way</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.800" end="00:03:31.790">to run your web content you can run it as a packaged app</p>
      <p begin="00:03:31.790" end="00:03:36.620">input all of your content inside of the app acts or you can now run it</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.620" end="00:03:40.370">as a hosted application where instead of packaging content</p>
      <p begin="00:03:40.370" end="00:03:45.200">inside the app you're actually going to be pointing externally to your web</p>
      <p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:50.110">server and then of course you can also mix the environment's and have some of your</p>
      <p begin="00:03:50.110" end="00:03:55.480">code running locally and some of the running on a web server windows ten gives us a</p>
      <p begin="00:03:55.480" end="00:03:59.640">lot of flexibility for the developer for you to determine how</p>
      <p begin="00:03:59.640" end="00:04:03.440">...vast uone two-run in package your code?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.440" end="00:04:08.680">Now to kind of illustrate we are going to jump in and do a</p>
      <p begin="00:04:08.680" end="00:04:13.560">bunch of demos of the hosted web apps and show you some really great examples of how this</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.560" end="00:04:21.949">...but we wanted to make it a little bit fine so instead of...</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21.949" end="00:04:26.209">Having just hosted apps we wanted to have a hosted web app</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.209" end="00:04:26.709">jeopardy.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.919" end="00:04:29.799">Which we call?</p>

      <p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:06:00.870">web app allows you as a developer to continue</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.870" end="00:06:05.840">with the workflows that you already have when you're writing for the web so we do</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.840" end="00:06:10.180">realize web developers write code in other places other</p>
      <p begin="00:06:10.180" end="00:06:14.230">than visual studio so whether you're using visual studio your using sublime</p>
      <p begin="00:06:14.230" end="00:06:18.960">...or whatever editor that-you...remember your writing code that's</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.960" end="00:06:25.280">publish for the web so you can continue to use the editor that you want?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:30.380">Is quite ...for us is web developers to push our code to repost and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:30.380" end="00:06:35.170">usually get repost that we store and get have or some other fantastic place</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.170" end="00:06:41.620">that still works remember your workflow for web is going to stay the same?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.620" end="00:06:45.930">As well as your deployment model so remember it doesn't matter where</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.930" end="00:06:50.730">...deploying your code it doesn't matter what type of code you're using if</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.730" end="00:06:57.840">...web app is written in ruby or in java or in</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57.840" end="00:07:01.170">no js you can continue to use that technology</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.170" end="00:07:06.940">because remember where utilizing the web apps you have on your server and when you put</p>
      <p begin="00:07:06.940" end="00:07:11.070">that all together you end up with a rich windows application</p>

      <p begin="00:08:17.930" end="00:08:22.880">x manifest inside the standard windows ten javascript project this is</p>
      <p begin="00:08:22.880" end="00:08:27.980">part of the blind template and I've replaced it with my website url so as the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:27.980" end="00:08:33.810">star page I've given it nick dot com and there's one more thing that I had to do in order to</p>
      <p begin="00:08:33.810" end="00:08:36.110">turn...dot com into a hosted web</p>
      <p begin="00:08:36.110" end="00:08:42.430">app and what that was under application content...rules?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:42.430" end="00:08:47.430">what these rules are they really define the container and where your web</p>
      <p begin="00:08:47.430" end="00:08:52.580">app lives where the web begins so you you're able to define</p>
      <p begin="00:08:52.580" end="00:08:57.550">the website urls better inside your app and the ones that are external to your app and</p>
      <p begin="00:08:57.550" end="00:09:02.230">launch in a default browser so inside of here I've given nick dot com is one of the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:02.230" end="00:09:09.140">urls this is my app and now all I have to do is hit run?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.140" end="00:09:13.750">...run my application it's a hosted web app disappointing to the web and this is the</p>

      <p begin="00:10:30.510" end="00:10:35.360">server it's quite common for us in our web code to have links to other places on</p>
      <p begin="00:10:35.360" end="00:10:40.220">the web correct so we want-to make sure that a user</p>
      <p begin="00:10:40.220" end="00:10:45.220">...site doesn't end up on the internet when they're inside of our app and that's what we</p>
      <p begin="00:10:45.220" end="00:10:46.410">introduce the rules</p>
      <p begin="00:10:46.410" end="00:10:50.720">it allows us to say this is the scope of our application when</p>

      <p begin="00:16:17.320" end="00:16:21.860">There it is the code...loaded I can write wide coding here added code</p>
      <p begin="00:16:21.860" end="00:16:26.220">and add code of already done integration for the windows system</p>

      <p begin="00:16:39.370" end="00:16:43.440">So, I'll go to the browser...browser.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:44.860">And, I've got some code</p>
      <p begin="00:16:44.860" end="00:16:50.310">...already upon it's a publicly public available just doing feature detection</p>
      <p begin="00:16:50.310" end="00:16:54.680">and calling into the contact picker...copy and paste that code.</p>

      <p begin="00:16:57.550" end="00:17:06.720">So, all I have to do is that a new function.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:06.720" end="00:17:30.550">And, pace that feature detection code...into the picker rate in it.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:30.550" end="00:17:49.310">We mention we're not quite...with windows.</p>

      <p begin="00:17:57.920" end="00:18:02.410">...code there'd is so all I have to do is add another</p>
      <p begin="00:18:02.410" end="00:18:11.410">button this one's for the system prompt but I'll add one for the...people picker.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:11.410" end="00:18:15.100">Call the...function.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:15.100" end="00:18:31.070">On the on click.</p>

      <p begin="00:18:36.790" end="00:18:40.800">There we go if...hits system prompt there</p>
      <p begin="00:18:40.800" end="00:18:44.510">...a popped open the people picker live insider code</p>
      <p begin="00:18:44.510" end="00:18:54.530">...did onstage what you think the awesome we think.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:54.530" end="00:18:59.190">All right so we're having a little fine...the truth is that it is</p>
      <p begin="00:18:59.190" end="00:19:04.130">sample to build a hosted application and what that allows you to do is</p>
      <p begin="00:19:04.130" end="00:19:09.000">to spend your time developing your web app and then we</p>
      <p begin="00:19:09.000" end="00:19:12.790">make the code part real easy a little bit configuration to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:12.790" end="00:19:18.050">turn that on so we're going to jump over and we're going to talk a little bit about the package</p>
      <p begin="00:19:18.050" end="00:19:24.930">javascript applications and some of the changes that we have in that space as well?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:24.930" end="00:19:26.030">Okay, so,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:26.030" end="00:19:31.080">a package javascript application is when you have your javascript code</p>
      <p begin="00:19:31.080" end="00:19:35.820">...you loaded inside the app...so, for example, I'll have html javascript</p>
      <p begin="00:19:35.820" end="00:19:40.900">css files it'll actually live inside of my package and wow it's</p>
      <p begin="00:19:40.900" end="00:19:43.100">...the package wegive</p>
      <p begin="00:19:43.100" end="00:19:46.690">...access to all of the windows universal api</p>
      <p begin="00:19:46.690" end="00:19:51.950">is and it is delivered through the store so it's inside your affects that's uploaded</p>
      <p begin="00:19:51.950" end="00:19:56.780">into the store and the users...download your entire app you need additional data you</p>
      <p begin="00:19:56.780" end="00:20:00.290">make service calls to go out and load that...data</p>
      <p begin="00:20:00.290" end="00:20:03.970">your packaged apps can also be hybrid if you want to utilize a web</p>
      <p begin="00:20:03.970" end="00:20:07.510">view along with them we have an html five web view that can</p>
      <p begin="00:20:07.510" end="00:20:12.820">point-two additional package content or external content as well now we</p>
      <p begin="00:20:12.820" end="00:20:18.020">introduce this concept with windows eight and when we did we along with it</p>
      <p begin="00:20:18.020" end="00:20:21.880">...a security policy that was custom</p>
      <p begin="00:20:21.880" end="00:20:27.020">to windows so it was a windows web app security policy and</p>
      <p begin="00:20:27.020" end="00:20:32.440">is anyone who likes writing code for just one platform?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:32.440" end="00:20:35.410">As a web development community we are like that but I'll be honest at</p>
      <p begin="00:20:35.410" end="00:20:39.910">...time there was no standard security policy that worked</p>
      <p begin="00:20:39.910" end="00:20:44.350">across the browsers so we created one chrome created</p>
      <p begin="00:20:44.350" end="00:20:48.850">one firefox created one they were all very similar but points in</p>
      <p begin="00:20:48.850" end="00:20:52.640">a made frameworks especially have to write different code to run</p>
      <p begin="00:20:52.640" end="00:20:56.730">in different applications well we're really excited because</p>
      <p begin="00:20:56.730" end="00:21:01.630">now we have a wthree-c standard it's called the...the content</p>
      <p begin="00:21:01.630" end="00:21:06.230">security policy that allows us to determine on a standard</p>
      <p begin="00:21:06.230" end="00:21:11.160">wait what we're going to allow happen inside of our web apps so</p>
      <p begin="00:21:11.160" end="00:21:15.980">we're real excited to support csp inside of web apps in windows</p>
      <p begin="00:21:15.980" end="00:21:21.250">tag so that means you as...developer can determine</p>
      <p begin="00:21:21.250" end="00:21:26.570">what the security policy is going to be on your pagewe have by default</p>
      <p begin="00:21:26.570" end="00:21:31.580">the on the screen there you'll see the default security policy that we have.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:31.580" end="00:21:34.600">And, then you can alter this as a developer so you can</p>
      <p begin="00:21:34.600" end="00:21:39.540">make it tighter if you knows that you're not going to need a</p>
      <p begin="00:21:39.540" end="00:21:43.800">...value for inline css we recommend you update your security</p>
      <p begin="00:21:43.800" end="00:21:48.660">policy to follow that encoding standard as well so that</p>
      <p begin="00:21:48.660" end="00:21:52.830">it locks down your app even more if you're using a</p>
      <p begin="00:21:52.830" end="00:21:58.370">framework that might need some of these features that are blocked by default well then you can</p>
      <p begin="00:21:58.370" end="00:22:02.450">lessen your security policy as well as the goal is to lead enhance</p>
      <p begin="00:22:02.450" end="00:22:06.200">the developers and there's quite a few different things that you can</p>
      <p begin="00:22:06.200" end="00:22:11.870">alter we have some examples on the screen you can basically determine</p>
      <p begin="00:22:11.870" end="00:22:16.680">how you loader code where you loaded from in the type of code that you're</p>

      <p begin="00:28:12.860" end="00:28:16.770">So, just to show the javascript running inside the web view of just created a</p>

      <p begin="00:28:19.230" end="00:28:24.000">And, what that function calls is it directly often window object?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:24.000" end="00:28:27.190">Calls the communicator object that I named it</p>
      <p begin="00:28:27.190" end="00:28:35.800">...toast message from the csharp code so if I run this on my machine.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:35.800" end="00:28:40.630">There's the application I have kind of like the application on top on the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.630" end="00:28:45.630">bottom I have some web content loaded inside mobile view this is a common scenario and for</p>
      <p begin="00:28:45.630" end="00:28:49.020">...web allowed object I'm able to hit notify and have a</p>
      <p begin="00:28:49.020" end="00:28:56.050">...notification pop-up from the application?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:56.050" end="00:29:02.270">Right and now switch back to the presentation the cover more of the new api is that we added.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:02.270" end="00:29:07.140">Another new api that we added came directly from feedback that we got</p>
      <p begin="00:29:07.140" end="00:29:11.770">...developers was the clear data api and we've heard that it's been</p>
      <p begin="00:29:11.770" end="00:29:16.440">hard before to clear the cache of the application any remote content that was...</p>
      <p begin="00:29:16.440" end="00:29:22.510">remain there so we added a clear data api to give developers of the ability to do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:22.510" end="00:29:28.030">The new window event gives you notification as a developer for</p>
      <p begin="00:29:28.030" end="00:29:33.190">...window dot open or things like that are called from within the web you so you can choose to popped</p>
      <p begin="00:29:33.190" end="00:29:36.940">...new window or in the default browser.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:36.940" end="00:29:41.640">We've added the permission requested api or events and what this event gives you</p>
      <p begin="00:29:41.640" end="00:29:46.450">control over is permission requests like get user media in geo location in the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:46.450" end="00:29:49.960">developers either able to defer to the user or auto</p>
      <p begin="00:29:49.960" end="00:29:53.390">allowance denied that request?</p>
      <p begin="00:29:53.390" end="00:29:56.640">Another thing that we added was the settings property.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:56.640" end="00:30:01.390">And, the settings property controls is javascript enabled and is index</p>
      <p begin="00:30:01.390" end="00:30:07.940">...enabled for the web...this is set before navigation?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:07.940" end="00:30:12.720">And, the next thing...cover is just like hosted web apps the web</p>
      <p begin="00:30:12.720" end="00:30:16.430">you has the ability to call into the windows runtime the windows</p>
      <p begin="00:30:16.430" end="00:30:21.140">name space through the manifest through the manifests allow list...adverb</p>
      <p begin="00:30:21.140" end="00:30:25.770">...object were also giving you more granular control where you're able to inject</p>
      <p begin="00:30:25.770" end="00:30:30.300">at runtime any component you'd be able to call.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:30.300" end="00:30:33.520">And, what that handed over to...</p>
      <p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:37.840">Yeah, we're really excited that the platforms really come together</p>
      <p begin="00:30:37.840" end="00:30:42.720">in windows ten you can write all of your code on the web server or you</p>
      <p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:46.350">...course...nato's but we really appreciate how the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:46.350" end="00:30:50.510">were able to blend the two together as well and the web...as well as the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:50.510" end="00:30:56.070">hosted application allow you to do that where you can call that code directly and</p>
      <p begin="00:30:56.070" end="00:30:59.700">your name code directly from your web code now a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:30:59.700" end="00:31:03.700">these changes have improve some of the stuff that we can do with</p>
      <p begin="00:31:03.700" end="00:31:08.080">tooling in windows ten as well so cordova is a</p>
      <p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:09.850">...popular framework for us web</p>
      <p begin="00:31:09.850" end="00:31:14.750">developers to use to build applications that work across platforms.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:14.750" end="00:31:20.870">And, with the improvements that we have an windows ten or...introduce some</p>
      <p begin="00:31:20.870" end="00:31:25.330">new scenarios for our developers now traditionally we've had the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:25.330" end="00:31:29.720">packaged cordova applications where cordova has</p>
      <p begin="00:31:29.720" end="00:31:33.550">...folder that lives in the package you put your web code in there and</p>
      <p begin="00:31:33.550" end="00:31:38.880">then it's distributed along with the package to each of the stores?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:38.880" end="00:31:41.900">We talked about our new hosted model in windows ten</p>
      <p begin="00:31:41.900" end="00:31:46.000">...to is able to utilize this hosted model</p>
      <p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:50.460">to run a cordova app from the server as well which means you can</p>
      <p begin="00:31:50.460" end="00:31:55.380">utilize cordova you could put the...js files on your server and run</p>
      <p begin="00:31:55.380" end="00:32:01.800">your cordova app completely hosted the third thing is ...to</p>
      <p begin="00:32:01.800" end="00:32:06.770">support the embedded scenarios for cordova what that allows you to do is if you</p>
      <p begin="00:32:06.770" end="00:32:11.760">have an application already and you want to introduce some new functionality</p>
      <p begin="00:32:11.760" end="00:32:16.640">with cordova or if you have an application that's native inches part of it utilizes</p>
      <p begin="00:32:16.640" end="00:32:18.190">...you can now</p>
      <p begin="00:32:18.190" end="00:32:22.890">imbed cordova it into your application which means</p>
      <p begin="00:32:22.890" end="00:32:27.760">your application functions as it as...cordova is a portion of that application</p>
      <p begin="00:32:27.760" end="00:32:32.710">that has access to the same api is the same cordova api that it does</p>
      <p begin="00:32:32.710" end="00:32:37.310">in any other scenario so we're really excited to be able to support all these options</p>
      <p begin="00:32:37.310" end="00:32:41.730">and cordova with windows ten web apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:41.730" end="00:32:46.880">Now I another thing that we had talked about this morning the keynote is a javascript</p>
      <p begin="00:32:46.880" end="00:32:51.340">frameworks that a bunch of our developers are working on and that's called</p>
      <p begin="00:32:51.340" end="00:32:55.920">meaningful js we talked about how great hosted applications</p>
      <p begin="00:32:55.920" end="00:33:01.750">are on windows how easy it is an how powerful they can be?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:01.750" end="00:33:02.270">A number</p>
      <p begin="00:33:02.270" end="00:33:07.210">platform support hosted applications already and the ones that don't can be</p>
      <p begin="00:33:07.210" end="00:33:13.040">enabled with some work that we've done with cordova so this allows you to</p>
      <p begin="00:33:13.040" end="00:33:17.510">manifold js allows you to take the same wthree-c standard that</p>
      <p begin="00:33:17.510" end="00:33:21.870">you used to build the windows apps and then use that to</p>
      <p begin="00:33:21.870" end="00:33:26.820">build applications for all those other platforms as well like I said when the nate when</p>
      <p begin="00:33:26.820" end="00:33:31.850">the platform supports...hosted app natively will build you...app when it doesn't</p>
      <p begin="00:33:31.850" end="00:33:36.520">we'll use cordova to...to build...application I think we</p>
      <p begin="00:33:36.520" end="00:33:40.710">best defying show a little demo on how this works flood easier this</p>
      <p begin="00:33:40.710" end="00:33:45.400">see to understand...</p>
      <p begin="00:33:45.400" end="00:33:51.620">All right the first thing I'm going to do is ...run.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:51.620" end="00:33:56.270">And, no, gs server so I already have this been going and this is just going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:33:56.270" end="00:34:00.640">a local server and it's the same one that we had shown in the keynote</p>

      <p begin="00:34:03.300" end="00:34:05.580">So, I have it running here.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:05.580" end="00:34:10.550">Shoots up and this is an application that I'm sure you've all seen those</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.550" end="00:34:16.130">...help you connect to other people wellthis is for us this helps us connect</p>
      <p begin="00:34:16.130" end="00:34:20.010">to other frameworks so you can determine whether you</p>

      <p begin="00:36:09.370" end="00:36:14.040">for firefox you have a manifests file that lives on your servers so we build</p>
      <p begin="00:36:14.040" end="00:36:18.610">that manifest file we take the hard part out of having to figure out how-to-do-it</p>

      <p begin="00:37:54.320" end="00:37:58.870">use a developer to focus on your website so we're real excited about that</p>

      <p begin="00:38:07.450" end="00:38:13.080">and manifests are meaningful js dot com or argued have repo and,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:13.080" end="00:38:17.830">there's a number of ways that you folks can help contribute to this to make it better and make it easier</p>
      <p begin="00:38:17.830" end="00:38:24.650">for web developers so.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:24.650" end="00:38:28.880">I think that's what we have here we have a bit of a summary of what we</p>
      <p begin="00:38:28.880" end="00:38:32.950">talked about today so we started talking...out about</p>
      <p begin="00:38:32.950" end="00:38:38.270">the universal windows apps in the fact that when you build a web app</p>
      <p begin="00:38:38.270" end="00:38:43.170">you are universal windows app so you can expect that to run anywhere</p>
      <p begin="00:38:43.170" end="00:38:48.850">that the universal windows apps friends we're excited to introduce hosted web apps and</p>
      <p begin="00:38:48.850" end="00:38:53.440">give you the ability to use the code that's living out on the web as the basis for a</p>
      <p begin="00:38:53.440" end="00:38:58.240">windows app while giving you access to the windows api is that can make</p>
      <p begin="00:38:58.240" end="00:39:00.780">it differentiated on the windows platforms.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:02.230" end="00:39:08.920">the improvements to the package apps with the new security bottle the new web view that we have</p>
      <p begin="00:39:08.920" end="00:39:13.050">that...supports all of the new edge rendering engines and then of</p>
      <p begin="00:39:13.050" end="00:39:16.720">course manifold js that we just demoed and that gives you the ability to</p>
      <p begin="00:39:16.720" end="00:39:19.780">take this pattern and use it across platforms.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:21.020" end="00:39:23.220">We have a few minutes left</p>
      <p begin="00:39:23.220" end="00:39:27.910">...here to take questions so if you have one we're going to ask</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.910" end="00:39:31.980">and if you can set up to the microphone if you don't want to just shouted</p>
      <p begin="00:39:31.980" end="00:39:36.380">out and will repeated...we want to make sure we...first question go ahead, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:36.380" end="00:39:42.510">I want to know what you're going to do to prevent people from rapping other people's web</p>
      <p begin="00:39:42.510" end="00:39:47.570">posted content and sites like...facebook but turning all the images</p>
      <p begin="00:39:47.570" end="00:39:51.050">read...a great question so you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:51.050" end="00:39:55.860">when we enable this that's one of the issues that we have to address as well so</p>
      <p begin="00:39:55.860" end="00:40:00.360">we actually now in our store policy have a constant</p>
      <p begin="00:40:00.360" end="00:40:05.110">review process which means that the apps are not only reviewed</p>
      <p begin="00:40:05.110" end="00:40:09.720">and when they're first submitted to the market but they're also reviewed</p>
      <p begin="00:40:09.720" end="00:40:15.130">throughout the lifetime of the app so that not only helps us catch you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:15.130" end="00:40:21.390">web apps that don't belong because right if you're...to the market and you don't have the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:21.390" end="00:40:26.330">writes for that but also like if an application and changes are starts breaking</p>
      <p begin="00:40:26.330" end="00:40:30.970">overtime or something we're going to be able to pick that up so as far as whether it's</p>
      <p begin="00:40:30.970" end="00:40:35.830">allowed or not is something that's going to be controlled from the content</p>
      <p begin="00:40:35.830" end="00:40:36.850">owners so,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:36.850" end="00:40:41.020">for example, if someone build a facebook application they weren't facebook,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:41.020" end="00:40:47.670">facebook would have the right to a request that removal?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:47.670" end="00:40:48.970">And, frat.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:48.970" end="00:40:50.660">Yet I just wanted to clarify</p>
      <p begin="00:40:51.730" end="00:40:57.720">...possible to have the...put that is the can</p>
      <p begin="00:40:57.720" end="00:41:03.080">...contains the third-party code...loading scripts from some site</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03.080" end="00:41:06.870">...facebook button stuff like that because currently it looks like it's</p>
      <p begin="00:41:06.870" end="00:41:11.450">only the your...</p>
      <p begin="00:41:11.450" end="00:41:15.420">No, that's actually not true so yes you can have a hosted web app</p>
      <p begin="00:41:15.420" end="00:41:19.630">that contains third-party code it could be third-party bargains from other sites on the web</p>
      <p begin="00:41:19.630" end="00:41:23.700">...just app include them in the application content your I roles so you define that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:23.700" end="00:41:28.480">...part of your application and, you can also have local third-party code</p>
      <p begin="00:41:28.480" end="00:41:34.480">that you can call from within your site that lives in your package.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:38.010">...event server question about the manifold peace and hosted</p>
      <p begin="00:41:38.010" end="00:41:42.360">versus package get and how that plays...ios yes so,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:42.360" end="00:41:46.630">for example, for manifold it sounds like</p>
      <p begin="00:41:46.630" end="00:41:50.390">...are hosted apps so it's still remote server and you can do</p>
      <p begin="00:41:50.390" end="00:41:54.020">all your stuff but it's really the...with remote</p>
      <p begin="00:41:54.020" end="00:41:58.720">...right but on apple...and now you if they believe that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:58.720" end="00:42:03.570">it is a show application where the files hosted remotely as opposed to locally</p>
      <p begin="00:42:03.570" end="00:42:07.680">tags so...apple as different policies than we do for the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:07.680" end="00:42:11.790">stores so we can control that we whatever, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:11.790" end="00:42:16.820">they what I dissatisfied now we have a number of partners who use this and we have</p>
      <p begin="00:42:16.820" end="00:42:20.460">worked with apple and without any problems now apples</p>
      <p begin="00:42:20.460" end="00:42:25.190">policy from what I understand is that they don't want to be only?</p>
      <p begin="00:42:25.190" end="00:42:29.480">Web hosted code they don't have a problem with it being hosted remotely</p>
      <p begin="00:42:29.480" end="00:42:34.310">...they don't want to be the same experience that you have when you're on the website</p>
      <p begin="00:42:34.310" end="00:42:38.510">from my experience it's been getting certification but and, I agree with</p>
      <p begin="00:42:38.510" end="00:42:43.680">you we want to push we actually want to push from the standard perspective</p>
      <p begin="00:42:43.680" end="00:42:49.270">on that because we think that...we know that...denying some great experiences that way and,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:49.270" end="00:42:53.920">that's part of with the wthree standard they may take a different approach to</p>
      <p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:55.270">and, I'll, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:55.270" end="00:43:00.060">to have the hosted apps supported needs soluble web...supporter...their platform</p>
      <p begin="00:43:00.060" end="00:43:05.560">wherein push really hard to make sure that there is a way to do it and based off of</p>
      <p begin="00:43:05.560" end="00:43:11.020">the standard okay that makes sense and then but for now manifold is the hosted yet</p>
      <p begin="00:43:11.020" end="00:43:16.020">so manifold is the way that we can make it work we actually utilize cordova</p>
      <p begin="00:43:16.020" end="00:43:19.550">online ios to...refill what they</p>
      <p begin="00:43:19.550" end="00:43:24.270">...support and,...if, you know,...know if you problems getting and we have partners</p>
      <p begin="00:43:24.270" end="00:43:28.430">who have already done this in our in the doing well in</p>
      <p begin="00:43:28.430" end="00:43:35.820">the ios store so we'd be happy to like make some connections and find out what they did.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:35.820" end="00:43:41.260">So, with the packaged and hosted web apps obviously the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:41.260" end="00:43:45.520">great things has access to the windows api is what about something like office so,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:45.520" end="00:43:53.900">for example, I want to be able to...email from outlook in the app what about the usable?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:53.900" end="00:43:57.820">Yes,...talk about that one.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:57.820" end="00:44:02.810">Yes, it would be you'd have to write some code either locally or some javascript code on</p>
      <p begin="00:44:02.810" end="00:44:07.800">the server to handle the content that you're dropping into the application but yes that's possible so</p>
      <p begin="00:44:07.800" end="00:44:12.560">if you're dropping some content you'd have to write code obviously to handle by content and uploaded or</p>
      <p begin="00:44:12.560" end="00:44:16.090">...or do whatever you like in your application but yes it is possible and</p>
      <p begin="00:44:16.090" end="00:44:19.420">...a...code on server like javascript does</p>
      <p begin="00:44:19.420" end="00:44:25.020">...to be isomorphic like using node or...we just?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:25.020" end="00:44:30.500">A could just be client-side javascript right it's hosted on your server but,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:30.500" end="00:44:36.850">it could be client-side encoded doesn't have to be server-side code thank you so if I wanted to</p>
      <p begin="00:44:36.850" end="00:44:41.760">deploy a...internal application just for my company and not make it publicly available</p>
      <p begin="00:44:41.760" end="00:44:46.250">in windows store is...a way to do that with those web apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:46.250" end="00:44:47.600">...other rules and,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:47.600" end="00:44:52.690">yeah, I know the rules so yes that is possible and actually if you want to do that</p>
      <p begin="00:44:52.690" end="00:44:58.880">...you can deploy him to you can side...those apps just within your company and</p>
      <p begin="00:44:58.880" end="00:45:01.340">...throughout your team.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:01.340" end="00:45:04.750">But, you also get some exceptions so,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:04.750" end="00:45:09.700">you're able to do things like...enterprise authentication and programmatic</p>
      <p begin="00:45:09.700" end="00:45:14.150">access to the documents library if you were just...load and app you can get those</p>
      <p begin="00:45:14.150" end="00:45:18.150">out access privileges if you were submitting to...store you could not if</p>
      <p begin="00:45:18.150" end="00:45:22.790">you're in-store not if you're in the store but this is true for all windows</p>
      <p begin="00:45:22.790" end="00:45:27.030">universe applications ok so if you if you decide loading...using</p>
      <p begin="00:45:27.030" end="00:45:32.270">...business store you actually have less restrictions</p>
      <p begin="00:45:32.270" end="00:45:35.370">...if it is through the general store.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:35.370" end="00:45:35.900">Okay,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:35.900" end="00:45:41.630">so, just my final question is...look like to deploy would you have to send out</p>
      <p begin="00:45:41.630" end="00:45:44.670">a packaged file the users</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.670" end="00:45:48.440">...solemn their computer what would it look like.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:48.440" end="00:45:50.790">So, you neither mr experts</p>
      <p begin="00:45:50.790" end="00:45:56.300">in space so if we're not quite right I'll apologize</p>
      <p begin="00:45:56.300" end="00:46:01.250">and there's a number of ways that you can do it side loading where you have a</p>
      <p begin="00:46:01.250" end="00:46:05.200">packages that's distributed is one but I believe there's also</p>
      <p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:10.970">way to create a local market I know I microsoft we do that</p>
      <p begin="00:46:10.970" end="00:46:15.220">in we actually have a number of our internal apps that use the hosted app</p>
      <p begin="00:46:15.220" end="00:46:19.540">patter and...because they do deploys like every day right and</p>
      <p begin="00:46:19.540" end="00:46:25.930">...which wouldn't be feasible to do that as a store as a native apps and</p>
      <p begin="00:46:25.930" end="00:46:32.860">in we then have our corporate store that we can download apps from so we...happy to</p>
      <p begin="00:46:32.860" end="00:46:41.240">plug-in with people who know more and ok...helpful thank you okay?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:41.240" end="00:46:46.750">...up it loud so if I make a packaged application you showed how...I can</p>
      <p begin="00:46:46.750" end="00:46:53.640">call native windows api using this ...was the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:53.640" end="00:46:54.750">...object api</p>
      <p begin="00:46:54.750" end="00:47:00.410">...can ical native ios ...stuff as well</p>
      <p begin="00:47:00.410" end="00:47:05.230">although I need something like phone gap in addition to manifold js to</p>
      <p begin="00:47:05.230" end="00:47:11.070">do that manifold uses cordova so yes you can</p>
      <p begin="00:47:11.070" end="00:47:14.980">you can call the api...cordova has a set of api is</p>
      <p begin="00:47:14.980" end="00:47:20.080">and then it has plugins that you can add so ...over that used to be called</p>
      <p begin="00:47:20.080" end="00:47:25.260">...for folks are now okay...is phone yes,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:25.260" end="00:47:30.070">...the...my question yes that's that you audio would have to do is add</p>
      <p begin="00:47:30.070" end="00:47:32.880">been javascript portion of it to your website so it</p>
      <p begin="00:47:32.880" end="00:47:39.710">...with your code and then you've got your api set their account thanks.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:39.710" end="00:47:43.590">Just one question and you might have answered is already but</p>
      <p begin="00:47:43.590" end="00:47:44.720">is local storage</p>
      <p begin="00:47:44.720" end="00:47:49.930">working as well yes local storage works for both the web view and hosted web</p>
      <p begin="00:47:51.440" end="00:47:55.470">...actually run this more offline or do you always need</p>
      <p begin="00:47:55.470" end="00:47:58.350">an initial access to the internet so what the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:58.350" end="00:48:03.280">...if it's a truly a hosted web app you could build local pages in the package where you can run</p>
      <p begin="00:48:03.280" end="00:48:08.590">and offline only but if it's a truly a...web app coining two-year</p>
      <p begin="00:48:08.590" end="00:48:13.400">...website you could use standard wthree-c technology offline technologies like index</p>
      <p begin="00:48:13.400" end="00:48:17.690">db local storage app cash to build and offline experience and the first-time you</p>
      <p begin="00:48:17.690" end="00:48:22.390">...it's obviously going to be remote and pulled down but if you have and offline experience</p>
      <p begin="00:48:22.390" end="00:48:34.110">built in the next time you open the application...doesn't have to be online cool thanks?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:34.110" end="00:48:38.730">...good question so the question is can you are extensions so this is</p>
      <p begin="00:48:38.730" end="00:48:42.300">...javascript application object is the rendering engine</p>
      <p begin="00:48:42.300" end="00:48:47.340">a javascript engines so it doesn't include like extensions browser helper</p>
      <p begin="00:48:47.340" end="00:48:52.030">objects plug-in like flash and that none of that is supported inside the hosted</p>
      <p begin="00:48:52.030" end="00:48:55.820">app just the html five.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:55.820" end="00:48:59.510">And, I was just...more thing though you can actually,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:59.510" end="00:49:03.870">you know, parent with native code which can give you that same</p>
      <p begin="00:49:03.870" end="00:49:10.950">...functionality that you have with a extension.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:10.950" end="00:49:15.980">...restrictions to popup windows.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:15.980" end="00:49:19.490">Inside hosted web application or inside a web the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:19.490" end="00:49:22.050">...hosted at.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:22.050" end="00:49:28.050">Insider hosted app yes, they'll open up in the default browser inside the web</p>
      <p begin="00:49:28.050" end="00:49:33.300">...able to handle them through an event that fires and choose to open a new web view</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.300" end="00:49:42.210">new window or whatever you'd like solvable that you would be a chrome that.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:42.210" end="00:49:46.070">Right what web view is just a different container just has mormon api set</p>
      <p begin="00:49:47.240" end="00:49:51.890">like enable you to handle things like windowed open popping of new windows inside the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:51.890" end="00:49:56.370">...container...fire hosted app containeris</p>
      <p begin="00:49:56.370" end="00:50:03.370">a lighter-weight container that doesn't have this api set that just...to...your web content?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:03.370" end="00:50:05.910">Why is it possible to build a needed</p>
      <p begin="00:50:05.910" end="00:50:10.140">components cplus-plus that uses a direct...and things like that and then</p>
      <p begin="00:50:10.140" end="00:50:17.240">...api to javascript so that the javascript and orchestrate such a native components?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:17.240" end="00:50:22.570">...dickens...yes you can so like, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:22.570" end="00:50:27.410">if you wanted to maybe use html for your markup or</p>
      <p begin="00:50:27.410" end="00:50:32.130">something, you know, actually I don't read your much but html mark-up I care</p>
      <p begin="00:50:32.130" end="00:50:37.660">but javascript basically having logicand, render</p>
      <p begin="00:50:37.660" end="00:50:43.290">things natively okay so you can have a cplus-plus component that your javascript can</p>
      <p begin="00:50:43.290" end="00:50:50.180">call...yes you can now wide one of the decisions you have to make is if</p>
      <p begin="00:50:50.180" end="00:50:55.100">your depending on how you're going to display your application and if</p>
      <p begin="00:50:55.100" end="00:50:58.700">you're hosted app then your cplus-plus will not be able to...to the</p>
      <p begin="00:50:58.700" end="00:51:04.050">screen if you're a you know,...a traditional web apt and you can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:51:04.050" end="00:51:08.180">have a web...in your cplus-plus app where yes</p>
      <p begin="00:51:08.180" end="00:51:12.980">your cplus-plus in your javascript...can call each other no problem so this is a</p>
      <p begin="00:51:12.980" end="00:51:22.950">couple different patterns depending on your scenario but what you're asking is possible.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:22.950" end="00:51:28.290">Do you guys do any performance optimizations for startup for the hosted apps like I know package</p>
      <p begin="00:51:28.290" end="00:51:32.520">dep skit by code...and stuff like that is there any facility to say</p>
      <p begin="00:51:32.520" end="00:51:36.750">...user installs associate app...download some of these files like, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:36.750" end="00:51:39.290">my j query whatever things are...change?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:39.290" end="00:51:42.950">And, you do any biker cashing or stuff like.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:42.950" end="00:51:45.640">So, yeah, all that applies not</p>
      <p begin="00:51:45.640" end="00:51:49.680">...installing before first launch but after first launch of</p>
      <p begin="00:51:49.680" end="00:51:59.370">those obstinate optimizations from the web platform for the windows web platforms to apply.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:59.370" end="00:52:01.570">I think that's it now we're going to be in the expert</p>
      <p begin="00:52:01.570" end="00:52:12.500">...one more question...so you can...the last one.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:12.500" end="00:52:15.280">Ok, the question was what kind of experience...you have with the legacy</p>
      <p begin="00:52:15.280" end="00:52:20.460">site that is not responsive so it would appear as your site does its own</p>
      <p begin="00:52:20.460" end="00:52:25.120">...similar things you gotta watch out for is if you have a dependency on flash.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:25.120" end="00:52:29.590">It's not going to work in...or in the web view and we don't do</p>
      <p begin="00:52:29.590" end="00:52:35.820">anything to make it responsive it's just going to render the way that it does.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:35.820" end="00:52:39.060">Ok, will be...expert zone if you guys have any other questions for the next</p>
