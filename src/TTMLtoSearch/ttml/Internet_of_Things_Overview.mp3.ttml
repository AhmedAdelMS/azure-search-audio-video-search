      <p begin="00:00:02.300" end="00:00:06.590">Good afternoon thanks thank it thanks everyone for joining us after a long day of</p>
      <p begin="00:00:06.590" end="00:00:12.220">sessions it's been a super exciting day we're really happy to be here this afternoon talking about</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.220" end="00:00:16.230">io t my name is sam george I run the</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.230" end="00:00:18.870">...efforts within the cloud enterprise</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.870" end="00:00:24.180">division I also want to thank everyone that's joining online this is my paul</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.180" end="00:00:29.380">...you should be the one presenting cloud and I...but it's the opposite so,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.380" end="00:00:32.860">go ahead and introduce...everybody I'm steve to share up</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.860" end="00:00:36.640">...forty four-years-old and finally almost not self-conscious about my</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.640" end="00:00:38.780">...anymore...really appreciate that censure</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.780" end="00:00:42.980">...welcome I know it's five pm your choices between</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.980" end="00:00:48.110">cocktails and us and thank you all for being here those of you that are attending via the web</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.110" end="00:00:52.900">we trust you've already cradle the beverage of your choice so with that.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.900" end="00:00:56.050">Patrol all right let's do it...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.070" end="00:01:11.880">We are going to.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.880" end="00:01:12.380">Ok.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.740" end="00:01:18.560">So, today we're going to be talking about the overall...opportunity</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.560" end="00:01:24.430">...you haven't been living under hockey probably heard about internet of things and what a big opportunity it</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.430" end="00:01:29.700">is we're going to sort of reiterate that also going to talk about the plans that we've got across</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.700" end="00:01:34.690">...your and windows for io t microsoft is extremely committed to io</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.690" end="00:01:39.270">t we think it's an incredibly important opportunity and,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.270" end="00:01:44.340">it's something that you're going to see a lot more from us going forward?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.340" end="00:01:48.550">...we've talked about coyote for a while but I have...not really a</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.550" end="00:01:53.150">new thing necessarily we've been doing imbedded for many years and often people come to</p>
      <p begin="00:01:53.150" end="00:01:54.550">me and say</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.550" end="00:01:59.280">...t thing like I've been sending data from my devices forever and I've had all these little devices</p>
      <p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:04.300">...work with...things long long-time so why...having a new conversation</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.300" end="00:02:07.870">...ty...worthy...you know, this room filling up with so many of</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.870" end="00:02:12.350">you I think the few different things one is the cost of hardware</p>
      <p begin="00:02:12.350" end="00:02:17.640">in a lot of domains is kind of asymptotically going to zero like literally</p>
      <p begin="00:02:17.640" end="00:02:22.640">...are some cases where you can get, you know, the marginal cost of producing a new piece of hardware over</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:26.330">large manufacturing run is almost negligible so,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.330" end="00:02:30.550">that's just made it very easy we can crank out hardware today...many domains almost</p>
      <p begin="00:02:30.550" end="00:02:34.130">as almost as cheaply as we crank out software in the past.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.130" end="00:02:36.140">The other thing that's changed is the pervasive</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.140" end="00:02:40.640">nys of connectivity used to be back in the day that connectivity was</p>
      <p begin="00:02:40.640" end="00:02:45.210">...bandwidth very slow...very expensive it was very hard to get a</p>
      <p begin="00:02:45.210" end="00:02:48.980">...high-bandwidth connection today between you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.980" end="00:02:53.810">three-g for...mobile data as well as prob wi-fi coverage data</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.810" end="00:02:58.780">is almost there and you can kind of depend on that for building new solutions tools</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.780" end="00:03:03.770">are much simpler than they have been in the past whether we're talking about the software side through visual</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.770" end="00:03:08.860">studio or through a lot of what's going on the open-source...through the hardware side through things like our</p>
      <p begin="00:03:08.860" end="00:03:13.740">do we know and raspberry...they're just making it very easy for people to develop hardware</p>
      <p begin="00:03:13.740" end="00:03:18.590">software solutions and the advent of new cloud-based solutions that we can</p>
      <p begin="00:03:18.590" end="00:03:22.300">...these together it's no longer just about these devices in the world</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.300" end="00:03:26.850">kind of working independent of one another if these devices connected to one another connected to the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.850" end="00:03:30.450">cloud and producing a solution that really exceeds the sum of</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.450" end="00:03:33.830">all parts so all these things these kind</p>
      <p begin="00:03:33.830" end="00:03:38.050">...new trends generate these new solutions and people are saying the value</p>
      <p begin="00:03:38.050" end="00:03:46.440">of these new solutions which is kind of fueling the demand for more and it's become this innovator virtuous site.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.440" end="00:03:49.500">So, the world of io...in two thousand ten just five years</p>
      <p begin="00:03:49.500" end="00:03:52.360">ago looks a lot different than the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52.360" end="00:03:55.600">world of coyote in two thousand fifteen.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.810" end="00:04:00.960">You see a much richer ecosystem we think this is accelerating considerably</p>
      <p begin="00:04:00.960" end="00:04:13.000">especially right now we think by twenty, twenty ths a look even dramatically different.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.000" end="00:04:16.860">You know, there's some laws of physics in our space and you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:16.860" end="00:04:21.000">the first graph you see moore's law...probably most of us in this room</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21.000" end="00:04:25.930">are kind of either talk to people about this or worthy year over year beneficiary</p>
      <p begin="00:04:25.930" end="00:04:31.540">of moore's law building software solutions that take advantage of the fact that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:31.540" end="00:04:36.580">computers are getting increasingly capable...yearbecause transistor density doubles there</p>
      <p begin="00:04:36.580" end="00:04:41.400">...that machine can do a little bit more every time that doubling occurs every eighteen months to a</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.400" end="00:04:47.080">couple of years on the far-right side of this slide you seewhat's called...law a</p>
      <p begin="00:04:47.080" end="00:04:51.970">...economist to think working over at stanford these days and this is a little bit different than more</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.970" end="00:04:57.090">...this isn't about transistor density this is about our and if you</p>
      <p begin="00:04:57.090" end="00:05:01.480">see the regularity of this curve and check out the beginning date of this curve</p>
      <p begin="00:05:01.480" end="00:05:05.950">it's like the late nineteen forties since the late nineteen forties</p>
      <p begin="00:05:05.950" end="00:05:11.460">our ability to do you instruction processing for a particular a</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.460" end="00:05:16.290">particular unit of energy is kind of doubling about every year-and-a-half so what that means</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.290" end="00:05:19.210">if you if you run the numbers on that you end up with</p>
      <p begin="00:05:20.340" end="00:05:25.230">...machine in ten years can do twice the work with the same battery of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:25.230" end="00:05:29.460">a machine today about every ten years we get about double</p>
      <p begin="00:05:29.460" end="00:05:34.620">battery efficiency based on the compute load...the middle there's this little thing called metcalf...bob</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.620" end="00:05:40.190">...guy that invented ethernet any came up with this law that says that the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:40.190" end="00:05:44.600">value of any communication network is proportional to the square of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:44.600" end="00:05:48.860">the number of participants of that network so every time we had another...that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.860" end="00:05:53.770">network of communication value kind of grows by another square and,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.770" end="00:05:58.440">you know, we could think about this in terms of io...things a little bit more a little bit more future</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58.440" end="00:06:02.960">e but I like to think about this and old-school way if you think about the telephone</p>
      <p begin="00:06:02.960" end="00:06:07.580">...the telephone became...super valuable communication network when you</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.580" end="00:06:12.640">could rely on the fact that everybody had one and I think we're heading that way with coyote we can rely</p>
      <p begin="00:06:12.640" end="00:06:20.900">on the fact that things just know-how to talk to each other and...the cloud.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:20.900" end="00:06:25.490">There are a lot of estimates about how big this is going to be some of them or, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:25.490" end="00:06:29.120">very grandiose some of them are conservative you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:33.150">gartner estimates that the btwenty five billion connected things by twenty,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:33.150" end="00:06:35.140">twenty.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.140" end="00:06:40.100">And, I dc is estimating a seven-point two trillion-dollar impact on the economy whatever it is you</p>
      <p begin="00:06:40.100" end="00:06:46.040">...in your crystal ball we're convinced that we're in the midst</p>
      <p begin="00:06:46.040" end="00:06:52.850">of the next generation of computing and it's going to be big either way.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:52.850" end="00:06:57.700">Let's talk about what microsoft is doing priority one of the reasons why samurai both really</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57.700" end="00:07:02.550">like working in the spaces united when I work together a lot to try and figure out what</p>
      <p begin="00:07:02.550" end="00:07:06.990">is what can we do that comprehensive ranging from the smallest devices through to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:06.990" end="00:07:11.920">large devices through to massive hyper scale...enabling our customers to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:11.920" end="00:07:17.350">really build solutions that matter to the world today so on the windows side which is</p>
      <p begin="00:07:17.350" end="00:07:22.190">where I spend most of my time we come from twenty years of history in this space through</p>
      <p begin="00:07:22.190" end="00:07:25.900">...through windows embedded your windows ce...some our past work</p>
      <p begin="00:07:25.900" end="00:07:30.920">in automotive lots of different device categories who can have an opportunity to see</p>
      <p begin="00:07:30.920" end="00:07:35.890">this space of evolve over time we made a bunch of mistakes on the way that we've learned from so</p>
      <p begin="00:07:35.890" end="00:07:42.130">we're eager to kind of bake all those learning's into what we're doing today with windows tent.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:42.130" end="00:07:46.270">One of the things that will focus on throughout several presentations on io</p>
      <p begin="00:07:46.270" end="00:07:50.380">t on windows and build this year is one platform and you heard</p>
      <p begin="00:07:50.380" end="00:07:53.930">...say that earlier today it's kind of one platform depending</p>
      <p begin="00:07:53.930" end="00:07:56.860">...matter if it's hollow lens or raspberry pies</p>
      <p begin="00:07:56.860" end="00:08:00.360">or windows desktop or phone and you can extend that the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:00.360" end="00:08:04.120">io t additions whether you're building and I apps raspberry pies</p>
      <p begin="00:08:04.120" end="00:08:08.540">that depot salmon I will show you later whether building something for this little tiny border</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08.540" end="00:08:12.370">...building something for pc phone laptop or some, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:12.370" end="00:08:15.530">mri machine atm up sales</p>
      <p begin="00:08:15.530" end="00:08:20.290">...sales terminal it's the same platform it's the same developer platform that using it's the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:20.290" end="00:08:25.590">same driver model...the same application model and it's windows so, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:25.590" end="00:08:31.090">that it's ready to go enterprises it's manageable I like to say it's enterprise ready</p>
      <p begin="00:08:31.090" end="00:08:35.310">but it's also maker friendly the fact that it's got this kind of enterprise level infrastructure</p>
      <p begin="00:08:35.310" end="00:08:40.080">built in but we're working really hard to make the developer platform very accessible to use</p>
      <p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:41.780">...you can easily construct solutions.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:43.060" end="00:08:46.240">And, one of the exciting announcements that we made</p>
      <p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:51.410">...at the windows hardware engineering conference last year is that the sm windows</p>
      <p begin="00:08:51.410" end="00:08:55.410">...core addition for the smallest class of devices will be available free</p>
      <p begin="00:08:55.410" end="00:09:01.140">for both commercial as well as noncommercial device builders thanks so on the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:01.140" end="00:09:06.720">...side where obviously very interested in helping customers build cloud-based</p>
      <p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:11.350">I ot services and solutions we have a set of services today that customers are</p>
      <p begin="00:09:11.350" end="00:09:14.330">...using in broad...deployments and,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:14.330" end="00:09:16.900">I'm going to cover today and then we have a rich roadmap that</p>
      <p begin="00:09:16.900" end="00:09:21.590">includes solutions and finished apps all of these are easy to provision to</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.590" end="00:09:25.710">use to manage they provision and minutes you page you go you</p>
      <p begin="00:09:25.710" end="00:09:30.330">...you need and very importantly for io t these solutions</p>
      <p begin="00:09:30.330" end="00:09:34.830">and are cloud are globally present because when you talk to customers they</p>
      <p begin="00:09:34.830" end="00:09:38.100">...of their io to deployments are either now or will be global</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.100" end="00:09:41.310">a global scale and customers don't want to</p>
      <p begin="00:09:41.310" end="00:09:46.990">create one solution for every region that they're in we're putting a big emphasis on</p>
      <p begin="00:09:46.990" end="00:09:51.120">end in security and privacy there was a talk earlier today by commons</p>
      <p begin="00:09:51.120" end="00:09:55.490">...about io...security fundamentals ...course have all the industry best</p>
      <p begin="00:09:55.490" end="00:10:00.150">practices...toolbox and we have some ideas for how to take it</p>
      <p begin="00:10:00.150" end="00:10:06.730">even further we will support windows in a first-class way and there's a lot of great things that we have plan on a</p>
      <p begin="00:10:06.730" end="00:10:09.420">roadmap we also support all the rich</p>
      <p begin="00:10:09.420" end="00:10:14.570">a set of devices and operating systems that exist we sort of a tag line that it's the internet</p>
      <p begin="00:10:14.570" end="00:10:19.420">your things and, that you can extract value from your things so we have rich</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.420" end="00:10:24.590">support for embed bunch versions of linux ios android and some other real</p>
      <p begin="00:10:24.590" end="00:10:28.590">time operating systems so let's talk about cashmere</p>
      <p begin="00:10:28.590" end="00:10:33.710">going to cover as your for the next few slides are going to go back to steve and,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:33.710" end="00:10:37.760">he's going to cover windows in detail ok?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:39.180" end="00:10:42.080">So, I'm going to coverio...device</p>
      <p begin="00:10:42.080" end="00:10:47.720">and cloud patterns the patterns that we tend to see again and again in io t in io</p>
      <p begin="00:10:47.720" end="00:10:52.320">t solutions also going to cover the set of services that we have today and how customers</p>
      <p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:10:58.160">are using them got a couple customer stories that are fun to talk about and then I'm going to talk about the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:58.160" end="00:11:03.060">...sweet and what we're doing with that?</p>
      <p begin="00:11:03.060" end="00:11:05.590">All right so.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:05.590" end="00:11:10.130">I ot is since it's nascent since it's a new thing and, in some ways of course it's</p>
      <p begin="00:11:10.130" end="00:11:15.050">all-new because m...been around for a long-time but there are some forces that are interesting and</p>
      <p begin="00:11:15.050" end="00:11:18.800">enter creating this phenomenon we call io...but,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:23.090">when you ask someone what I ot is you tend to get a lot of different</p>
      <p begin="00:11:23.090" end="00:11:29.820">answers based on how many people you ask so we found it really useful in...we're talking with customers to</p>
      <p begin="00:11:29.820" end="00:11:34.220">boil down and io t solution in terms of the patterns that we see and</p>
      <p begin="00:11:34.220" end="00:11:36.500">the value that customers are seeking to extract</p>
      <p begin="00:11:36.500" end="00:11:41.130">from my ot it's a good way to sort of clarify what we mean by ot</p>
      <p begin="00:11:41.130" end="00:11:46.140">...what we're doing for it so we boil it down into really three constituent parts the first</p>
      <p begin="00:11:46.140" end="00:11:52.090">part of courses around device connectivity in management the second is around analytics</p>
      <p begin="00:11:52.090" end="00:11:54.420">...finding insights and I ot data</p>
      <p begin="00:11:54.420" end="00:11:59.560">and then operational rising those and the last is having them code connect</p>
      <p begin="00:11:59.560" end="00:12:04.540">into your business and being able to see and interact with these io...solutions and I'm going to cover each one</p>
      <p begin="00:12:04.540" end="00:12:10.380">and detail so I'm going to start really simply with a empty cloud and a set</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.380" end="00:12:15.900">of devices the devices that you see over on the left-hand side are running real</p>
      <p begin="00:12:15.900" end="00:12:19.670">time operating systems today...driver based</p>
      <p begin="00:12:19.670" end="00:12:24.930">operating systems linux windows android ios and we expect</p>
      <p begin="00:12:24.930" end="00:12:29.820">this to sort of proliferate as I mentioned we do consider that</p>
      <p begin="00:12:29.820" end="00:12:32.660">...is the internet of your things so sort of come</p>
      <p begin="00:12:32.660" end="00:12:38.830">as you are we also have a cloud over on the right-hand side that I'm going to fill up with the patterns that we see</p>
      <p begin="00:12:38.830" end="00:12:42.810">...ot as well as a solutions that we've got?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:42.810" end="00:12:49.350">So, our first step in the journey is to talk through the device connectivity and management.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:49.350" end="00:12:53.070">It seems like my clippers dying.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:53.070" end="00:12:57.390">My internet of things isn't working.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:57.390" end="00:13:01.460">Thank you stayed all right so device connectivity and management actually I'll just stand over here</p>
      <p begin="00:13:01.460" end="00:13:07.690">and stuff and say...yeah, totally...I don't...job that's right so,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:07.690" end="00:13:13.590">device connectivity in management so, some devices actually communicate directly with a cloud</p>
      <p begin="00:13:13.590" end="00:13:19.710">...very common pattern today we have a service for this as your event tubs</p>
      <p begin="00:13:19.710" end="00:13:23.870">it extremely high scale telemetry ingestion service you basically</p>
      <p begin="00:13:23.870" end="00:13:26.290">send messages over http.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:26.290" end="00:13:30.710">Or am...p which is the advance message queuing protocol each event</p>
      <p begin="00:13:30.710" end="00:13:35.480">ub supports one million unique publishers and supports over a</p>
      <p begin="00:13:35.480" end="00:13:40.300">gigabyte per second...we've had this in-service since beginning of the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:40.300" end="00:13:45.050">year generally available preview before that today on average we're doing</p>
      <p begin="00:13:45.050" end="00:13:49.120">about eighteen billion messages per day worldwide through all of the event</p>
      <p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:53.730">tubs that we have this is changing pretty rapidly about a month ago when I was presenting this</p>
      <p begin="00:13:53.730" end="00:13:58.710">...at ten billion so, we're seeing a very sharp increase in the number of both devices</p>
      <p begin="00:13:58.710" end="00:14:03.690">that are connected as well as other services that are connected because you can use event tabs for</p>
      <p begin="00:14:03.690" end="00:14:09.620">other things including telemetry from the web sites and things like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:09.620" end="00:14:14.490">We're doing about sixty terabytes per day ingesting into asher worldwide to these ot</p>
      <p begin="00:14:14.490" end="00:14:19.720">hubs as well so this is an interesting pattern were devices are sending telemetry</p>
      <p begin="00:14:19.720" end="00:14:25.260">to a cloud gateway it's not the only pattern in fact some devices</p>
      <p begin="00:14:25.260" end="00:14:31.090">don't belong on the open internet there's some devices that are very low powered where if you put them on the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:31.090" end="00:14:36.530">open internet and receive commands for many inbound traffic you probably not</p>
      <p begin="00:14:36.530" end="00:14:40.970">going to like what happens next to that device so very common pattern that you see and io</p>
      <p begin="00:14:40.970" end="00:14:44.810">...is that of an intermediate field gateway and this is</p>
      <p begin="00:14:44.810" end="00:14:49.270">much of a pattern as it is a device so, for example, we consider a cell</p>
      <p begin="00:14:49.270" end="00:14:54.110">...to be a field gateway and there's customers that are delivering solutions over bluetooth</p>
      <p begin="00:14:54.110" end="00:14:58.200">...to sensors on devices that connect through</p>
      <p begin="00:14:58.200" end="00:15:03.950">smartphone there's also of course industrial-strength routers and feel gateways</p>
      <p begin="00:15:03.950" end="00:15:07.570">foreman interesting security boundary as well they can provide a sense advice</p>
      <p begin="00:15:07.570" end="00:15:13.530">or us capability of isolation in the security talk we talk about this pattern we call</p>
      <p begin="00:15:13.530" end="00:15:18.360">...cystic community communication where the feel gateway is responsible</p>
      <p begin="00:15:18.360" end="00:15:23.710">for the isolation of those devices another interesting pattern that we see is that</p>
      <p begin="00:15:23.710" end="00:15:28.530">feel gateways do protocol adaptation and translation so in into m</p>
      <p begin="00:15:28.530" end="00:15:33.520">and I...been around for a long-time as I said earlier there's a lot of protocols including custom</p>
      <p begin="00:15:33.520" end="00:15:38.100">ones...customers have invented or of used a lot of them don't belong on</p>
      <p begin="00:15:38.100" end="00:15:42.990">the open internet so, protocol adaptation is a really interesting pattern</p>
      <p begin="00:15:42.990" end="00:15:49.590">for extracting value from those devices that have already been deployed so,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:49.590" end="00:15:53.980">this is sort of the first part of this device to cloud patterns and customers</p>
      <p begin="00:15:53.980" end="00:15:56.920">do find value in this and like I said many of the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:56.920" end="00:16:01.560">examples that we've got today that I'm going to be talking about uses pattern of</p>
      <p begin="00:16:01.560" end="00:16:06.490">a cloud gateway but there's additional needs that we have an io t?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:06.490" end="00:16:10.840">You have the need for command and control to be able to issue a command to a device and to be able to know</p>
      <p begin="00:16:10.840" end="00:16:16.660">whether received it you need to be able to keep track of the identity of all these devices and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:16.660" end="00:16:20.300">preserved that identity when you're replacing devices you need</p>
      <p begin="00:16:20.300" end="00:16:25.580">...device registry that includes all the capabilities and assets and things like that the device</p>
      <p begin="00:16:25.580" end="00:16:30.120">has and you also need device management as we said in our soc in</p>
      <p begin="00:16:30.120" end="00:16:35.230">our security talk what you can't update you can't secure so being able to update</p>
      <p begin="00:16:35.230" end="00:16:40.420">operating systems and firmware and software that's running on devices is very important</p>
      <p begin="00:16:40.420" end="00:16:44.830">and io...and of course it ranges in your security</p>
      <p begin="00:16:44.830" end="00:16:49.880">...needs will of course range but we think device management is a very important part of bio</p>
      <p begin="00:16:49.880" end="00:16:54.380">...so I'm excited to announcer coming with the asher ot</p>
      <p begin="00:16:54.380" end="00:16:59.890">...will be previewing this year we have an additional service that will be available with the ot</p>
      <p begin="00:16:59.890" end="00:17:03.910">...the ot hub and there's a talk on this is well this week so the io</p>
      <p begin="00:17:03.910" end="00:17:07.620">t hub is supports bidirectional device</p>
      <p begin="00:17:07.620" end="00:17:12.470">to cloud connectivity it will support up to ten million devices so...sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:17:12.470" end="00:17:17.460">...extreme scale io...ingestion service and command...</p>
      <p begin="00:17:17.460" end="00:17:22.820">command service exports command control it has a device registry as</p>
      <p begin="00:17:22.820" end="00:17:27.830">well as maintains device identity and it will support device management so you'll be able</p>
      <p begin="00:17:27.830" end="00:17:32.810">to manager devices which is really important when you start getting different scale of audiotape you don't</p>
      <p begin="00:17:32.810" end="00:17:38.930">actually want to go around and flash devices because there's a lot of them ...support http and</p>
      <p begin="00:17:38.930" end="00:17:45.590">amp as well as in q tt and extensibility mechanism.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:45.590" end="00:17:49.320">So, labels these interaction patterns right sam where one device might</p>
      <p begin="00:17:49.320" end="00:17:52.240">...some signals send that to a cloud service and</p>
      <p begin="00:17:52.240" end="00:17:56.060">...service can maybe predict that something is going to go roaring and have some other</p>
      <p begin="00:17:56.060" end="00:17:56.560">devices?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:58.300" end="00:18:01.210">Act accordingly absolutely so,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:01.210" end="00:18:06.100">as part of our commitment were not just building cloud gateways and cloud components</p>
      <p begin="00:18:06.100" end="00:18:09.650">...also delivering st...for devices so,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:09.650" end="00:18:14.100">we'll have an open-source agent framework ...will be available at</p>
      <p begin="00:18:14.100" end="00:18:18.260">it runs on a variety of real time operating systems a variety of linux</p>
      <p begin="00:18:18.260" end="00:18:22.200">variance windows of...android ios and,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:22.200" end="00:18:24.970">like I said this will be...open-source project</p>
      <p begin="00:18:24.970" end="00:18:30.040">...will continue to innovate it's easy to use is not required this is just something that</p>
      <p begin="00:18:30.040" end="00:18:33.670">makes it easy to get started we support standard protocols</p>
      <p begin="00:18:33.670" end="00:18:39.070">...cloud gateway so the way this is built is there's a set of cross-platform</p>
      <p begin="00:18:39.070" end="00:18:44.470">c code that we've got...as well as like any good cross-platform code we've got</p>
      <p begin="00:18:44.470" end="00:18:49.290">it os abstraction layerwith the set of os bindings and the nice thing about this approach</p>
      <p begin="00:18:49.290" end="00:18:55.510">is that to move to another platform all you have to do is create a new os</p>
      <p begin="00:18:55.510" end="00:19:00.070">...an example of what we abstract in the operating systems are things that are different</p>
      <p begin="00:19:00.070" end="00:19:05.020">like memory management threading and networking and things like that and then will provide a set of</p>
      <p begin="00:19:05.020" end="00:19:09.890">...api on top both see api net api is java api</p>
      <p begin="00:19:09.890" end="00:19:15.240">...as well as a node library for javascript api is the see api</p>
      <p begin="00:19:15.240" end="00:19:16.370">our providing one</p>
      <p begin="00:19:16.370" end="00:19:21.160">...run in very memory constrain devices rc api actually</p>
      <p begin="00:19:21.160" end="00:19:26.360">runs and kilobytes of memory not megabytes of memory so very small and yet has all that</p>
      <p begin="00:19:26.360" end="00:19:30.960">rich functionality there's a lot of functionality built into this batching</p>
      <p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:38.370">retry the extensible encoding extensible serialism asian and things like that?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:38.370" end="00:19:44.000">Array moving on so most folks don't wake up in the morning and say I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:48.550">connect a bunch of devices to the cloud just for fun there's something that they want to get out of it</p>
      <p begin="00:19:48.550" end="00:19:56.170">and this will...and, here's what most folks so,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:56.170" end="00:20:00.690">on the device connectivity and management there's a lot of interesting things companies are doing already</p>
      <p begin="00:20:00.690" end="00:20:06.270">by just monitoring remote devices a great example is fleet management if you can</p>
      <p begin="00:20:06.270" end="00:20:11.840">...your fleets...were all your things are you can keep control of them but,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:11.840" end="00:20:15.260">what we see is that customers the value that they're starting to extract alibi</p>
      <p begin="00:20:15.260" end="00:20:19.110">...starts to really shine when you get into analytics</p>
      <p begin="00:20:19.110" end="00:20:23.300">and operational rising those analytics so let me give some examples, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:23.300" end="00:20:26.970">in fleet management there's a really interesting thing is whereas if, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:26.970" end="00:20:32.130">...all of your fleet where if, you know,...the rapture fleet or travelling on and,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:32.130" end="00:20:36.830">the incidence that your fleet has on those routes like and things get stolen you can</p>
      <p begin="00:20:36.830" end="00:20:43.180">start doing intelligent routing and traffic routing and things like that the pattern that you tend</p>
      <p begin="00:20:43.180" end="00:20:47.620">to see in this stage of our journey?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:47.620" end="00:20:49.300">Looks like I'm going to have to go back to the keyboard.</p>

      <p begin="00:21:47.160" end="00:21:51.540">what how much weight was in it and the operating temperature of things you can much</p>
      <p begin="00:21:51.540" end="00:21:56.080">musing machine learning you-can much more accurately predict how much servicing it needs and</p>
      <p begin="00:21:56.080" end="00:22:00.890">...in most cases reduce the amount of servicing while providing better up times and offering</p>
      <p begin="00:22:00.890" end="00:22:06.170">up time guarantees that's a good example of finding those insights it's not just enough to</p>
      <p begin="00:22:06.170" end="00:22:10.980">finals insights once you have those insights you actually have to operational...those you need to do</p>
      <p begin="00:22:10.980" end="00:22:15.690">something in real-time we have to services today for this we have as</p>
      <p begin="00:22:15.690" end="00:22:19.540">your stream analytics which is a really cool service on complex</p>
      <p begin="00:22:19.540" end="00:22:24.070">event processing that has a really nice simple sequel syntax where you can treat</p>
      <p begin="00:22:24.070" end="00:22:28.120">an extreme volume telemetry scale as if it were static table</p>
      <p begin="00:22:28.120" end="00:22:31.250">...issue sequel queries that includes tumbling windows</p>
      <p begin="00:22:31.250" end="00:22:34.110">and averages and things like that and then you can go and</p>
      <p begin="00:22:34.110" end="00:22:39.310">saved those on the to blob storage we also have a measure hd insight</p>
      <p begin="00:22:39.310" end="00:22:44.070">...storm which is simply apache storm as a hosted offering so,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:44.070" end="00:22:46.770">this is really interesting because right because everyone</p>
      <p begin="00:22:46.770" end="00:22:51.860">...adders the windows cloud measures very friendly to open-source and linux it's a</p>
      <p begin="00:22:51.860" end="00:22:56.120">great growing workload that we've got a measure html site storm is a great complex</p>
      <p begin="00:22:56.120" end="00:22:59.740">and that processing framework so, we fully support that...io</p>
      <p begin="00:22:59.740" end="00:23:06.360">to solutions as well and then the last part of our tour around the analytics an operation...</p>
      <p begin="00:23:06.360" end="00:23:11.210">insights is so that pattern works really well that complex</p>
      <p begin="00:23:11.210" end="00:23:15.690">...processing works really well if you're dealing with homogenous sets and things</p>
      <p begin="00:23:15.690" end="00:23:20.770">like elevators orf a fleet and you're and you're, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:20.770" end="00:23:25.290">what you're looking for when devices in the real-world start to form hierarchies</p>
      <p begin="00:23:25.290" end="00:23:27.690">and graphs things start to get complicated like</p>
      <p begin="00:23:27.690" end="00:23:31.400">...there's logical parent-child relationships so imagine, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:31.400" end="00:23:35.980">if you're doing building maintenance forcompany this the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:35.980" end="00:23:40.940">scale of microsoft where you've got buildings all over the globe campuses all over the globe</p>
      <p begin="00:23:40.940" end="00:23:45.250">each campus has a collection of buildings in each building as a collection of room's...</p>
      <p begin="00:23:45.250" end="00:23:50.200">as collection of sensors which they really do for all sorts of things from temperature to movement</p>
      <p begin="00:23:50.200" end="00:23:53.830">or whatever and you want to implement essentially manage system for</p>
      <p begin="00:23:53.830" end="00:23:59.120">doing things like turning on the lights when...critical amount of people are in the building to</p>
      <p begin="00:23:59.120" end="00:24:03.950">do that one approach to do that is to...is to tag every single</p>
      <p begin="00:24:03.950" end="00:24:08.950">sensor and then just somehow be able to aggregate sensors a</p>
      <p begin="00:24:08.950" end="00:24:13.150">much more natural way to do that is to build an object model and to take</p>
      <p begin="00:24:13.150" end="00:24:17.280">...that high-volume telemetry scale and bind it to that object model and</p>
      <p begin="00:24:17.280" end="00:24:19.750">have that object model be able to be distributed</p>
      <p begin="00:24:19.750" end="00:24:24.620">throughout a cluster so today we announced service fabric which is our next generation platforms</p>
      <p begin="00:24:24.620" end="00:24:28.080">...service empowers a lot of the services that we do</p>
      <p begin="00:24:28.080" end="00:24:32.760">including event tubs coyote hub and document db and sequel server and</p>
      <p begin="00:24:32.760" end="00:24:37.460">...time and a whole bunch more and it's a massive scale service that elastic</p>
      <p begin="00:24:37.460" end="00:24:41.640">...scales up and we think it's very important for the internet of things in</p>
      <p begin="00:24:41.640" end="00:24:47.110">this particular pattern it allows you to runsort of distributed business logic</p>
      <p begin="00:24:47.110" end="00:24:52.790">a across all of the...state of your io t devices?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:52.790" end="00:24:58.730">So, moving on...the next phase of our journey last the last phase</p>
      <p begin="00:24:58.730" end="00:25:03.350">...course need to be able to visualize data coming from the solutions and control</p>
      <p begin="00:25:03.350" end="00:25:08.170">these solutions these solutions don't exist in a vacuum they exist</p>
      <p begin="00:25:08.170" end="00:25:10.120">in businesses so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:10.120" end="00:25:14.660">when you detect that and elevator needs servicing ahead of schedule it's not just about knowing</p>
      <p begin="00:25:14.660" end="00:25:20.120">that it's about opus opening a customer relations record it's about rolling</p>
      <p begin="00:25:20.120" end="00:25:24.100">truck it's potentially about ordering apart so there's a there's a workflow</p>
      <p begin="00:25:24.100" end="00:25:28.450">...required so we supporta bunch of services for this from dynamics</p>
      <p begin="00:25:28.450" end="00:25:32.210">tobits talk servers and to notification...we also have rich third-party</p>
      <p begin="00:25:32.210" end="00:25:37.450">extensibilityfor all sorts of other business process workflow and,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:37.450" end="00:25:40.810">then of course we have app service and websites...mobile services and</p>
      <p begin="00:25:40.810" end="00:25:44.910">abridge services so this kind of gives us gives you an idea of how we</p>
      <p begin="00:25:44.910" end="00:25:49.980">ci ot and sort of the end-to-end that we have the...that we have on io</p>
      <p begin="00:25:49.980" end="00:25:55.740">...what customers are doing with it so if we move on so these are the services that we've</p>
      <p begin="00:25:55.740" end="00:26:01.460">got today we've got the set of services for machine learning to stream analytics</p>
      <p begin="00:26:01.460" end="00:26:06.330">to hd insight data factory and customers are building on all of these today I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:06.330" end="00:26:11.870">go through a few examples...I'm going to talk about how we're taking this to the next level so the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:11.870" end="00:26:15.520">first opener customer visit is that of</p>
      <p begin="00:26:15.520" end="00:26:20.440">rockwell automation so rockwell as a great company it's been in business for a long</p>
      <p begin="00:26:20.440" end="00:26:25.370">long-time and they're making their journey and io...with us so,</p>

      <p begin="00:26:35.470" end="00:26:39.890">a lot of really interesting things they can do like they can tell</p>
      <p begin="00:26:39.890" end="00:26:45.230">maintenance history over time they can schedule service visits before anything happens</p>
      <p begin="00:26:45.230" end="00:26:49.550">so you sort of a pattern that you'll see again and again and I...is around predictive something</p>
      <p begin="00:26:49.550" end="00:26:55.320">predicted maintenance predictive stocking using the cloud to predict and drive</p>

      <p begin="00:27:02.360" end="00:27:07.650">the stanford linear accelerator is doing a project with us as well</p>
      <p begin="00:27:07.650" end="00:27:10.320">...streaming io t data through event...industry</p>

      <p begin="00:27:22.060" end="00:27:29.180">So,no, as your io t presentation would be complete without connected...</p>
      <p begin="00:27:29.180" end="00:27:34.730">So, this is a true story so, we have a great partnership with widgets ewf</p>
      <p begin="00:27:34.730" end="00:27:39.170">widgets too is very much and I ot they have a lot of rich</p>

      <p begin="00:27:50.940" end="00:27:57.130">hydra panic labs control by machine learning they have another one which is connected cow and I</p>
      <p begin="00:27:57.130" end="00:28:01.970">love connected cal because to me it really illustrates what the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:01.970" end="00:28:06.610">as the innovation that we're going to seeing-eye ot and the unpredictability that we're going to see and I</p>
      <p begin="00:28:06.610" end="00:28:11.730">ot ok so here's how...cowards so it turns out when cows are</p>
      <p begin="00:28:11.730" end="00:28:17.690">...only an asterisk for a very short window and if you miss that window you have to wait so</p>
      <p begin="00:28:17.690" end="00:28:21.330">...what fidgety...was that if you put an</p>
      <p begin="00:28:21.330" end="00:28:26.640">industrial grade speedometer on a cal and monitor its steps?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:31.510">You can predict using machine learning you can project with a very high accuracy about ninety eight</p>
      <p begin="00:28:31.510" end="00:28:37.400">percent when it's time to make more cows turns out that's very important and,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:37.400" end="00:28:41.940">it also turns out that two percent of false positives tend to be when the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:41.940" end="00:28:45.320">cows got loose so you kinda want to know that too so,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:45.320" end="00:28:49.740">connected houses a great example from fidgety this is actually been deployed to I think</p>
      <p begin="00:28:49.740" end="00:28:54.890">it's ten farms in japan with really significant heard production</p>
      <p begin="00:28:54.890" end="00:28:58.610">inc improvements ...yes...</p>
      <p begin="00:29:00.710" end="00:29:04.250">So, that's connected...and that really is sort of illustrates the bret for us</p>
      <p begin="00:29:04.250" end="00:29:08.010">and bio t and the unpredictability.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:08.010" end="00:29:12.840">So, for learning more it build we've got a few talks it happened today they will be available</p>
      <p begin="00:29:12.840" end="00:29:16.490">on-demand the microsoft architecture for internet of things I</p>
      <p begin="00:29:16.490" end="00:29:20.960">ut security fundamentals we've got a great talk on events hubs as well as stream analytics</p>
      <p begin="00:29:20.960" end="00:29:24.990">...mellon our by encourage you to check those out</p>
      <p begin="00:29:24.990" end="00:29:30.640">so we've also mentioned that coming soon is the...talk a little bit more about</p>
      <p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:35.560">that right now so today what customers are doing is you're taking the as</p>
      <p begin="00:29:35.560" end="00:29:40.550">your ot services and I'll go and provision quickly and I ot hub...stream analytics instance</p>
      <p begin="00:29:40.550" end="00:29:45.150">and connect them together and we think we can do better we think we can make it so that because we see</p>
      <p begin="00:29:45.150" end="00:29:49.390">a repeated pattern of use cases that customers are doing from</p>
      <p begin="00:29:49.390" end="00:29:54.360">remote monitoring to asset management to predictive maintenance and what we're going to do</p>
      <p begin="00:29:54.360" end="00:29:58.920">any address ot...is allow customers and the as...portal to simply go</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.920" end="00:30:03.340">...provision those directly and will orchestrate all the services if you're familiar with the as</p>
      <p begin="00:30:03.340" end="00:30:06.170">a resource manager these are...resource manager templates</p>
      <p begin="00:30:06.170" end="00:30:11.540">that provision and we do any code customization that's...these are also finished</p>
      <p begin="00:30:11.540" end="00:30:16.820">absence so they promote they include a set of web app web assets for</p>
      <p begin="00:30:16.820" end="00:30:21.760">monitoring managing and things like that better then also customizable because one of the things</p>
      <p begin="00:30:21.760" end="00:30:26.070">we found is that customers really want the sort of finished apps but then they also really want to</p>
      <p begin="00:30:26.070" end="00:30:31.350">customize them so as you rotate sweetest sort of the best of both worlds there it also provide</p>
      <p begin="00:30:31.350" end="00:30:34.670">...predictable billing so it's very easy to model out your</p>
      <p begin="00:30:34.670" end="00:30:38.780">cobs especially you grow to scale and then finally the nice part about</p>
      <p begin="00:30:38.780" end="00:30:43.010">this is that the same thing that you do your proof of concept with</p>
      <p begin="00:30:43.010" end="00:30:48.570">...scale-up to those ten million devices are beyond we will include a free addition of</p>
      <p begin="00:30:48.570" end="00:30:51.990">these for a certain number of devices so that you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:51.990" end="00:30:57.270">if your maker and you want to get started with...to be super easy to...if your business</p>

      <p begin="00:31:10.520" end="00:31:15.660">as opposed to I started with something to prove a case and now I have to switch systems</p>
      <p begin="00:31:15.660" end="00:31:22.240">ok so let's go one more all right so I'm going to switch to quick demo I'm just going</p>
      <p begin="00:31:22.240" end="00:31:33.820">...in here?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:33.820" end="00:31:38.470">This is then me all right so I've got a couple I got</p>

      <p begin="00:33:05.920" end="00:33:09.480">There we go okay so, we have a set of devices so this is sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:33:09.480" end="00:33:14.650">affect little fictitious scenario where each one of these devices represents a vending</p>

      <p begin="00:34:05.570" end="00:34:08.000">then what I can do is I can actually go back into this</p>
      <p begin="00:34:08.000" end="00:34:12.360">an issue commands backed into the back to the device and this is actually using and</p>

      <p begin="00:34:16.770" end="00:34:21.130">will support rich grouping and tagging and batch commands and all that but today I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:34:21.130" end="00:34:25.460">to today I'm going to start with something very simple and I'm just going to set a new</p>

      <p begin="00:34:29.950" end="00:34:42.180">fast and over on thearm device you're going to see the price change?</p>
      <p begin="00:34:42.180" end="00:34:46.930">We got a new battery great.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:46.930" end="00:34:58.780">And, it's not right now and I'm going to find out why in a second.</p>

      <p begin="00:36:59.240" end="00:37:02.110">as a matter-of-fact one of the things that we kind of mind</p>
      <p begin="00:37:02.110" end="00:37:05.160">...wanted to do is get the operating systems</p>
      <p begin="00:37:05.160" end="00:37:11.070">done enough to be able to enable folks to build real devices and,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.070" end="00:37:15.200">do real workloads but then also cannot wait to be able to get</p>
      <p begin="00:37:15.200" end="00:37:22.800">...soon as we get to that point so that we can get some feedback that we can use...prioritize...work here and?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:22.800" end="00:37:25.930">Maybe...just depress it really hard I think I'm going to try that I can I</p>
      <p begin="00:37:25.930" end="00:37:30.490">can which were so, when we talk about windows...</p>
      <p begin="00:37:30.490" end="00:37:35.710">space we think about a few different things that windows ten brings?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:35.710" end="00:37:40.660">That are different than what you might find with other operating systems in</p>
      <p begin="00:37:40.660" end="00:37:44.500">space one is this idea of a single consistent platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:46.040" end="00:37:50.730">And, again, one operating system that scales across devices whether it's a</p>

      <p begin="00:38:04.690" end="00:38:09.260">throughout the conference is the ability to literally take the same application</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09.260" end="00:38:13.850">and simply change the target from my local machine to my phone to my raspberry</p>
      <p begin="00:38:13.850" end="00:38:18.530">...board to a windows server and have that same application run across this</p>
      <p begin="00:38:18.530" end="00:38:24.750">broad-range of devices even to an xbox or hollow...the other thing that we've done is converge</p>

      <p begin="00:38:30.070" end="00:38:34.600">being a hardware developer in the windows ecosystem was probably more difficult than it</p>
      <p begin="00:38:34.600" end="00:38:40.160">needed to be because if you wanted to support your hardware on windows, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:45.510">desktop addition of windows, windows embedded standard there was one driver model</p>
      <p begin="00:38:45.510" end="00:38:50.500">you would use to go do that...you want...your harbored be supported for windows mobile devices for</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50.500" end="00:38:54.810">phones that was a different driver model if you want to build small devices may</p>
      <p begin="00:38:54.810" end="00:39:00.550">be on windows ce that was yet another one so you know, I apologize that we made</p>
      <p begin="00:39:00.550" end="00:39:04.620">...right multiple different drivers to kinda get one piece of hardware working</p>
      <p begin="00:39:04.620" end="00:39:09.520">our ecosystem but I'm happy to say that we're well on the way to getting that address now one</p>

      <p begin="00:39:27.130" end="00:39:32.020">solutions at the same time we want the devices themselves to be awesome to impart of</p>
      <p begin="00:39:32.020" end="00:39:36.720">building awesome devices is I don't just want devices necessarily better sitting passively in the</p>

      <p begin="00:44:31.040" end="00:44:35.460">interesting releases along the way now I think ce still has</p>
      <p begin="00:44:36.930" end="00:44:41.890">some high-value for customers because it does things that windows...won't do so,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:41.890" end="00:44:48.180">for example, if you need to build an operating system that has some hard realtime constraints...union operating system that</p>
      <p begin="00:44:48.180" end="00:44:53.080">incorporates those constraints ceo is the way that you would still do that so if you're doing, you</p>
      <p begin="00:44:53.080" end="00:44:57.990">know, some industrial device that has safety constraints that says no really within ten milliseconds</p>
      <p begin="00:44:57.990" end="00:45:02.830">...arm...the stopper cuts the human next two-and-half those kinds of things yes you want to build</p>
      <p begin="00:45:02.830" end="00:45:08.210">those things on an operating system with real time constraints what's more there's a huge ecosystem of</p>
      <p begin="00:45:08.210" end="00:45:13.330">software hardware...built on ce those will continue and we are</p>
      <p begin="00:45:13.330" end="00:45:17.560">investing in tools to enable a lot of those see codes to move over to</p>
      <p begin="00:45:17.560" end="00:45:22.630">windows ten I talked a little bit about this at the windows hardware engineering conference</p>
      <p begin="00:45:22.630" end="00:45:27.330">last month and demonstrated some of the tools that we will use to enable developers to</p>
      <p begin="00:45:27.330" end="00:45:29.540">kind of migrate along the way...</p>
      <p begin="00:45:29.540" end="00:45:34.240">last year this conference I also announced this windows on devices program and we started with the</p>
      <p begin="00:45:34.240" end="00:45:39.360">intel galileo bored and I'm just curious how many of you in the audience the did any of you do you get to</p>
      <p begin="00:45:39.360" end="00:45:44.380">...this galileo...folks the audience that's cool so, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.380" end="00:45:49.320">we were really excited to get windows going on the smallest class of devices</p>
      <p begin="00:45:49.320" end="00:45:53.630">and now we're seeing this windows on devices again is just folded in as a part of windows</p>
      <p begin="00:45:53.630" end="00:46:01.930">ten so windows ten just naturally enables me to target the sm class of device?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:01.930" end="00:46:04.430">Windows ten-ninety comes in three additions</p>
      <p begin="00:46:04.430" end="00:46:09.340">so as I talk about them from the outer most down to the innermost</p>
      <p begin="00:46:09.340" end="00:46:15.470">the outer most is for the largest class of devices and effectively it's a it's a</p>
      <p begin="00:46:15.470" end="00:46:20.420">version of windows enterprise that has the io t bits necessary</p>
      <p begin="00:46:20.420" end="00:46:25.200">for a customization to lock it down to particular apps to lock it down</p>
      <p begin="00:46:25.200" end="00:46:30.240">to particular peripherals so that you can take what is effectively an instance of windows and make</p>
      <p begin="00:46:30.240" end="00:46:34.330">...vending machine or make it atm machine.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:34.330" end="00:46:38.520">The system requirements are that of the desktop windows system</p>

      <p begin="00:50:10.930" end="00:50:16.120">So, I've got a visual studio...actually thank you visual studio so what I've got</p>
      <p begin="00:50:16.120" end="00:50:21.260">here's I've got a visual studio universal application this is</p>
      <p begin="00:50:21.260" end="00:50:25.750">an application that theoretically I could run on any on any windows device but I'm going to run</p>

      <p begin="00:50:40.920" end="00:50:44.650">Can happen ok so I've got a cool one but I just want to show you the</p>
      <p begin="00:50:44.650" end="00:50:48.840">...board for just a minute kind of introduce you to this bear bore this raspberry</p>

      <p begin="00:50:58.430" end="00:51:03.540">...video out html video out so that if I have</p>
      <p begin="00:51:03.540" end="00:51:08.330">...to project video I can do that from this device I've got ethernet I've got</p>
      <p begin="00:51:08.330" end="00:51:13.220">usb ports...I can connect the camera this device there's a serial port on board</p>
      <p begin="00:51:13.220" end="00:51:17.480">with this device they're a bunch of io pins here along the top that I would</p>
      <p begin="00:51:17.480" end="00:51:22.180">use to connect hardware and then drive that hardware via these io pins</p>
      <p begin="00:51:22.180" end="00:51:27.920">...running a broad com are based processor so let me switch away from this</p>
      <p begin="00:51:27.920" end="00:51:31.870">board and let me show you this kind of very cool board that's in a fits</p>
      <p begin="00:51:31.870" end="00:51:35.960">in a nice plexiglass case so this is exactly the same raspberry</p>
      <p begin="00:51:35.960" end="00:51:39.370">...chord but in a nice case and I've got a</p>
      <p begin="00:51:39.370" end="00:51:43.680">little shield that goes with it if I can show you that so then I've got a little whether</p>
      <p begin="00:51:43.680" end="00:51:47.910">shield that's wired to this and this whether she'll has sensors on it that will</p>
      <p begin="00:51:47.910" end="00:51:51.780">take the ambient barometric pressure and the ambient temperature</p>
      <p begin="00:51:51.780" end="00:51:56.290">and the ambient humidity and I can read those things through</p>
      <p begin="00:51:56.290" end="00:52:00.970">...squared see on the on the io...on the raspberry pie and I can, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:00.970" end="00:52:08.260">I can do interesting things with my little home-grown weather st so now let me...to visual studio?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:08.260" end="00:52:13.930">Very nice quick transition and I want to show you a little bit of the code</p>
      <p begin="00:52:13.930" end="00:52:16.570">for this application just to give you a feel for what it</p>
      <p begin="00:52:16.570" end="00:52:21.350">...requires to build something like this so in this case what we've done is I think in this</p>
      <p begin="00:52:21.350" end="00:52:26.660">whether shield and I've got want to show you a little bit of the code the set this</p>
      <p begin="00:52:26.660" end="00:52:31.700">up so what I've done is I've got this gps audio controller class.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:31.700" end="00:52:34.940">And, this is built into windows so gps iowa's</p>
      <p begin="00:52:34.940" end="00:52:38.750">a built-in capability of the windows universal platform are the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:38.750" end="00:52:42.520">universe windows platform I get the default dpi gps audio</p>
      <p begin="00:52:42.520" end="00:52:47.110">...there's only one in this case and then using that I can then start</p>
      <p begin="00:52:47.110" end="00:52:52.220">to configure read and write the gps audio pansto be able to begin a</p>
      <p begin="00:52:52.220" end="00:52:57.820">conversation with this particular shield so kind of doing some initial</p>
      <p begin="00:52:57.820" end="00:53:04.520">...configuration writing some data to the pins and once I've done this</p>
      <p begin="00:53:04.520" end="00:53:09.220">is kind of the one-time configuration for the device once I've kind of configured this device and the shield</p>
      <p begin="00:53:09.220" end="00:53:14.110">for use then I can just go ahead and use and read the data from the shield so</p>
      <p begin="00:53:14.110" end="00:53:19.370">code like this would typically be represented as a library that</p>
      <p begin="00:53:19.370" end="00:53:22.790">usually the shield manufacture would offer you and say hey here's</p>
      <p begin="00:53:22.790" end="00:53:26.685">the library provides a nice class that you can just kinda say you</p>
      <p begin="00:53:26.685" end="00:53:32.220">know, shield dot temperature that sort of thing and be able to read those values out.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:32.220" end="00:53:35.630">If I switch over I just wanted show you how I might be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:53:35.630" end="00:53:40.240">read a property from that so you can see this thing as a property this classes a property called</p>
      <p begin="00:53:40.240" end="00:53:46.170">raw pressure and now you're getting into kind of hardware is ville</p>
      <p begin="00:53:46.170" end="00:53:50.810">where it begins to look like well, you know, if a hybrid is this a little bit as a so now I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:53:50.810" end="00:53:54.510">getting some specific data from this particular shield sensor</p>
      <p begin="00:53:54.510" end="00:54:01.080">and I'm interpreting that data here as in this case a raw measure.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:01.080" end="00:54:03.360">If I just kinda if I just kind of scroll forward</p>
      <p begin="00:54:03.360" end="00:54:08.110">here just want to show you a couple more things I found it was interesting</p>
      <p begin="00:54:08.110" end="00:54:13.920">that the that the altitude was a calculation of barometric pressure so when you see</p>
      <p begin="00:54:13.920" end="00:54:18.740">this application run sometimes you'll see that it looks like we're in death valley because the</p>
      <p begin="00:54:18.740" end="00:54:22.290">...shows below sea level and that's because it's not really,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:22.290" end="00:54:25.250">you know, using a gps to measure altitude or anything like that</p>
      <p begin="00:54:25.250" end="00:54:30.270">it's just using a default calculation based on barometric pressure.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:30.270" end="00:54:34.940">Scrolling forward.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:34.940" end="00:54:39.780">What we've done here is created the shield class that encompasses all of these</p>
      <p begin="00:54:39.780" end="00:54:45.050">all of these attributes on the shield and then we have this whether data structure where...</p>
      <p begin="00:54:45.050" end="00:54:50.280">whether data structure to package up this data and be able to show in the user interface</p>
      <p begin="00:54:50.280" end="00:54:56.320">or do other interesting things with this application?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:56.320" end="00:55:00.360">Now the way the way we've got this working it's kind of interesting</p>
      <p begin="00:55:00.360" end="00:55:05.060">we're writing all of this data out to a file so it's kind of kind of old-school</p>
      <p begin="00:55:05.060" end="00:55:10.340">synchronization the data reading sits in a continuous continuously</p>
      <p begin="00:55:10.340" end="00:55:14.920">running background task so universal platform capability to have this task</p>
      <p begin="00:55:14.920" end="00:55:19.690">...t device that always runs that never goes away just keeps running and</p>
      <p begin="00:55:19.690" end="00:55:24.220">that's what's reading the sensor values about once a second and then periodically</p>
      <p begin="00:55:25.270" end="00:55:29.980">or for each reading in fact we take that and we stored away to a file and then</p>
      <p begin="00:55:29.980" end="00:55:34.860">the user interface for this application which I'll show you simply looks at that file and then outputs the</p>
      <p begin="00:55:34.860" end="00:55:37.250">content that file to be able to say</p>
      <p begin="00:55:37.250" end="00:55:46.640">...the what the current values are let me.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:46.640" end="00:55:51.470">Yeah,...there's a piece of this that I want to show you that has to do with the cloud before I do that</p>
      <p begin="00:55:51.470" end="00:55:55.620">I just want to run this p so running it really is a simple as, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:55.620" end="00:56:00.300">hitting at five...clicking the green arrow in visual studio this is a windows computer this</p>
      <p begin="00:56:00.300" end="00:56:05.220">little raspberry pi so things like remote debugging that we can take for granted in the windows</p>
      <p begin="00:56:05.220" end="00:56:07.860">...those things we can continue to take them for granted</p>
      <p begin="00:56:07.860" end="00:56:15.300">...world so I'm just going to hit the button here get this guy running.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:15.300" end="00:56:18.820">It would be great if we waited until this worked and then.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:18.820" end="00:56:21.830">...would...more appropriate time to clap and,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:21.830" end="00:56:27.250">then let's switch over to input five and let's make sure that</p>
      <p begin="00:56:27.250" end="00:56:35.670">this guys running so hey there's the app the app is actually running that's a good thing...on.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:35.670" end="00:56:38.960">...the applications running you can see the clock ticking</p>
      <p begin="00:56:38.960" end="00:56:45.120">on getting data in real-time that's fantasticgoing to let this run for a little bit</p>
      <p begin="00:56:45.120" end="00:56:49.800">...some data and meanwhile I'm going to pop open</p>
      <p begin="00:56:51.430" end="00:57:06.150">...open a website here.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:06.150" end="00:57:11.050">The application part is easy but the typing the right thing into internet explorer thing is much harder</p>
      <p begin="00:57:11.050" end="00:57:14.210">format ok so</p>
      <p begin="00:57:14.210" end="00:57:18.440">when you see here is an open-source project that we've developed at microsoft called</p>
      <p begin="00:57:18.440" end="00:57:23.360">connect the dots I'm using connect the dots is a very easy onramp into the</p>
      <p begin="00:57:23.360" end="00:57:26.510">...your io t infrastructure that sam and his team or</p>
      <p begin="00:57:26.510" end="00:57:31.420">building so this gives me a very easy way to take these properties that you saw me collect on this</p>
      <p begin="00:57:31.420" end="00:57:35.330">device packages them up and do a</p>
      <p begin="00:57:35.330" end="00:57:40.040">...document and...sends that...rest api</p>
      <p begin="00:57:40.040" end="00:57:44.880">...through the through set of libraries that connect the dots offers</p>
      <p begin="00:57:44.880" end="00:57:49.160">...makes it really easy for me to just kind of send this data up so you can see m</p>
      <p begin="00:57:49.160" end="00:57:55.460">collecting data right here as time goes forward it's a little let's see if let's see</p>
      <p begin="00:57:55.460" end="00:58:06.850">if I can perturbed if I can perturbed the data may be by blowing on this thing?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:06.850" end="00:58:12.950">...seattle okay...perturbed I had garlic for lunch and I would be perturbed</p>
      <p begin="00:58:12.950" end="00:58:19.630">toactually you can see...interesting bug here which is at about a...twenty</p>
      <p begin="00:58:19.630" end="00:58:24.950">that humidity flips over back to zero again so that's why you see that weird drop in the</p>
      <p begin="00:58:24.950" end="00:58:30.630">graph so, this data is going from my machine again...rest api calls</p>
      <p begin="00:58:30.630" end="00:58:34.700">...document it goes in through event hub which sam</p>
      <p begin="00:58:34.700" end="00:58:39.040">described to you and then from event hub this gets put industry analytics and</p>
      <p begin="00:58:39.040" end="00:58:44.570">also get put into as your machine learning so using machine learning you see some</p>
      <p begin="00:58:44.570" end="00:58:49.870">little polka dots appearing on this graph if I were to hover over these what this</p>
      <p begin="00:58:49.870" end="00:58:54.210">says is that this...dot is an anomaly in the data detected by</p>
      <p begin="00:58:54.210" end="00:58:59.120">asher machine learning so I started this I let it run for a little bit it learned as it was</p>
      <p begin="00:58:59.120" end="00:59:04.450">collecting data what sort of normal looks like and then as I blew into it I</p>
      <p begin="00:59:04.450" end="00:59:09.160">created some conditions that made it look not normal anymore so that as your machine learning kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:59:09.160" end="00:59:13.050">...that and was able to them report backed me and I, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:13.050" end="00:59:17.960">...not blown into this that will maybe give-me reason to pause and I think this is a common pattern</p>
      <p begin="00:59:17.960" end="00:59:24.760">we're saying with...anomaly...predictive maintenance your machine learning that's right?</p>
      <p begin="00:59:24.760" end="00:59:34.840">Okay, and,...switch back to back to slides.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:34.840" end="00:59:37.220">We talked about all join a little bit earlier</p>
      <p begin="00:59:37.220" end="00:59:42.160">...gavin to the session earlier this is the idea that no matter what kind of device I had no matter</p>
      <p begin="00:59:42.160" end="00:59:52.860">who makes it they should all just be able to work together in a secure way.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:52.860" end="00:59:56.760">And,...and, then one other thing I wanted to mention</p>
      <p begin="00:59:56.760" end="01:00:01.050">...you guys is this idea of complete life-cycle management from the time I</p>
      <p begin="01:00:01.050" end="01:00:05.000">...role device into my enterprises included as a part of my</p>
      <p begin="01:00:05.000" end="01:00:09.980">inventory configure it manage the...software that runs on that device</p>
      <p begin="01:00:09.980" end="01:00:14.910">...assistance...something goes wrong with that device and finally take it out of my</p>
      <p begin="01:00:14.910" end="01:00:20.160">...after a period of time we've got both the support within the operating system</p>
      <p begin="01:00:20.160" end="01:00:25.870">as well as ... our tools with system center and into or</p>
      <p begin="01:00:25.870" end="01:00:30.900">third-party mgm tools this is all happens over open protocol called</p>
      <p begin="01:00:30.900" end="01:00:36.700">...so you can manage all of these devices and very consistent way.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:36.700" end="01:00:38.620">And, to learn more few sessions point you</p>
      <p begin="01:00:38.620" end="01:00:42.750">two-one is pure richardson session on all of the io to devices</p>
      <p begin="01:00:44.290" end="01:00:49.200">all of the windows...additions my session tomorrow which will be more focused on</p>
      <p begin="01:00:49.200" end="01:00:53.510">the maker space retail session I mention which is on friday and you</p>
      <p begin="01:00:53.510" end="01:00:59.390">can catch gavin session on the recording.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:59.390" end="01:01:02.740">All right does great steve so,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:02.740" end="01:01:08.870">my little board went to sleep it's now back up you can come up and take a look at it really</p>
      <p begin="01:01:08.870" end="01:01:13.840">highlights the need to be able to remotely manage these devices</p>
      <p begin="01:01:13.840" end="01:01:16.270">I'm being told I can I can show it.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:18.190" end="01:01:29.640">All right screens.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:29.640" end="01:01:35.320">And, now push my button.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:35.320" end="01:01:39.340">Go back over to.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:39.340" end="01:01:42.530">And,...back-up yet.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:42.530" end="01:01:52.180">...changed on here I can see it moi.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:52.180" end="01:01:55.420">Like this segment...again it appears the drinks have gone</p>
      <p begin="01:01:55.420" end="01:02:02.980">...one dollar...my kind of that's my kind of embed device.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:02.980" end="01:02:08.090">But, this really highlights the need to be able to remotely manage devices because this isn't</p>
      <p begin="01:02:08.090" end="01:02:22.660">something you'd want to go... rolla truck for you'd want to just go send a signal.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:22.660" end="01:02:29.010">...okay we just got this...so.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:29.010" end="01:02:34.140">...ending on...note a thank you all for coming we've got a bunch</p>
      <p begin="01:02:34.140" end="01:02:37.220">of great stuff coming up and I ot that will be disclosing later this</p>
      <p begin="01:02:37.220" end="01:02:43.020">...well we appreciate all your support and...have a great build thank you.</p>
