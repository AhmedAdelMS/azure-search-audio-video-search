      <p begin="00:00:05.140" end="00:00:08.180">Three-d game on xbox a windows you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.180" end="00:00:10.700">that was powered by direct ax.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.700" end="00:00:14.490">So, in a nutshell our goal by adding direct...direct</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.490" end="00:00:19.750">...was to take the our of direct acts and to add high-quality</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.750" end="00:00:24.690">drawing and text capabilities such as what you saw in api such as gi plus</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.690" end="00:00:30.910">and system...drawing so how well did we accomplish cycle well today directed</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.910" end="00:00:35.080">...use everywhere from mozilla firefox to our own browsers</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.080" end="00:00:37.940">...project sorry microsoft edge</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.940" end="00:00:42.630">and even the complete microsoft office suite of productivity apps and,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.630" end="00:00:47.510">furthermore every single application that's written on the universal windows platform</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.510" end="00:00:51.280">html resemble ...powered by directed</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.280" end="00:01:01.410">...so we think we've been very successful in this regard.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.410" end="00:01:04.090">Kleenex we go.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.090" end="00:01:08.880">But, as always we knew there were things that we can improve direct</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:11.200">x was designed to support</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.200" end="00:01:15.790">the most complex and sophisticated applications in the world and similarly the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.790" end="00:01:22.560">api surface is also very complex and frankly it takes a very long-time to master.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:26.400">So, we have many stories on the graphics timor</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:29.860">developers come to us and they say look I get the benefit of direct</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.860" end="00:01:33.800">...it's going to give me the fastest performance and the highest visual</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.800" end="00:01:37.080">fidelity but I'm not trying to build the next halo, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:37.080" end="00:01:41.120">I have like a week to finish this application I really don't have the time to</p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.120" end="00:01:45.240">become a graphics expert and wrap-up on direct...just to get my applications</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.240" end="00:01:51.890">...run and we really didn't have a great story for these developers.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.890" end="00:01:58.980">So, it was with stories like these in mind that we set out to build...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.980" end="00:02:02.500">Wintry is a...drawing library that combines the our of</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.500" end="00:02:05.980">direct acts with the ease of use from dot net level api</p>
      <p begin="00:02:05.980" end="00:02:13.940">as and combine them into one api offering for your windows universal apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.940" end="00:02:14.350">So, as a</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.350" end="00:02:19.160">to drawing library we can do things such as draw text shapes two-d</p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.160" end="00:02:23.980">geometry images and also many more sophisticated things such as</p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.980" end="00:02:31.560">image affects advanced blending opacity masks and things like that when to the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.560" end="00:02:35.480">as part of the universal windows platform and this means that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.480" end="00:02:39.380">it will want any device that is running windows ten in addition</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.380" end="00:02:44.230">we also specifically support windows and windows phone two-point-one.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.230" end="00:02:48.510">You can write your wintry app using cplus-plus csharp or any other clr</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.510" end="00:02:55.070">language and finally you can get...to the today on you get dot org</p>
      <p begin="00:02:55.070" end="00:02:57.550">...targeting a windows eight-point one or windows phone</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.550" end="00:03:04.270">important project you can actually ship your apple in the store successfully today.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:04.270" end="00:03:09.200">Just as a note for windows ten we're waiting for the updated release of the windows</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.200" end="00:03:12.600">tennis decay and latest flooded bits before we release</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.600" end="00:03:17.970">...up-to-date when...version for windows time.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:17.970" end="00:03:21.620">So, I'm going to give you a quick demo of some of the basic functionality that when to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:21.620" end="00:03:34.410">portability provides to give you a better idea of what we're talking about.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.410" end="00:03:38.930">what I'm watching here is an application called the wintry example gallery this is a sample up the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:38.930" end="00:03:43.530">...and it showcases some of the api capabilities you get and also some</p>
      <p begin="00:03:43.530" end="00:03:47.000">...scenarios that you can you can accomplish using</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47.000" end="00:03:51.150">when to the and in fact we actually ship this on the windows and windows phone</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.150" end="00:03:56.130">stores as a proof of concept so if you want you can download and follow along somebody</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.130" end="00:04:03.100">...all of you guys were like starring your laptops and phones actually just using wintry?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.100" end="00:04:05.020">Don't break my heart please?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:05.020" end="00:04:09.090">So, let's...some basic functionality basic shapes such as</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.090" end="00:04:09.640">lines rectangles.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:11.630" end="00:04:16.210">And, circles so here you can see we're doing some very basic styling</p>
      <p begin="00:04:16.210" end="00:04:20.160">we've color each line with the different color but wintry obviously gives you much</p>
      <p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:28.650">more powerful functionality to control the appearance of geometry so let's take a look at a bit of that.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.650" end="00:04:32.560">So, obviously you can control the color and thickness...when</p>
      <p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:36.280">particular for strokes we can change the solve line?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:36.280" end="00:04:40.060">To dashes or dots or combinations of the above</p>
      <p begin="00:04:40.060" end="00:04:48.420">...can also control the appearance of each daschle dot.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:48.420" end="00:04:51.090">Wintry also supports geometry two-d</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.090" end="00:04:56.130">geometry basically arbitrary complexity so, what you see here I've drawn a bunch of shapes</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.130" end="00:04:59.550">score circle triangle and the star and,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.550" end="00:05:04.100">I've defined...by combining ten different line segments and just for clarity sake I've told</p>
      <p begin="00:05:04.100" end="00:05:08.000">when to the to outlined each shape in some read?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:12.620">An important thing here is that if I tell...combine these into a single shape object</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12.620" end="00:05:17.580">a single geometry is not just pasting each shape on top of one another and calling it a</p>
      <p begin="00:05:17.580" end="00:05:22.430">it's actually we calculating the mathematical vector definitions so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.430" end="00:05:25.010">if I told only draw the outline.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:25.010" end="00:05:26.300">You can see that we</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.300" end="00:05:34.800">are not including the lines where the star intersects with the other shapes.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.800" end="00:05:38.410">Next we have text so text fundamental is just a</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.410" end="00:05:42.760">...form of geometry so you can see here that we've stylized it using</p>
      <p begin="00:05:42.760" end="00:05:46.140">a geometry option we have a gradient that goes some read all the way to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:46.140" end="00:05:50.110">green down at the bottom but because of this text we have a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:50.110" end="00:05:52.640">...functionality as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52.640" end="00:05:53.170">For example,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.170" end="00:05:57.790">here I've told when to the to draw the layout bounds of every single character that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:57.790" end="00:06:03.540">basically is the positioning and spacing of every character and we can use</p>
      <p begin="00:06:03.540" end="00:06:12.490">this implement functionality such as hit testing or dragged to select as you can see here.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:12.490" end="00:06:15.080">Wintry is fully unicode compliant and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.080" end="00:06:19.110">you can properly display your bidirectional or top-down text as you can see here with this</p>
      <p begin="00:06:19.110" end="00:06:29.950">chinese script and once again because it is text you get layout options.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:29.950" end="00:06:34.520">And, finally we have...system demo so this is something that's a little more end-to-end</p>
      <p begin="00:06:34.520" end="00:06:38.240">we're drawing something looks a little fancy on the screen.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:41.240">Fundamentally what we're doing here we're just loading a bitmap of a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.240" end="00:06:45.900">small particle and fine particle and we're creating many instances of that bitmap and then</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.900" end="00:06:58.960">were blending them together and animated them across the screen.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:02.200">Okay, so, what kind of scenarios do we think that?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:02.200" end="00:07:05.330">Do we think role really benefit from...to the of course when to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.330" end="00:07:11.940">...as a general-purpose drawing api so we really think the skies of limit?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:11.940" end="00:07:13.810">First we have data visualization</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.810" end="00:07:18.770">on this is if you have tens of thousands of data points you want to render them on-screen or maybe you</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.770" end="00:07:24.140">have an architectural diagram or some kind of sophisticated technical drawing.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.140" end="00:07:25.580">Second are creative apps this</p>
      <p begin="00:07:25.580" end="00:07:29.900">can include a photo editor app maybe a drawing application or to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:29.900" end="00:07:33.990">your casual game you want sophisticated visuals but you don't necessarily need</p>
      <p begin="00:07:33.990" end="00:07:40.230">the full our of a three engine and finally we have custom controls so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:40.230" end="00:07:42.470">if you're trying to extend example toolkit now</p>
      <p begin="00:07:42.470" end="00:07:47.270">...obviously has very powerful built-in and custom control functionality but later in this</p>
      <p begin="00:07:47.270" end="00:07:55.290">talk you'll see some errors where you may want to go beyond its capabilities and use when today.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:55.290" end="00:07:59.810">Ok, so, by now you should have a decent idea of what...can do.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:59.810" end="00:08:03.050">What you care and this is an important question because as, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:03.050" end="00:08:06.850">there are many excellent graphics api solutions out there both</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.850" end="00:08:14.450">made my microsoft and by third parties so what makes...to be special?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:14.450" end="00:08:18.210">If you can remember one slide from this presentation let this be</p>
      <p begin="00:08:18.210" end="00:08:24.600">...reasons why we think that wintry is an excellent tool you should consider.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:24.600" end="00:08:29.710">It is super easy-to-use just like all the dot net level api...that, you know, and,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:29.710" end="00:08:35.830">It offers extremely fast performance and it scales the complexity of your visuals.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:35.830" end="00:08:39.830">It as powerful comprehensive to drawing capabilities and it has</p>
      <p begin="00:08:39.830" end="00:08:45.010">some really unique are graphical tricks that we...you can use to make your windows up</p>
      <p begin="00:08:45.010" end="00:08:50.030">really shine on the store and finally by being open-source we can</p>
      <p begin="00:08:50.030" end="00:08:58.090">provide you our developer community with a high-level transparency and flexibility.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:58.090" end="00:09:00.540">So, let's look at ease of use.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:00.540" end="00:09:04.690">We design went to the two-btwo encourage your creativity and to</p>
      <p begin="00:09:04.690" end="00:09:08.640">let-you explore...experiment as you're building...graphics</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.640" end="00:09:13.480">what this means is you should be able to come up with some kind of really core visual idea in your mind</p>
      <p begin="00:09:13.480" end="00:09:17.620">implement in your code and then iteratively...tweak</p>
      <p begin="00:09:17.620" end="00:09:25.230">and modified things as you come up with new ideas and...do that with minimal friction and frustration.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:25.230" end="00:09:29.970">So, instead of just talking to some slides I think you guys are probably rather see some live coding and,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:29.970" end="00:09:35.150">because I enjoy tempting the demo god's I will applies in the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:35.150" end="00:09:39.450">grand tradition of if you are introductions we're going to build the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:39.450" end="00:09:44.300">...world out using...and I'm going to show you how easy it is to use into the get started to build</p>
      <p begin="00:09:44.300" end="00:09:49.710">...basic graphics and to quickly build-up from there and do some more sophisticated things</p>
      <p begin="00:09:49.710" end="00:09:54.670">so what we have here is a blank csharp universal app universal windows</p>
      <p begin="00:09:54.670" end="00:09:59.380">up project...of time about a couple small things first?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:59.380" end="00:10:04.390">So, for example, you can see that about a couple namespaces I have a few</p>
      <p begin="00:10:04.390" end="00:10:08.740">random number helpers and these will use later in the talk.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:08.740" end="00:10:13.200">And, finally have this cute photo of some penguins.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:16.900">So, the first thing that you need to know...when you're using...the is that we don't</p>
      <p begin="00:10:16.900" end="00:10:22.060">...in-box with the windows tennis decay...as a new get package and if you've ever use</p>
      <p begin="00:10:22.060" end="00:10:26.710">...get packages before, you know, that adding them to your project is very simple.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:26.710" end="00:10:30.000">Let's go ahead and write click the project greasing</p>
      <p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:34.490">...get packages now for the purposes of this demo I've already installed</p>
      <p begin="00:10:34.490" end="00:10:36.520">wintry which you can see hear from a local</p>
      <p begin="00:10:36.520" end="00:10:40.940">package source but normally you would go to new get dot org to</p>
      <p begin="00:10:40.940" end="00:10:44.740">download it and you can see and are references...</p>
      <p begin="00:10:44.740" end="00:10:52.880">microsoft graphics dot canvas and that's the name space for all of the wintry functionality lives?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:57.100">So, now we have to get we need some place to draw the content so I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:10:57.100" end="00:11:02.270">...and, went to the sorry now that...to...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:02.270" end="00:11:10.320">Before out-of-control we're just going to telecast tells me what namespaces...looking and.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:16.040">So, graphics dot canvas dot ui downsample.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:16.040" end="00:11:22.820">Now that we have that out of the way let's go ahead and add a canvas control.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:22.820" end="00:11:29.370">So, canvas control is where you...your canvas were usual your content obviously.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:29.370" end="00:11:34.080">Chemists control provides us with an event called...we'll call this</p>
      <p begin="00:11:34.080" end="00:11:38.910">...will raises event whenever...application needs to reach...content...this includes things</p>
      <p begin="00:11:38.910" end="00:11:43.780">...window or maybe the users manipulated some content on the screen</p>
      <p begin="00:11:43.780" end="00:11:47.110">...auto insert handler.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:47.110" end="00:11:48.170">Close that out.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:49.770" end="00:11:57.460">So, we go to our code behind you can see its added the signature for themethod for the event...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:57.460" end="00:12:01.580">Surpasses us...arguments the first one is just the canvas control that</p>
      <p begin="00:12:01.580" end="00:12:08.500">...the event and the second argument is this canvas...arcs.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:08.500" end="00:12:10.180">So, we take chemist...arcs.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:11.280" end="00:12:16.210">Has this number called drawing session and this-is of type canvas drawing session</p>
      <p begin="00:12:16.210" end="00:12:19.760">chemist drawing session class is where most of the basic</p>
      <p begin="00:12:19.760" end="00:12:24.660">rendering functionality that you need is located this includes methods like draw a line or</p>
      <p begin="00:12:24.660" end="00:12:26.520">draw image on our case?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:27.810" end="00:12:30.000">...draw text.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:33.350">So, we passing here well obviously we need.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:33.350" end="00:12:35.450">...famous...world.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:35.450" end="00:12:38.800">It's asking for position I don't want to put in a vector</p>
      <p begin="00:12:38.800" end="00:12:43.320">...I'm just going to put in to...so this tells us where we want to draw the text</p>
      <p begin="00:12:43.320" end="00:12:51.270">a and finally we need to give it a color so I'm going to give it a predefined color.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:51.270" end="00:12:56.190">there we go and I feel like every time I press compile and stage I have to like sacrifice...go to</p>
      <p begin="00:12:56.190" end="00:13:01.280">the...something so let's keep our fingers crossed it is turning away.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:02.320" end="00:13:07.540">Registering applications we know.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:07.540" end="00:13:11.950">Wow, that's along loading ok dario hello world so the important thing here is that</p>
      <p begin="00:13:11.950" end="00:13:16.740">apart from that boiler plate that we added we have one-line of csharp and one-line</p>
      <p begin="00:13:16.740" end="00:13:21.310">...and can't really get much simpler than that windy makes this kind of simple</p>
      <p begin="00:13:21.310" end="00:13:25.700">startup possible because we handle much of the background functionality and</p>
      <p begin="00:13:25.700" end="00:13:27.660">startup code that you normally need to</p>
      <p begin="00:13:27.660" end="00:13:32.430">write so when I say the point I'm really talking about to those of you who've use direct tax in</p>
      <p begin="00:13:32.430" end="00:13:37.130">...direct x has this philosophy where you are as the developer</p>
      <p begin="00:13:37.130" end="00:13:42.020">and total control over the behavior of the api and the graphics hardware</p>
      <p begin="00:13:42.020" end="00:13:46.900">but on the flipside this means you literally have to write hundreds and hundreds of lines of code to specify the exact</p>
      <p begin="00:13:46.900" end="00:13:51.290">behave you want just to get to say the first triangle drawn on the screen?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:51.290" end="00:13:53.820">So, into this case we know all about these best</p>
      <p begin="00:13:53.820" end="00:13:58.800">practices we also know that in most common use cases you guys are using the exact same</p>
      <p begin="00:13:58.800" end="00:14:04.240">kong pattern again and again so we really can just do that for you.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:07.440">Ok, so, teller role is interesting all that I think you guys have seen that many</p>
      <p begin="00:14:07.440" end="00:14:11.940">times I personally think just plain black-and-white taxes a little bit boring so,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.940" end="00:14:15.100">let's change things up a little bit let's do.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:16.180" end="00:14:24.460">...bunch of...that's...for...zero I remember my for loops.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:24.460" end="00:14:28.150">So, we'll do two hundred operations of this.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:28.150" end="00:14:34.840">I also remote parentheses.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:34.840" end="00:14:38.540">So, we're trying to hundred lines let's give it a random positions we're going to use some of those</p>
      <p begin="00:14:38.540" end="00:14:43.470">hoppers I did random axiom random...give us to.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:43.470" end="00:14:45.180">Random floats.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:45.180" end="00:14:48.270">...instead of having a pre specified color we're going</p>
      <p begin="00:14:48.270" end="00:14:51.040">to use the from a rgb.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:52.630" end="00:14:57.420">Color dot from a rgb helper this let's define a...using</p>
      <p begin="00:14:57.420" end="00:15:01.210">the alpha red-green-blue values from zero to two-fifty five.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:01.210" end="00:15:03.520">Alphas can be fully opaque but for the other three</p>
      <p begin="00:15:03.520" end="00:15:13.000">color the channels we're going to use just a random number.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:13.000" end="00:15:18.030">Okay, one more go in the sacrificial...</p>
      <p begin="00:15:18.030" end="00:15:21.480">The real ok so that's a little more interesting right we have a bunch of</p>
      <p begin="00:15:21.480" end="00:15:24.870">...world sale look a little different once again with the for loop</p>
      <p begin="00:15:24.870" end="00:15:30.190">two lines of csharp one-line example so as I was modifying the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:30.190" end="00:15:34.040">draw text method you might have been wondering what a second like all you're doing is changing the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:34.040" end="00:15:38.480">...color like can I do like size or font like layout like other</p>
      <p begin="00:15:38.480" end="00:15:43.260">advance things the...yes of course we let-you control all of that so</p>
      <p begin="00:15:43.260" end="00:15:47.560">...activate intelligence here you can see we have a lot of over loads for</p>
      <p begin="00:15:47.560" end="00:15:50.110">draw text maybe a little hard to see on the screen but,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:50.110" end="00:15:52.620">for example, this one is more advance...it provides</p>
      <p begin="00:15:52.620" end="00:15:57.240">this last class that you passing called canvas text format in particular that's what you</p>
      <p begin="00:15:57.240" end="00:16:01.950">user control font family font weight things like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:01.950" end="00:16:06.540">However, my case I'm just doing whole world I don't really care about fought I just wanted some reasonable</p>
      <p begin="00:16:06.540" end="00:16:10.680">defaults I didn't have...the parameters and...one-two does from...is</p>
      <p begin="00:16:10.680" end="00:16:15.230">...gives me these choices of api...give-me just the right level control</p>
      <p begin="00:16:15.230" end="00:16:20.140">from my scenario so for simple cases like this one the code</p>
      <p begin="00:16:20.140" end="00:16:24.980">should be very simple as I make things more sophisticated in my in my app the api should</p>
      <p begin="00:16:24.980" end="00:16:28.120">scale and complexity as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:28.120" end="00:16:36.150">All right so I personally like it when things move around on the screen let's you some animation.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:36.150" end="00:16:36.920">...back into</p>
      <p begin="00:16:36.920" end="00:16:41.700">...example I'm going to replace the canvas...</p>
      <p begin="00:16:42.950" end="00:16:45.870">...animated control.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:45.870" end="00:16:50.070">So, canvas control is designed for mostly static content so this</p>
      <p begin="00:16:50.070" end="00:16:53.910">is typical mainstream app where you don't want to redraw unless something is happy to</p>
      <p begin="00:16:53.910" end="00:16:57.250">invalidate dot content so that's what we did previously.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:57.250" end="00:17:02.230">Chemists animated control on the other hand...designed for continually changing content so this might be like a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:02.230" end="00:17:06.300">to...game or some kind of animation and you want to control to</p>
      <p begin="00:17:06.300" end="00:17:10.330">razed draw event on a regular interval.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:10.330" end="00:17:12.780">So, under the covers canvas animated control</p>
      <p begin="00:17:12.780" end="00:17:17.070">action behaves very differently from canvas control if you use direct...to do this, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:17.070" end="00:17:21.800">that you running on a background thread you have different integration points sample if the change where your</p>
      <p begin="00:17:21.800" end="00:17:25.690">message...works once again because we're wintry we do all this</p>
      <p begin="00:17:25.690" end="00:17:28.800">for you and we can give the developer a very</p>
      <p begin="00:17:28.800" end="00:17:33.220">consistent experience between these different modes of operation so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:33.220" end="00:17:34.360">canvas...control.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:35.390" end="00:17:36.430">Has a draw that?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:37.830" end="00:17:44.620">And, we'll see it looks basically identical to the normal canvas control draw events.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:44.620" end="00:17:48.640">By default we get drawn sixty times per second that's</p>
      <p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:51.950">every sixteen milliseconds so I don't even need to specify</p>
      <p begin="00:17:51.950" end="00:17:58.230">that what I can literally do I can take my existing...code cut it out.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:58.230" end="00:18:03.010">Plopped in you canvas animated control event handler just delete that.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:03.010" end="00:18:10.460">Let's see what we have.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.460" end="00:18:15.010">All right so sixty frames a second we have a lot of drawn animated texoma</p>
      <p begin="00:18:15.010" end="00:18:16.570">...course my one</p>
      <p begin="00:18:16.570" end="00:18:26.170">...kind of looks really weird but two lines of code one-line of markup.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:26.170" end="00:18:31.110">I'm going to one more thing so one of the more advanced functionality that you get from wins tr image</p>
      <p begin="00:18:31.110" end="00:18:36.410">processes of brushes basically something that can paints the interior of</p>
      <p begin="00:18:36.410" end="00:18:39.010">a geometry region so,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:39.010" end="00:18:43.510">for example, when I specify the solid the...in the in this example right now</p>
      <p begin="00:18:43.510" end="00:18:48.790">it's actually creating a solid color brush underneath the covers...image brush</p>
      <p begin="00:18:48.790" end="00:18:55.010">...is just a brush that where you get the content from image that you look from disk?</p>
      <p begin="00:18:55.010" end="00:18:57.760">So, the interest of time I'm going to cheat a little now I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:18:57.760" end="00:19:06.180">to take some free written code first we have a couple of namespaces.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:06.180" end="00:19:07.250">We're going to.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:08.340" end="00:19:10.990">Add a new events.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:10.990" end="00:19:11.770">...resources.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:12.940" end="00:19:15.930">So, qui resources where we recommend you create your went to the</p>
      <p begin="00:19:15.930" end="00:19:21.260">resources if you notice now we're calling draw sixty times a second so probably doesn't make sense for</p>
      <p begin="00:19:21.260" end="00:19:24.300">you to like...the disk and loaded image and create an image</p>
      <p begin="00:19:24.300" end="00:19:30.370">rushed every frame instead create resources is the place to do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:30.370" end="00:19:35.000">And, finally I'm going to...in the prebuilt handler for create resources.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:36.110" end="00:19:38.430">So, what we're doing here?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:38.430" end="00:19:42.330">Canvas image animal control...resources.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:42.330" end="00:19:45.540">But, this one is doing as, you know, loading it resources from</p>
      <p begin="00:19:45.540" end="00:19:49.330">...an asynchronous operation so we're telling wintry when</p>
      <p begin="00:19:49.330" end="00:19:55.510">we are dawn where we are completed loading any asynchronous resources.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:55.510" end="00:19:57.730">And, we call a method that we've defined</p>
      <p begin="00:19:57.730" end="00:20:02.650">load resources asic it's right here and we're just doing two things here.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:02.650" end="00:20:08.740">First were loading the image from disk for creating this thing called the canvas bitmap a number creating</p>
      <p begin="00:20:08.740" end="00:20:13.190">are chemists image brush from that image so now they have the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:13.190" end="00:20:20.560">resources loaded let's changer actual draw code.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:20.560" end="00:20:23.770">So,...a solid color find.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:23.770" end="00:20:26.210">...can put in the image brush.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:26.210" end="00:20:29.900">Because this is a more sophisticated scenario wintry asks us to put</p>
      <p begin="00:20:29.900" end="00:20:34.410">a canvas text format class once again I don't really care.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:34.410" end="00:20:45.850">So, we're just going to talk...one.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:45.850" end="00:20:49.600">All right so that's not too bad what we see here every time we call draw</p>
      <p begin="00:20:49.600" end="00:20:54.440">...you can imagine it acting like a stencil where the penguin image can</p>
      <p begin="00:20:54.440" end="00:20:56.670">pick out from behind and we're doing this</p>
      <p begin="00:20:56.670" end="00:21:02.600">to hundred times per frame sixty frames per second.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:02.600" end="00:21:05.390">And, as before just a few lines of csharp</p>
      <p begin="00:21:05.390" end="00:21:18.470">code one-line example we're able to build this a very quickly and with minimal...</p>
      <p begin="00:21:18.470" end="00:21:21.370">So, what we saw here wintry let-you</p>
      <p begin="00:21:21.370" end="00:21:26.310">right much less code to get your drawing the interesting part because we handle a lot of the heavy lifting</p>
      <p begin="00:21:26.310" end="00:21:31.000">for you and also we give you simple api choices for when you only</p>
      <p begin="00:21:31.000" end="00:21:35.630">want simple functionality and we scale along with the needs of the developer when you want</p>
      <p begin="00:21:35.630" end="00:21:40.290">to more advanced things?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:40.290" end="00:21:43.500">So, next...performance so what is easy-to-use what happens if</p>
      <p begin="00:21:43.500" end="00:21:46.580">it's not fast enough to keep up with my needs spoiler.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:47.950" end="00:21:50.870">We are very fast.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:50.870" end="00:21:54.850">So, them through that by showing you.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:54.850" end="00:21:57.510">Oops sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:57.510" end="00:22:01.230">...show you a modified version of our whole world</p>

      <p begin="00:26:15.870" end="00:26:20.680">on the other hand we give you easy-to-use treaty rendering and very little else,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:20.680" end="00:26:23.720">for example, we don't give any of those services that I just</p>
      <p begin="00:26:23.720" end="00:26:28.720">mentioned and this lets us focus all of our energy on being a very</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.720" end="00:26:40.710">...very low overhead layer on top of direct today?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:40.710" end="00:26:43.130">So, we've shown that it's fast and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:43.130" end="00:26:48.390">...is easy-to-use and it scales with your demanding performance requirements but,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:48.390" end="00:26:51.770">I've only...like text and lines and some basic shapes</p>
      <p begin="00:26:51.770" end="00:27:00.360">...does it need all the needs...you have from more sophisticated rendering.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:00.360" end="00:27:03.900">So, just like how I said being built on directed indirect</p>
      <p begin="00:27:03.900" end="00:27:07.990">...gives us very good performance it gives us</p>
      <p begin="00:27:07.990" end="00:27:10.230">a very comprehensive drawing capabilities as</p>
      <p begin="00:27:10.230" end="00:27:15.090">well as I mentioned earlier how everything on windows and,</p>

      <p begin="00:27:34.030" end="00:27:38.510">...almost everything you can do indirectly indirect right in</p>
      <p begin="00:27:38.510" end="00:27:42.060">...today.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42.060" end="00:27:46.990">I want to talk now about three specific areas in when to the that we think are particularly</p>
      <p begin="00:27:46.990" end="00:27:53.070">core and we think that you can use a differentiate your apps on the windows store.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:53.070" end="00:27:54.330">The first is image...</p>
      <p begin="00:27:55.370" end="00:27:58.920">If you're not familiar with these image effects also known as filter</p>
      <p begin="00:27:58.920" end="00:28:02.050">facts and there are graphical transformation that you</p>
      <p begin="00:28:02.050" end="00:28:05.950">...pixel data so here I have three common examples of</p>
      <p begin="00:28:05.950" end="00:28:14.850">discrete transfer morphology and gaussian blur.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:14.850" end="00:28:17.610">So, when...provides a...of over thirty built-in</p>
      <p begin="00:28:17.610" end="00:28:21.550">effects the real our you get with the facts are that you can</p>
      <p begin="00:28:21.550" end="00:28:29.160">combine them together into changing graphs and animate them and realtime?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:29.160" end="00:28:31.010">Let's take a look.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:31.010" end="00:28:33.540">At some effects.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:33.540" end="00:28:37.050">So, go back to the example gallery.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:37.050" end="00:28:37.830">So, here, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:37.830" end="00:28:42.710">...something basic gaussian blur we're just changing the blur radius over time.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:42.710" end="00:28:46.000">Saturation.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:46.000" end="00:28:48.960">Blend is a little more complex it takes to inputs we have all of the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:48.960" end="00:28:55.440">standard ported off of one...composite mods arithmetic composite.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:55.440" end="00:29:03.160">Morphology as we saw before this lets...or thin novel...in your image.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:03.160" end="00:29:05.510">We have some more sophisticated things here's lighting</p>
      <p begin="00:29:05.510" end="00:29:09.610">...actually we're doing is we're using the image of</p>
      <p begin="00:29:09.610" end="00:29:12.890">our intrepid mascot cinnamon and we're extracting.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:14.150" end="00:29:19.890">...basic creating height map based on the luminous...using that to white.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:19.890" end="00:29:24.590">We have something like displacement map displace map and also the lighting effects that you saw</p>
      <p begin="00:29:24.590" end="00:29:29.370">that previous demo are these are actually combinations of multiple effects that we use together</p>
      <p begin="00:29:29.370" end="00:29:33.270">...specifically...for displacement map we're using a transform to the effect</p>
      <p begin="00:29:33.270" end="00:29:37.980">...turbulence effect and displacement map effects.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:37.980" end="00:29:43.290">So, what exactly does that mean when I say we combine multiple effects together?</p>
      <p begin="00:29:43.290" end="00:29:48.270">Effects take inputs and the key thing is that the input to an effect can be an image</p>
      <p begin="00:29:48.270" end="00:29:53.110">such as the source image but also can be another effect such as you see with turbulence which feeds into</p>
      <p begin="00:29:53.110" end="00:29:58.210">to transform which feeds and displacement map so in this case we start with</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.210" end="00:30:03.330">turbulence and turbulence generates...and noise and that's basically pseudo random noise that</p>
      <p begin="00:30:03.330" end="00:30:07.510">has this kind of smooth appearance and you see this often in like video games and special effects</p>
      <p begin="00:30:07.510" end="00:30:11.410">in movies...map affect takes the bitmap</p>
      <p begin="00:30:11.410" end="00:30:17.450">...that turbulence field and...it to warp the image and you can see in the output we</p>
      <p begin="00:30:17.450" end="00:30:20.180">have the animation by sticking this</p>
      <p begin="00:30:20.180" end="00:30:25.040">...transfer...between turbulence and displacement map and you can imagine that</p>
      <p begin="00:30:25.040" end="00:30:30.040">it's like if I have this ripple pane of glass and from my face so that's the turbulence noise</p>
      <p begin="00:30:30.040" end="00:30:34.480">...viewing the distorted seen...and I kinda just like wrote move the pane of glass</p>
      <p begin="00:30:34.480" end="00:30:40.550">around like this right you can imagine the world in front of you also ripple over time so the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:40.550" end="00:30:45.150">specifics of the scenario aren't that important the and the key take away is that these</p>
      <p begin="00:30:45.150" end="00:30:48.820">effects are powerful on their own but you can combine them together and</p>
      <p begin="00:30:48.820" end="00:30:55.700">...animator properties in real-time to get some really clever visual tricks.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:55.700" end="00:30:57.010">One thing I want to emphasize the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:57.010" end="00:31:01.730">...is that you commonly called...image effects but they can be apply to any</p>
      <p begin="00:31:01.730" end="00:31:11.770">...the content geometry text images or...all the same.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:11.770" end="00:31:15.050">So, we now go to the burning text demo this is something you might have seen if you've attended</p>
      <p begin="00:31:15.050" end="00:31:17.250">a direct to talk in recent years</p>
      <p begin="00:31:17.250" end="00:31:23.150">...can't we...it over this demo this is applying no less than ten</p>
      <p begin="00:31:23.150" end="00:31:26.720">...to give this kind of shivering flame the important thing here is</p>
      <p begin="00:31:26.720" end="00:31:36.390">that this is just tax and we're doing this dynamically in real-time so we can replace this.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:36.390" end="00:31:41.220">For reference to implement this it took about two hundred fifty lines of csharp</p>
      <p begin="00:31:41.220" end="00:31:42.970">...code to do this</p>
      <p begin="00:31:42.970" end="00:31:49.440">and native directory a take something like over sixteen hundred lines cplus-plus.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:49.440" end="00:31:53.770">No, this is not endorsement to apply burning text all your text unless perhaps</p>
      <p begin="00:31:53.770" end="00:31:57.680">actually doing like late nineties heavy metal band up or something</p>

      <p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:15.790">most important thing is that you can leverage your existing direct acts or when to decode</p>
      <p begin="00:33:15.790" end="00:33:22.850">base mixing usage of the other api and you don't need to throw out your existing code?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:22.850" end="00:33:33.210">So, let's show you with a concrete example.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:33.210" end="00:33:35.420">So, we have here...kind of standard</p>
      <p begin="00:33:35.420" end="00:33:39.390">three-d demo of three-d spinning teapot and this is being rendered in direct</p>
      <p begin="00:33:39.390" end="00:33:43.510">...using the excellent direct...toolkit to hubble's</p>
      <p begin="00:33:43.510" end="00:33:48.530">...these things and,...we're doing here one thing that direct three-d doesn't have</p>
      <p begin="00:33:48.530" end="00:33:51.330">...functionality for is rich text</p>
      <p begin="00:33:51.330" end="00:33:55.910">rendering so entail is seeing a layout fonts things like that and</p>
      <p begin="00:33:55.910" end="00:34:00.460">...is we use wintry we've just...some text...elevating up</p>
      <p begin="00:34:00.460" end="00:34:05.470">overtime and we use that as a texture in direct three-d with every frame so</p>
      <p begin="00:34:05.470" end="00:34:10.380">...just mapping it on to the teapot then what we're doing we take the render</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.380" end="00:34:15.510">target indirect three-day we bring that back into the and we're using</p>
      <p begin="00:34:15.510" end="00:34:20.470">...apply this bloom post-processing effect so bump up the intensity right here?</p>
      <p begin="00:34:20.470" end="00:34:23.929">What hi?</p>
      <p begin="00:34:23.929" end="00:34:25.619">As we see here.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:25.619" end="00:34:29.249">We go from one today...want to go a little further maybe at some</p>
      <p begin="00:34:29.249" end="00:34:33.449">three-d functionality we're going to directory no loss of code.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:33.449" end="00:34:35.769">Or we can start with direct three-d.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:35.769" end="00:34:38.519">If...to take advantage of something that is easy, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:38.519" end="00:34:57.330">affects and, went to the we can also go that way and no loss of code.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:57.330" end="00:35:02.280">Ok, last up for powerful functionality we have integration with video and composition windows</p>
      <p begin="00:35:02.280" end="00:35:04.350">...api is.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:04.350" end="00:35:09.040">Video and composition our to errors that are closely related with...graphics so we</p>
      <p begin="00:35:09.040" end="00:35:14.910">know that you guys will probably want to use these capabilities together.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:14.910" end="00:35:17.450">Even though we into the is not part of the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:17.450" end="00:35:22.260">inbox windows sdk we ship as you get package we've worked closely with</p>
      <p begin="00:35:22.260" end="00:35:27.160">the corresponding platform teams to make sure that you can seamlessly user</p>
      <p begin="00:35:27.160" end="00:35:30.090">...content with video and composition scenarios?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:31.160" end="00:35:35.790">So,...the first api is the new visual layer api which is part of the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:35.790" end="00:35:40.740">windows dot ui dot composition name space this api is an early preview state for</p>
      <p begin="00:35:40.740" end="00:35:46.920">build but, it's basically a lightweight way for you to add animations</p>
      <p begin="00:35:46.920" end="00:35:51.230">and effects manipulations to ui.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:51.230" end="00:35:56.370">One of the most important things that ads is this thing called independent animations if you've ever in html resemble</p>
      <p begin="00:35:56.370" end="00:35:59.860">...before you might have use independent animations these are basically</p>
      <p begin="00:35:59.860" end="00:36:04.020">a way to guarantee that even if you're app even if absent main thread the</p>
      <p begin="00:36:04.020" end="00:36:09.600">...thread is busydoing calculations or rendering graphics...the animations</p>
      <p begin="00:36:09.600" end="00:36:14.280">will continue to be smoothing glitch free and the user any user interactions</p>
      <p begin="00:36:14.280" end="00:36:20.620">salon in your apple still...response to user interactions like stick your finger touch.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:20.620" end="00:36:24.860">We design went to the so that you can take any wintry content and users input into</p>
      <p begin="00:36:24.860" end="00:36:29.490">the visual layer and this means you get the best of both worlds when titties immediate mode</p>
      <p begin="00:36:29.490" end="00:36:35.720">treaty rendering and the composition api...retain mode functionality.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:35.720" end="00:36:40.470">The second api want to talk about is I basic video...in the windows media</p>
      <p begin="00:36:40.470" end="00:36:42.300">...name space.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:42.300" end="00:36:43.160">I basic video</p>
      <p begin="00:36:43.160" end="00:36:49.380">...is a new is a completely new paradigm for processing video and windows</p>
      <p begin="00:36:49.380" end="00:36:53.480">You implement and I basic video fact interface and you can use</p>
      <p begin="00:36:53.480" end="00:36:58.900">that affect to transform any video on the system that includes downloaded videos</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.900" end="00:37:03.780">on-disk the user streaming from the web or even videos your capturing live</p>
      <p begin="00:37:03.780" end="00:37:07.530">...from a video camera as before we design</p>
      <p begin="00:37:07.530" end="00:37:12.000">...so that I can take captured video frame.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:13.660">Process it however I like using</p>
      <p begin="00:37:13.660" end="00:37:25.730">...and put that back in the media pipeline so let me show you what I'm talking about.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:25.730" end="00:37:28.500">That's a little, little washed out but you can see me right this is</p>
      <p begin="00:37:28.500" end="00:37:31.560">just a standard webcam app you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:31.560" end="00:37:36.120">it's taking live capture video and rendering onto the screen.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:36.120" end="00:37:44.440">But, let's take...to the content and put it on here let's take that displacement map that we looked at earlier.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:44.440" end="00:37:46.830">And,...right.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:46.830" end="00:37:49.950">We can do whatever kind of crazy things we want using</p>
      <p begin="00:37:49.950" end="00:37:54.060">realtime video and while I look really ugly...stop that.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:54.060" end="00:37:57.650">Not very photogenic apparently we think this is a great example</p>
      <p begin="00:37:57.650" end="00:38:02.230">of combining to complimentary api...when to...and video</p>
      <p begin="00:38:02.230" end="00:38:07.520">...and using them to just open up like crazy new scenarios that really</p>
      <p begin="00:38:07.520" end="00:38:11.970">want possible before so one more, for example.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:11.970" end="00:38:14.300">Here I've taken my video...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:14.300" end="00:38:15.540">Chop it up into...little square</p>
      <p begin="00:38:15.540" end="00:38:22.220">tiles and every frame I'm rotating and scaling these tiles right.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:22.220" end="00:38:26.030">Okay, I'm getting a little dizzy...that.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:26.030" end="00:38:29.340">So, how hard was that to do?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:29.340" end="00:38:31.120">The rotated tiles...that last</p>
      <p begin="00:38:31.120" end="00:38:35.400">one you saw including the namespaces and all the boiler plate for the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:35.400" end="00:38:41.180">high basic video affect implementation just under one hundred lines of csharp code</p>
      <p begin="00:38:42.360" end="00:38:45.740">in comparison if you were to use direct to native direct to the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:45.740" end="00:38:50.600">cplus-plus and media foundation so that's the native component that analyzed the media api</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50.600" end="00:38:55.690">...just...do something simple like a gray-scale...over two thousand lines</p>
      <p begin="00:38:55.690" end="00:39:00.120">cplus-plus code one hundred lines versus two thousand now that's</p>
      <p begin="00:39:00.120" end="00:39:12.100">a powerful capabilities that using these windows ten api as can give to you.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:12.100" end="00:39:17.100">...unless we have open-source so open-source is not exactly new thing I microsoft and you</p>
      <p begin="00:39:17.100" end="00:39:22.280">can see over time we have release more things on...licenses we have a dot net</p>
      <p begin="00:39:22.280" end="00:39:27.160">foundation when js and when two-d?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.160" end="00:39:31.030">Was we first announce it in the first announced in september of</p>
      <p begin="00:39:31.030" end="00:39:36.360">two thousand fourteen and restarted shipping are first you get packages a couple months later and we're proud that</p>

      <p begin="00:39:45.240" end="00:39:46.370">So, we think that making</p>
      <p begin="00:39:46.370" end="00:39:51.220">wintry open-source gives you guys to key benefits the first one is that we can</p>
      <p begin="00:39:51.220" end="00:39:56.040">be highly flexible and responsive to-you in fact we push</p>
      <p begin="00:39:56.040" end="00:40:02.590">...new get package...and push new...get hub every single two weeks.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:02.590" end="00:40:04.730">Second we can be highly transparent.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:05.860" end="00:40:10.790">As I said you can browse every single line of source code on get hub are you can build</p>
      <p begin="00:40:10.790" end="00:40:15.570">everything from wintry itself to the documentation to the example gallery</p>
      <p begin="00:40:15.570" end="00:40:20.550">sample...because our tool...one hundred-percent public tooling...</p>

      <p begin="00:40:29.620" end="00:40:34.530">So, what when today we want to engage strongly with our developer community what is to be a</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.530" end="00:40:39.250">two-way conversation why...send comments</p>
      <p begin="00:40:39.250" end="00:40:43.820">our blog if you have any questions or you found blogs and problems we want</p>

      <p begin="00:40:46.970" end="00:40:50.770">bug fixes or chained or your new things you want to add to into the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.770" end="00:40:56.630">...submit apache we have a contributor agreement very quick...and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:56.630" end="00:41:01.170">we want to know what you guys think...what you like tells what's hard</p>
      <p begin="00:41:01.170" end="00:41:05.390">...what kind of scenarios you want to be able to into the we build this api</p>
      <p begin="00:41:05.390" end="00:41:12.480">for you and it really depends on what you guys think about it?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:12.480" end="00:41:14.950">Okay, so, what's next for into the.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:14.950" end="00:41:19.030">First up we want to finish support for the universal windows...this</p>
      <p begin="00:41:19.030" end="00:41:23.920">means is we want to reach the same level of api stability and</p>
      <p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:30.560">future completeness as we have with windows eight-point the windows eight-point one version.</p>

      <p begin="00:41:45.070" end="00:41:49.190">...eighteen so we're waiting for waiting for the official windows</p>
      <p begin="00:41:49.190" end="00:41:54.530">are the next windows flight to go up before we pusher next release so we standby the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:54.530" end="00:41:59.340">quality and stability of new of wintry regardless of the version number</p>
      <p begin="00:41:59.340" end="00:42:03.940">...the version number means is that until we declare one-point-zero we want to have the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:03.940" end="00:42:07.460">ability to respond to developer feedback so we're not locking down</p>
      <p begin="00:42:07.460" end="00:42:10.830">or api surface once we reach one-point-zero</p>
      <p begin="00:42:10.830" end="00:42:13.700">...have a...have an api stable one point</p>
      <p begin="00:42:13.700" end="00:42:18.090">...released branch in addition to future parallel development branches</p>

      <p begin="00:42:23.890" end="00:42:29.020">expose all this new goodness that is com online in windows ten the</p>

      <p begin="00:43:44.800" end="00:43:46.510">for windows eight-point one you can ship a</p>
      <p begin="00:43:46.510" end="00:43:52.920">wintry app on the store today and very soon you'll be able to do so for windows ten.</p>

      <p begin="00:44:26.980" end="00:44:39.450">kind of amazing graphical experiences you can dream up thank you?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:39.450" end="00:44:43.070">So,yeah, if you have any questions we have to...on either side</p>
      <p begin="00:44:44.310" end="00:44:48.690">...and on the dx support the use of</p>
      <p begin="00:44:48.690" end="00:44:53.050">...from nine...or what's the minimal version of...dx.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:53.050" end="00:44:57.580">So, the question was what is the minimum version of direct some...so direct</p>
      <p begin="00:44:57.580" end="00:45:02.390">two-d and directorate are built on direct axle...so,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:02.390" end="00:45:04.260">we...so also if you're</p>
      <p begin="00:45:04.260" end="00:45:09.420">...for the universal windows platform you right against the direct x eleven api so,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:09.420" end="00:45:14.250">what so if you're not familiar direct eleven has this feature called</p>
      <p begin="00:45:14.250" end="00:45:19.250">feature levels and this allows you to use the directs eleven api but the target hardware</p>
      <p begin="00:45:19.250" end="00:45:23.010">that may not be capable of using exposing all the...features so,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:23.010" end="00:45:26.160">for example, phones like if you have a qualcomm chips that liken windows</p>
      <p begin="00:45:26.160" end="00:45:30.720">...most of those are direct text future level ninety-three you so use a directs</p>
      <p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:35.520">...api but there...to just restrict the api feature usage to what the</p>
      <p begin="00:45:35.520" end="00:45:40.420">us chip...support okay thank you of os windows seven no,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:40.420" end="00:45:44.450">we support windows eight one about the you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.450" end="00:45:47.320">the strategy that we have we really like everyone operate from windows</p>
      <p begin="00:45:47.320" end="00:45:53.420">sevento windows ten okay thank you do you have any plans to add</p>
      <p begin="00:45:53.420" end="00:45:57.680">...like traditional desktop applications because that's our main meat and</p>
      <p begin="00:45:57.680" end="00:46:00.470">we're doing like financial application for need update the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:00.470" end="00:46:05.640">screen very quickly and efficiently and draw lots of text and right now I've been</p>
      <p begin="00:46:05.640" end="00:46:09.800">experiment in doing that but like you cdf sharpen the direct to the library, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:09.800" end="00:46:13.740">and, basically making a texture than rendering that wpf?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:13.740" end="00:46:17.830">Right but, you know,...like it'd be nice library but it was like it's only for the universal</p>
      <p begin="00:46:17.830" end="00:46:18.660">...platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:20.220" end="00:46:24.250">Detailed musing all the other libraries we needs.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:24.250" end="00:46:26.660">So, we focused on obviously building utility piece of</p>
      <p begin="00:46:26.660" end="00:46:33.660">work first we should talk this is something we always want to know where you guys are trying to do with your api is well,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:33.660" end="00:46:41.650">if one after the talkative time like we should talk...and state.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:41.650" end="00:46:45.950">Is there an easy examples saving out the results on the canvas to</p>
      <p begin="00:46:45.950" end="00:46:52.670">file that's a good question we offer we have a helper I'm try to remember exactly what the name</p>
      <p begin="00:46:52.670" end="00:46:57.750">is basically...a single step just like load image asic we have a saving energy...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:57.750" end="00:47:01.500">you can just say about all...content yes?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:01.500" end="00:47:02.490">You some idea about</p>
      <p begin="00:47:02.490" end="00:47:08.700">...performance person to using readable bitmap...that not reasonable.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:08.700" end="00:47:11.910">Are you...this examples...bitmap, yeah, so,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:11.910" end="00:47:15.640">I'm not I'm not I'm not an expert...field we should you I can try to hook up with</p>
      <p begin="00:47:15.640" end="00:47:19.060">...people but one of the things, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:19.060" end="00:47:24.000">the readable bitmap is fundamentally cpu basically nothing you can access pixels directly so one</p>
      <p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:28.340">of the things you'll notice...to maintain maxim performance you want use</p>
      <p begin="00:47:28.340" end="00:47:37.550">a api that's...for gpu base rendering so, it depends on your scenario but?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:37.550" end="00:47:42.710">Sorry so,...scenario but they are they are slightly different scenarios there are and</p>
      <p begin="00:47:42.710" end="00:47:48.060">...can talk after you want more information thanks.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:48.060" end="00:47:53.120">...one thing before forget yes, please give us feedback.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:53.120" end="00:47:57.220">Free stuff is there any support for things other than graphics</p>
      <p begin="00:47:57.220" end="00:48:01.010">...like password cracking or stuff that uses cheap you</p>
      <p begin="00:48:01.010" end="00:48:04.450">...the cpu so I some is that something like gmmb.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:04.450" end="00:48:06.540">You kind of things share...</p>
      <p begin="00:48:06.540" end="00:48:11.120">it might be possible that's not one of the scenarios that we had in mind for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:11.120" end="00:48:15.100">one thing that you might want for gps direct access to pixel or compute</p>
      <p begin="00:48:15.100" end="00:48:16.600">shares in this case</p>
      <p begin="00:48:16.600" end="00:48:22.590">direct tutti so, directly actually does offer way to write to pixel</p>
      <p begin="00:48:22.590" end="00:48:27.510">...or computers but like at this point that's not explosion wintry that's we would love to</p>
      <p begin="00:48:27.510" end="00:48:32.480">...you have some like super idea that like I want to do this but I want csharp high-performance</p>
      <p begin="00:48:32.480" end="00:48:40.490">send us feedback like it'd be really interesting to say program.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:40.490" end="00:48:41.510">Okay, well,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:41.510" end="00:48:46.020">I guess we'll close...early I want to just thank everyone once again on behalf of the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:46.020" end="00:48:51.370">...the team so I will...the windows insider lounge for...our</p>
      <p begin="00:48:51.370" end="00:48:55.730">to ninety minutes after this if you want to talk to your asking more questions you also</p>
      <p begin="00:48:55.730" end="00:49:00.490">...find me tomorrow afternoon in the expert zone the download an expert</p>
      <p begin="00:49:00.490" end="00:49:04.000">...so-if you want-to talk me there also if you want to learn more about the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:04.000" end="00:49:08.890">wintry api and try to play around with it you should how head over to thequick start challenge</p>
      <p begin="00:49:08.890" end="00:49:14.340">...we have a wintry...takes about fifteen to thirty minutes and you can build</p>
      <p begin="00:49:14.340" end="00:49:17.490">and app in...that looks pretty similar to the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:17.490" end="00:49:23.030">...demo that I showed on stage thanks again enjoy the rest...bill.</p>
