      <p begin="00:00:10.380" end="00:00:15.160">...the after lunch session that's fine I appreciate you guys coming on the last day</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.160" end="00:00:19.280">is great did everybody go see a of...last night, yeah?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.320" end="00:00:25.160">That's good right james baiter just makes everything cool I can pretty much watch anything he's in so,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.160" end="00:00:29.510">thanks...common on the last a...really appreciate your time my name's thomas</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.510" end="00:00:34.370">...program manager in windows in the notifications team and I have andrew bars of me and...to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.370" end="00:00:40.540">be doing demos for us today so, let's just jump right and we got quite a bit of content.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.540" end="00:00:44.170">Before I get started evaluationswe are definitely highly competitive</p>
      <p begin="00:00:44.170" end="00:00:49.350">in my team and there's a developer who did a presentation from our team this year...a</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.350" end="00:00:52.350">...a natural rivalry so I really need to be them I need</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:59.400">a better score than john sheehan got so please evaluate if you like the session afterwards and if you didn't like it is known to it.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.400" end="00:01:03.390">...a quick intro about where you're at right now so if you've gone to some of the app model</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.390" end="00:01:07.960">sessions the application model session throughout this present...throughout the conference so far</p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.960" end="00:01:13.250">...seen some of this stuff I mean robber just finished his session on a kind of how apps...work your</p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.250" end="00:01:18.020">in our session now about shell really about how you integrator application with a lot of shel features and we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.020" end="00:01:22.840">talk about toasts tiles notifications in general so that's just a quick layer the land of all the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.840" end="00:01:27.140">other things you should go look at if you haven't seen them yet about the app model and integrating</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.140" end="00:01:29.930">...windows ten.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.930" end="00:01:32.530">So, I'm really excited about this year because this</p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.530" end="00:01:37.200">...actually very different from me this is my fourth year...build and every year when I'm up here on...at the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:41.940">costly think to myself don't talk about that new stuff that you're doing...talk about that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.940" end="00:01:46.750">stuff you did six months ago and keep the new stuff out of your presentation and this is the first</p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.750" end="00:01:51.670">year we're not doing that I'm talking to about what we're working on right now as a matter-of-fact</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.670" end="00:01:56.400">it's so bleeding edge that andrew may have a few glitches and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.400" end="00:02:00.550">his demo because it's from a custom build that we have just so we can show you the latest and greatest</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.550" end="00:02:04.920">stuff just bear with us if it's not exactly perfect but for the most part we think it's all going to work out for</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.920" end="00:02:08.300">you and that's great because I've never had a chance to tell you about the now</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.300" end="00:02:10.880">...the future at this conference that makes me really,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:10.880" end="00:02:15.890">really happy so what we heard from last year I just want to recap what</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.890" end="00:02:18.780">developers told us after we finish build last year...they said they want</p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.780" end="00:02:23.070">...the coming year last year when the big piece of feedback I got was that there's not</p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.070" end="00:02:25.860">programmers anymore okay people are now</p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.860" end="00:02:30.920">...programmers so I wanted to take that piece of feedback and immediately update that part of the slide?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:30.920" end="00:02:33.120">This powerpoint icon came with the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:37.460">...cycle like I didn't have to go find the unit cycle it was included as part of this</p>
      <p begin="00:02:37.460" end="00:02:42.750">guy and now seriously what we heard was...like what you're doing with convergence but we want to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.750" end="00:02:47.870">see more unity more convergence about windows apps so we're going to talk about that today you've heard a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:02:47.870" end="00:02:52.730">about the universal windows platform and universal windows apps today we're going to tell you a little bit more about how our stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.730" end="00:02:56.460">it's ended...you said how could you maybe, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.460" end="00:03:00.770">converge...you...to hire edit and she has the same company you have a phone you have things that</p>
      <p begin="00:03:00.770" end="00:03:05.640">are happening on desktop they don't really look like they're the same family so we're going to talk about some ui convergence as well</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.640" end="00:03:09.870">and the notification space you said well thanksgiving as a notification</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.870" end="00:03:14.350">center and action center as we call it and phone why is it in desktop ones that can</p>
      <p begin="00:03:14.350" end="00:03:19.240">happen so you've seen some of the flight some of the preview releases that we've had there are there is an action</p>
      <p begin="00:03:19.240" end="00:03:23.440">...continuing to evolve and it's continuing to get closer and closer between the phone and a desktop</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23.440" end="00:03:30.020">...I'll show you some more about where that's going...said please don't say more templates if the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.020" end="00:03:34.930">notifications spaces new...might not realizes but for those of you that have been doing windows tile and windows</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.930" end="00:03:40.070">toast notifications for a while you might know about the template catalog we...eighty-something templates</p>
      <p begin="00:03:40.070" end="00:03:44.970">in a template cataloging very many people told me last year that flexibility is not more</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.970" end="00:03:49.720">and more and more templates please don't come back next year and tell me that you gave me more templates so we'll talk</p>
      <p begin="00:03:49.720" end="00:03:54.220">about that too and finally more powerful notifications can do more with these can I make</p>
      <p begin="00:03:54.220" end="00:03:58.790">the more interactive so that my customer can do stuff faster so we're going to get into that as well today</p>
      <p begin="00:03:58.790" end="00:04:04.810">so we're done today...addressed all these...points the developers gave us from last year so first</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.810" end="00:04:09.680">of the theme of the conference...universal windows apps what does it mean in our case what</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.680" end="00:04:12.190">it actually means is that we were mostly done with the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.190" end="00:04:16.490">binary convergence the platform last year so we actually had pretty much everything unify</p>
      <p begin="00:04:16.490" end="00:04:21.280">...binary level when we talk to build last year but all the api...now fully</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21.280" end="00:04:26.150">converged as well so basically if you look at the api surface for notifications at the end of windows</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.150" end="00:04:31.390">phone eight one that's what's available now to any universal windows out it's a fully converge</p>
      <p begin="00:04:31.390" end="00:04:38.630">...all there that means things like managing your toes and action center all of that exists for you...</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.630" end="00:04:43.550">On top of that it's going to work everywhere on the windows device families so pc's mobile xbox I</p>
      <p begin="00:04:43.550" end="00:04:48.440">ot...all again part of the universal windows platform and that's great because just right</p>
      <p begin="00:04:48.440" end="00:04:53.230">...that are code for all these powerful things you can do a notifications now.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53.230" end="00:04:55.570">So, let's move on to talk a little bit about how the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:55.570" end="00:04:59.550">y is changing and evolving and what this the principles for when we did that look</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.550" end="00:05:03.540">like very quickly starting tiles...about a couple of really,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:03.540" end="00:05:06.300">really key things thousand need to be glanceable your</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.300" end="00:05:11.590">consuming information from tiles or something that's...quickly learn about what's going on</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.590" end="00:05:15.930">...application it's you're really kind of most obvious way to connect with your customer because</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.930" end="00:05:21.120">they're always on start so they need some way to quickly consume that information before they even...so it's all</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.120" end="00:05:26.610">about glance ability it's also about of course actually launching the app wouldn't be any good if they couldn't get</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.610" end="00:05:31.410">into it so just like every other platform out there have to have some way to launch into the apps that's another really</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31.410" end="00:05:35.440">key principle about start...tiles...for how you actually take actions to get inside the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:40.020">app the doorway into your app it's the way the user gets in so let's see what</p>
      <p begin="00:05:40.020" end="00:05:45.710">actually looks like in practice in that case so I'm going to talk to a little bit about</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.710" end="00:05:50.520">start the layout of tiles I'm going to do some things about talking about density because when you think about the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:50.520" end="00:05:55.230">family of devices that we have now from all the way down from mobile really small devices to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:55.230" end="00:06:00.400">pc's to huge devices like surface hub there's a lot of screen densities</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.400" end="00:06:05.460">available now so we talk about our tiles and kind of this grid it'snot a real pixel</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.460" end="00:06:10.430">...obviously it's kind of relative pixel grid for us but how sizes break down into a pixel grid for us</p>
      <p begin="00:06:10.430" end="00:06:14.960">and starts with the smallest tile if you look at number one up on the screen that's the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:14.960" end="00:06:18.740">small tile for us that's a one by one tile we have the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.740" end="00:06:23.600">medium tile two-by-two we have the wide tile which is four by two and then we also still</p>
      <p begin="00:06:23.600" end="00:06:28.850">have the large tile and the large tile is still desktop only that's not going to be an mobile for now and,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:28.850" end="00:06:31.290">it's a four-by-four so essentially this is the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:31.290" end="00:06:36.210">basis for everything that we do going forward and for how we think about screen density and being able to</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.210" end="00:06:41.190">...those things on all the different devices that we have so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.190" end="00:06:45.880">tiles are not always going to be the same-size because of that this is an example of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.880" end="00:06:50.040">a high-density screen you can think of this is something like a leukemia fifteen twenty something that has a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.040" end="00:06:53.810">really nice display on you can fit a lot of tiles on the screen</p>
      <p begin="00:06:53.810" end="00:06:58.370">but we also have devices out there that are more like a loomis six thirty five and this may be the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.370" end="00:07:03.340">...density that they're able to display and you can see that I'll go back and forth there</p>
      <p begin="00:07:03.340" end="00:07:07.190">are definitely a different density so...different amounts of information that you can fit</p>
      <p begin="00:07:07.190" end="00:07:09.990">on these tiles the adapt to the screen there on the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:09.990" end="00:07:14.530">...are actually scaling depending on the density of the screen we've done some other stuff like reducing</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.530" end="00:07:19.110">margins to make all this work a little better but this doesn't just apply to mobile I know</p>
      <p begin="00:07:19.110" end="00:07:22.910">...used phones examples but it applies to desktops and applies to anything with</p>
      <p begin="00:07:22.910" end="00:07:27.830">...screen density that can change so a lot of what we did this time around was to make sure we...adapt</p>
      <p begin="00:07:27.830" end="00:07:31.040">...densities and just give you the best-looking tile no</p>
      <p begin="00:07:31.040" end="00:07:36.380">matter what devices actually running on so with that let's talk about the tiles...the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:36.380" end="00:07:41.300">...that you can use as a developer yourself like I said there is a legacy template</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.300" end="00:07:44.390">catalog out there today it's eighty plus templates out</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44.390" end="00:07:49.260">there and we did get the feed that back that the templates are okay but we don't really just want more</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.260" end="00:07:54.670">template so that's we addressed most of our work was not just enhancing additional templates but I just</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.670" end="00:07:59.420">want-to let-you know that all the legacy temples are just going to continue to work there's nothing that stopping those temples</p>
      <p begin="00:07:59.420" end="00:08:04.420">working they actually look even better they've been given some visual ui refresh as well whenever they are</p>
      <p begin="00:08:04.420" end="00:08:09.400">shown on windows ten so you can keep using all that stuff if you're already using it today you don't actually have</p>
      <p begin="00:08:09.400" end="00:08:14.020">to change however we are doing something new called adaptive tile</p>
      <p begin="00:08:14.020" end="00:08:18.680">templates so this is a template that does not need...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:18.680" end="00:08:23.510">is instead of having multiple templates this is really just a set of for templates for small medium</p>
      <p begin="00:08:23.510" end="00:08:26.690">widen large tiles that are incredibly flexible you can</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.690" end="00:08:30.890">do really great stuff inside these templates to layout your content your images so</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30.890" end="00:08:35.400">that looks really great and create a lot of scenarios without having to just use a background image or</p>
      <p begin="00:08:35.400" end="00:08:38.680">without using a static template so you get a lot more flexibility and we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:08:38.680" end="00:08:43.000">talk now about what that all looks like and how you do it so</p>
      <p begin="00:08:43.000" end="00:08:47.590">introducing adaptive our templates hopefully the feedback this...for build won't be any more</p>
      <p begin="00:08:47.590" end="00:08:49.360">...because...only really for that</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:55.000">...the real principle here is that the contents will adapt with the tile</p>
      <p begin="00:08:55.000" end="00:08:59.030">nine notice looks like a small medium and large tile but</p>
      <p begin="00:08:59.030" end="00:09:03.950">it's not this is the same tile and it's changing depending on the density</p>
      <p begin="00:09:03.950" end="00:09:07.650">the screen it's running on can display so on</p>
      <p begin="00:09:07.650" end="00:09:12.600">the far-left that is a very low density screen you can see it's not actually able to display</p>
      <p begin="00:09:12.600" end="00:09:17.520">that much content...some content but not as much as when you move to like something like a</p>
      <p begin="00:09:17.520" end="00:09:22.250">medium density screen in the middle or even a large density screen on the right remember</p>
      <p begin="00:09:22.250" end="00:09:26.690">that's still all medium tile but on a high-density screen because you can put so much</p>
      <p begin="00:09:26.690" end="00:09:31.620">more information inside there we can actually display more information and we wanted to take advantage of that</p>
      <p begin="00:09:31.620" end="00:09:37.960">so let me show you how you would actually achieve that we still use xml for</p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.960" end="00:09:40.800">our templates so we're still have a basic xml</p>
      <p begin="00:09:40.800" end="00:09:45.890">layout that you use and there's a couple of key things to point out here to make this actual</p>
      <p begin="00:09:45.890" end="00:09:50.700">situation work so if you look at the groups and the subgroups that I've got here?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:50.700" end="00:09:53.990">Groups are about semantically binding information together so,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.990" end="00:09:58.530">for example, in this email case john those email and...the first couple lines from john</p>
      <p begin="00:09:58.530" end="00:10:01.040">...email makes sense to be displayed together as</p>
      <p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:05.660">a group you want your user to see all of that content together because it just gets a better experience</p>
      <p begin="00:10:05.660" end="00:10:09.950">and jane those email...the same kind of thing you'd really want to have all of her email content</p>
      <p begin="00:10:09.950" end="00:10:15.030">shown together you notice that on the small and the medium tile gino's email isn't</p>
      <p begin="00:10:15.030" end="00:10:19.060">shown at all and that's because it's in a different group you said to us as</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.060" end="00:10:23.480">a developer semantically this information needs to sit together so only display if you</p>
      <p begin="00:10:23.480" end="00:10:27.460">can display everything inside this group so that's why as we move up</p>
      <p begin="00:10:27.460" end="00:10:32.140">the densities we get to a point where that medium tile has enough density to show all the information</p>
      <p begin="00:10:32.140" end="00:10:36.620">include the additional group so that's where the adaptive nys of the tower</p>
      <p begin="00:10:36.620" end="00:10:41.030">really takes advantage of what you want to send as a developer to give the best possible experience</p>
      <p begin="00:10:41.030" end="00:10:45.830">...all devices I want to give kind of another example of this as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:45.830" end="00:10:50.010">This is a pretty simple example about re flowing text on the medium-size</p>
      <p begin="00:10:50.010" end="00:10:54.950">tile you can actually see quite all of the text in the string on the sm tile</p>
      <p begin="00:10:54.950" end="00:10:59.030">on the medium-size of the medium tell you can on the most dense part of</p>
      <p begin="00:10:59.030" end="00:11:02.480">the medium tile you can see the entire string and the way I've done that</p>
      <p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:06.680">is actually pretty simply if you look in the xml for text hint</p>
      <p begin="00:11:06.680" end="00:11:11.320">...equals true I've just said...this text whenever you can and all of the tiles of</p>
      <p begin="00:11:11.320" end="00:11:15.200">...the medium tiles is tried to...the...just that on the lowest</p>
      <p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:18.830">density screen there wasn't a way to fit quite all of it but on the highest density screen on the</p>
      <p begin="00:11:18.830" end="00:11:24.500">medium tile I was able to fit all of...so we displayed all of it on the...we get to the demos a little bit later and</p>
      <p begin="00:11:24.500" end="00:11:28.500">is going to show you some really cool stuff...this is going to show you some much more advanced examples but I just wanted</p>
      <p begin="00:11:28.500" end="00:11:33.420">...t up some of the conversations that he's going to be having a little bit?</p>
      <p begin="00:11:33.420" end="00:11:38.420">One of the talk a little bit about the state of tiles to so there's three</p>
      <p begin="00:11:38.420" end="00:11:43.250">basic states of adaptive tiles and really this first state is just your tile as it</p>
      <p begin="00:11:43.250" end="00:11:48.110">exists whenever you're app is first install so you the sm tile as a medium</p>
      <p begin="00:11:48.110" end="00:11:52.720">tiles a wide town a large thailand this example they're all just using assets that came directly from</p>
      <p begin="00:11:52.720" end="00:11:56.770">your package so this is just without any tile updates yet what</p>
      <p begin="00:11:56.770" end="00:12:00.220">your tile would look like with the user tended to start and resize that this</p>
      <p begin="00:12:00.220" end="00:12:06.030">is a simplest state your tile can be in this before you really done anything to it from a notification respect.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:06.030" end="00:12:09.730">We have a semi live state this is really when you're trying to communicate</p>
      <p begin="00:12:09.730" end="00:12:14.240">...small amount of information to the user makes sense or something like account you want to update the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:14.240" end="00:12:18.540">count on the tile the badge...information for your user and it's, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:18.540" end="00:12:22.340">just a very quick way for the user glance and see that something's changed inside</p>
      <p begin="00:12:22.340" end="00:12:27.910">your application the next state of courses the one that most people use and that's the live state</p>
      <p begin="00:12:27.910" end="00:12:32.710">of the tile again I've got the template names up...to see tile small tom medium</p>
      <p begin="00:12:32.710" end="00:12:37.040">...wide and tile large that's all you need from now on if you want to use the adaptive</p>
      <p begin="00:12:37.040" end="00:12:40.830">how templates all we've got we don't have any new anymore templates other than those</p>
      <p begin="00:12:40.830" end="00:12:46.470">for...showing a lot of text examples but it's going to get a lot more interesting in a minute so,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:46.470" end="00:12:50.840">the live state is a state where you have more content showing is not just a badge now</p>
      <p begin="00:12:50.840" end="00:12:55.690">your to doing some text on the tau you maybe doing some images...can I show you what that</p>
      <p begin="00:12:55.690" end="00:13:00.080">looks like another view I just have a slide that kind of breaks it down.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:00.080" end="00:13:05.010">Into the layers that exist so again in the basic state of the tile this</p>
      <p begin="00:13:05.010" end="00:13:09.810">is before you've done anything to it you have the following layers have the plate which is really just a fancy word</p>
      <p begin="00:13:09.810" end="00:13:14.230">...the background color you have an apple logo so this is out of your manifest the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:14.230" end="00:13:18.940">square one fifty by one fifty logo that you have then you have the short name this is really just</p>
      <p begin="00:13:18.940" end="00:13:23.110">the name that you've given your app in the manifest again this is when you've done nothing to your tile these are the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:23.110" end="00:13:28.120">layers that exist and what this how the system build them up to show your tile and</p>
      <p begin="00:13:28.120" end="00:13:33.090">the semi live state really only one layers added and that's the badge that gets added over the top</p>
      <p begin="00:13:33.090" end="00:13:36.980">...the bottom right corner you see it is the top layer and that stacking of layers</p>
      <p begin="00:13:36.980" end="00:13:41.160">again nothing else about the tile has really changed is your square one fifty by one fifty logo</p>
      <p begin="00:13:41.160" end="00:13:46.010">in the middle the badges now and the bottom righted still using your logo for the or sorry</p>
      <p begin="00:13:46.010" end="00:13:51.530">...short name from the app because all you really done is update the badge count this example?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:51.530" end="00:13:55.250">And, finally in the live state is where a whole new layers introduced</p>
      <p begin="00:13:55.250" end="00:13:59.980">that gets really interesting so if you look now the second layer from the bottom is now</p>
      <p begin="00:13:59.980" end="00:14:04.270">your content layer this is where you can do things like images you can do</p>
      <p begin="00:14:04.270" end="00:14:08.220">tax you can do great new stuff that's going to show you on the next slide this is really where</p>
      <p begin="00:14:08.220" end="00:14:12.880">you insert the stuff that you...light your user with information and really bring your tile to life</p>
      <p begin="00:14:12.880" end="00:14:17.270">...this content layer so let's move on to talk about the content</p>
      <p begin="00:14:17.270" end="00:14:20.500">...content notifications can display and image like I said</p>
      <p begin="00:14:20.500" end="00:14:25.390">...combination of those things sometimes inline...not sometimes the full background I</p>
      <p begin="00:14:25.390" end="00:14:30.320">wanted to give you some examples of real tiles that are being built for our internal</p>
      <p begin="00:14:30.320" end="00:14:33.660">...microsoft apps that are actually being built and shipping in the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:33.660" end="00:14:38.510">stores part of windows ten and what they did and how they're tiles are going to look using this actual</p>
      <p begin="00:14:38.510" end="00:14:43.080">adaptive...so we'll start with the one that we've been showing so far is the mail tile</p>
      <p begin="00:14:43.080" end="00:14:46.540">...just text on a tile because that makes more sense...you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:14:46.540" end="00:14:51.070">see what's going on in reality if you had something like...attach...attachment and</p>
      <p begin="00:14:51.070" end="00:14:55.570">email they could be showing that on the...well if they want as an inline image but for this simple example</p>
      <p begin="00:14:55.570" end="00:14:59.110">just showing the ...from and...the first-line of the mail,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:59.110" end="00:15:03.580">for example,...next one is actually from the calendar app so this is</p>
      <p begin="00:15:03.580" end="00:15:08.270">text just basically on the tile pretty simple again but it's on a wide tile</p>
      <p begin="00:15:08.270" end="00:15:14.150">and this case is just got more information on it because it's a wide tyler stretches a little wider here's something a</p>
      <p begin="00:15:14.150" end="00:15:17.670">little more complex so this is what a whether tile could do so this one</p>
      <p begin="00:15:17.670" end="00:15:22.520">...inline image and some text grouping are able achieve all of this with the adaptive mark-up and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:22.520" end="00:15:27.290">...actually going to take you through this one and just a little bit?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:27.290" end="00:15:32.210">You've got some pretty simple examples the music app could just use a background image in this case...using</p>
      <p begin="00:15:32.210" end="00:15:36.870">album art...background image and it could just put the name of the album and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:36.870" end="00:15:40.850">the name of the...on the front that once...background image which sometimes you</p>
      <p begin="00:15:40.850" end="00:15:45.240">...a full bleed image all the way across the back and just...some text on the front</p>
      <p begin="00:15:45.240" end="00:15:50.340">...your even able to control the overlay as well so if you wanted to have the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:50.340" end="00:15:56.840">image kind of be darkened a little bit to make text display a little better you can do that as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:56.840" end="00:16:00.120">And, finally the last example something like the xbox</p>
      <p begin="00:16:00.120" end="00:16:04.770">tile this is what something very similar with the games app is actually going to ship and this is an inline image</p>
      <p begin="00:16:04.770" end="00:16:08.670">and text and kind of in some columns and again all done with the adaptive layouts got</p>
      <p begin="00:16:08.670" end="00:16:13.540">an image I've got some bigger text of the top a couple of lines of subtle text underneath it created with the adaptive</p>
      <p begin="00:16:13.540" end="00:16:18.600">...so now I want to actually flip over to andru so that he can do the demo and show</p>
      <p begin="00:16:18.600" end="00:16:26.230">you how all this works in the real-world...code on what is hopefully stable...</p>
      <p begin="00:16:26.230" end="00:16:31.170">as...talked about these adaptive tiles let-you create really powerful tiles really easily so</p>
      <p begin="00:16:31.170" end="00:16:33.780">what we're using here that you can see it's called</p>
      <p begin="00:16:33.780" end="00:16:38.670">...template visualize are going to ship a tool like this for you guys that you can play around</p>
      <p begin="00:16:38.670" end="00:16:43.450">with the tiled templates really quickly and we're going to do is we're going to walk through how you</p>
      <p begin="00:16:43.450" end="00:16:47.750">would actually start design your live tile so over on the right we have</p>
      <p begin="00:16:47.750" end="00:16:52.230">our default app state as you can see there and we're going to start by sending</p>
      <p begin="00:16:52.230" end="00:16:57.610">a tile payload here and basically it's all xml as you saw with</p>
      <p begin="00:16:57.610" end="00:17:01.890">...examples and you have a tile and visual element and then you have your</p>
      <p begin="00:17:01.890" end="00:17:06.000">bindings for each size we're just going to start by working on the medium tile</p>
      <p begin="00:17:06.000" end="00:17:10.370">says you can see over on the right there the medium tile is blank</p>
      <p begin="00:17:10.370" end="00:17:14.530">renounced we have no...so we can add some text.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:14.530" end="00:17:18.070">Hello, san francisco.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:18.070" end="00:17:23.050">And, you'll see that appear over on the medium tile and we can add another line attacks</p>
      <p begin="00:17:23.050" end="00:17:27.880">is basically a stack panel welcome to build two thousand fifteen.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:27.880" end="00:17:32.020">And, we got to lines attacks going there so that works really well but we</p>
      <p begin="00:17:32.020" end="00:17:36.000">...many make it look a little better so we can add some styles.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:39.300">Hint style body that'll make the tax...bit bigger as</p>
      <p begin="00:17:39.300" end="00:17:44.060">...hello san-francisco got bigger and the second-line we won that the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:44.060" end="00:17:48.210">...so we can say hint...</p>
      <p begin="00:17:48.210" end="00:17:52.800">And, now we have rapping tax and we can also add a style to that.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:52.800" end="00:17:54.910">Of captions subtle.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:54.910" end="00:18:00.280">To great out a little bit.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:00.280" end="00:18:00.750">I do that because</p>
      <p begin="00:18:00.750" end="00:18:05.660">...kind of run yet into the icon epsy got full control of your apps branding you can</p>
      <p begin="00:18:05.660" end="00:18:10.590">choose logo only you can have the name and logo or just the name and on</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.590" end="00:18:12.720">at medium tile we don't have much space</p>
      <p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:17.270">will just display the apps logo and now we want to design our wide</p>
      <p begin="00:18:17.270" end="00:18:21.290">...tiles we can use basically the same code here so I'm just going to copy</p>
      <p begin="00:18:21.290" end="00:18:25.920">paced and then add a tile why'd template</p>
      <p begin="00:18:25.920" end="00:18:30.870">there and as you can see it works pretty well the tax expands to</p>
      <p begin="00:18:30.870" end="00:18:35.730">the valuable size and we can include the apps name...we have...more</p>
      <p begin="00:18:35.730" end="00:18:43.330">space on the tile and then we'll do the same thing for our large tile.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:43.330" end="00:18:46.120">And, there we go we designer tile looks good so</p>
      <p begin="00:18:46.120" end="00:18:50.430">redundant the design side now we can actually throw this into our app and you can</p>
      <p begin="00:18:50.430" end="00:18:55.410">get content on your tiles a variety of ways we just built a little simple</p>
      <p begin="00:18:55.410" end="00:18:59.340">...where we can paste in the xml and I'll turn it into</p>
      <p begin="00:18:59.340" end="00:19:04.230">a tile so right now we have three tiles pinned here and I pasted in</p>
      <p begin="00:19:04.230" end="00:19:09.280">our code that we just wrote and we'll update those tiles and you'll see those new</p>
      <p begin="00:19:09.280" end="00:19:14.270">content appear on the actual start screen so really easy to create beautiful looking</p>
      <p begin="00:19:14.270" end="00:19:17.480">...tiles one thing I want to point out there with that those three tiles</p>
      <p begin="00:19:17.480" end="00:19:21.730">...on start now those got pinned at the same time if you've been a windows,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:21.730" end="00:19:26.640">windows phone developer for a little while you might have in the tile and had to go back and...another tile you</p>
      <p begin="00:19:26.640" end="00:19:31.630">...multiple tiles at...now you can multiple thousand once the start screen if you want</p>
      <p begin="00:19:31.630" end="00:19:34.660">...because we heard a lot of feedback that was a pain people navigate</p>
      <p begin="00:19:34.660" end="00:19:39.160">...the app on phone some people even thought the apples crashing when your navigated out of it</p>
      <p begin="00:19:39.160" end="00:19:44.210">the start screen so now you can...multiple tile because it's about.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:44.210" end="00:19:45.930">Yep, and,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:45.930" end="00:19:50.350">in...demo he talked about the mel tile so...how you actually create that</p>
      <p begin="00:19:50.350" end="00:19:54.540">mail tile and if we look at the wide</p>
      <p begin="00:19:54.540" end="00:19:59.140">tile here you can see the content for wide has those two groups and</p>
      <p begin="00:19:59.140" end="00:20:03.960">group semantically mean that the content passed a fit completely for to actually</p>
      <p begin="00:20:03.960" end="00:20:06.300">make sense so since steve</p>
      <p begin="00:20:06.300" end="00:20:11.560">...on the wide tile can't fit it doesn't appear but on the large tile which is the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:11.560" end="00:20:15.100">exact same content just on the large it fits</p>
      <p begin="00:20:15.100" end="00:20:19.940">we display it and then the weather tile which was the...has a lot of fancy</p>
      <p begin="00:20:19.940" end="00:20:24.720">stuff going on if we look here we're on the tile why'd.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:24.720" end="00:20:29.350">You can place and image in the background by saying placement background and then you can do</p>
      <p begin="00:20:29.350" end="00:20:34.230">those subgroups which are columns and that's how we achieve over on the wide tile</p>
      <p begin="00:20:34.230" end="00:20:38.560">those four columns and we can actually delete one of these subgroups here and you'll</p>
      <p begin="00:20:38.560" end="00:20:43.340">see all go down to three columns so you have a lot of our and control you can set</p>
      <p begin="00:20:43.340" end="00:20:48.150">weights on the columns do a lot of fancy stuff and also those images you can set them to</p>
      <p begin="00:20:48.150" end="00:20:54.120">be placement inline and that's how you achieve those placements there so on the theme</p>
      <p begin="00:20:54.120" end="00:20:56.070">...wanted to create a hips</p>
      <p begin="00:20:56.070" end="00:21:00.090">...app called hips to me that I'll tell you where the newest hips</p>
      <p begin="00:21:00.090" end="00:21:04.870">...showed up so we design this live tile and this guy's been spotted down on</p>
      <p begin="00:21:04.870" end="00:21:08.170">...shows little map on the large tile since we got</p>
      <p begin="00:21:08.170" end="00:21:12.720">a lot of space there and we have this tile designed here and we can do the</p>
      <p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:17.980">same thing copied over into our windows ten app here and update</p>
      <p begin="00:21:17.980" end="00:21:27.830">...live tile and you'll see that content appear on our start screen here.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:27.830" end="00:21:32.320">And, then the other way there's a lot of ways to get content your live tiles</p>
      <p begin="00:21:32.320" end="00:21:36.460">...doing local updates there but there's also periodic polling which</p>
      <p begin="00:21:36.460" end="00:21:39.660">would probably use that helps to app and basically with periodic</p>
      <p begin="00:21:39.660" end="00:21:44.410">polling you have a website here and we would have a web server that generates</p>
      <p begin="00:21:44.410" end="00:21:48.950">that tile xml content and then all the tile does is it periodically</p>
      <p begin="00:21:48.950" end="00:21:52.640">polls that url the pull down the new content and update your</p>
      <p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:57.730">live tile so if we look at the code behind for that all we do to create</p>
      <p begin="00:21:57.730" end="00:22:01.660">a polling tile is we create the tile and we</p>
      <p begin="00:22:01.660" end="00:22:06.120">...it and as thomas said it doesn't throw you back out to start so you can instantly</p>
      <p begin="00:22:06.120" end="00:22:11.070">do code after that and right here is that code where you actually</p>
      <p begin="00:22:11.070" end="00:22:16.280">set the periodic tile the...down from your url I which is over here and we can go</p>
      <p begin="00:22:16.280" end="00:22:20.420">over to our uw p and.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:20.420" end="00:22:24.840">...that tile so.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:24.840" end="00:22:29.390">Here we go will click pan and now be added to our start screen hopefully if the internet plays with</p>
      <p begin="00:22:29.390" end="00:22:34.530">us yep and it pulled down that...we got our live tile.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:35.570" end="00:22:40.360">The back to...okay thanks andrew.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:40.360" end="00:22:44.860">hopefully you see that there's a lot of flexibility and what we did with the adapted templates we</p>
      <p begin="00:22:44.860" end="00:22:49.800">really took the feedback the heart that you want to be able to late things out...a simple...effective way</p>
      <p begin="00:22:49.800" end="00:22:54.800">so that's why we've done this technology it's pretty straightforward but there's also some powerful stuff we've</p>
      <p begin="00:22:54.800" end="00:22:59.660">seen people doing internally and we hope to see what you guys do it we think it's going to be a fantastic addition to</p>
      <p begin="00:22:59.660" end="00:23:05.050">your apps I wanted to talk a little bit about the api as we didn't talk about because there are a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:23:05.050" end="00:23:09.050">api the notifications...space and we're not going to cover them all today but really</p>
      <p begin="00:23:09.050" end="00:23:14.020">there all the same as what they were before...say at the end of windows phone...wanted to go local was</p>
      <p begin="00:23:14.020" end="00:23:17.350">in these namespaces the same one still available to interviewed</p>
      <p begin="00:23:17.350" end="00:23:21.670">...and windows out you...notifications which is where you really do things</p>
      <p begin="00:23:21.670" end="00:23:24.330">...thailand posts that's badge update manager</p>
      <p begin="00:23:24.330" end="00:23:27.640">schedule tile notification tile of the manager and windows</p>
      <p begin="00:23:27.640" end="00:23:32.230">...start screen is where you do secondary tiles all that stuff is still there...still</p>
      <p begin="00:23:32.230" end="00:23:37.160">exists is just going to work exactly like it used to work if you're using that code or even if you have to become</p>
      <p begin="00:23:37.160" end="00:23:44.410">new to this code that's fine whatever's on msdn today is exactly what's going to be supported in your</p>
      <p begin="00:23:44.410" end="00:23:48.040">So, I also wanted to touch a little bit on how we send tile updates because andrew</p>
      <p begin="00:23:48.040" end="00:23:52.140">and I showed you local and polling but there's multiple ways that you can send tile updates</p>
      <p begin="00:23:52.140" end="00:23:56.100">your app so local is basically your immediate update scenario you can do it for</p>
      <p begin="00:23:56.100" end="00:24:01.070">the foreground you can do it from the background local tile updates never expire tiles</p>
      <p begin="00:24:01.070" end="00:24:05.840">have a concept of expiration especially when they're done something like a push server but we do a</p>
      <p begin="00:24:05.840" end="00:24:10.700">local tile update they don't ever expire because we assume that you're going to come back and clean-up your content at some</p>
      <p begin="00:24:10.700" end="00:24:17.060">point to a background task or something you have control over that if you want new content to show.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:17.060" end="00:24:19.850">You also have schedule tile updates so scheduled</p>
      <p begin="00:24:19.850" end="00:24:24.530">...is really exactly what it sounds like a specific date and time I want this tile to</p>
      <p begin="00:24:24.530" end="00:24:29.510">change and those expire after three days because they appear to be time-sensitive in the first-place</p>
      <p begin="00:24:29.510" end="00:24:35.610">so you can do a schedule pick a specific time tile...the schedules how you get to this guy.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:35.610" end="00:24:37.380">What andrew showed so,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:37.380" end="00:24:42.010">periodic is really about having the tile update on a kind of a regular occurrence you have</p>
      <p begin="00:24:42.010" end="00:24:46.930">a uri you have some time period that you want update on over and over again because the xml</p>
      <p begin="00:24:46.930" end="00:24:49.700">in the cloud is regenerated on a frequent basis and this is where</p>
      <p begin="00:24:49.700" end="00:24:53.470">...content comes from so start periodic updated how you get to that guy</p>
      <p begin="00:24:54.740" end="00:25:00.430">then finally something we're not actually talking about very much today is push notifications that you do tile updates</p>
      <p begin="00:25:00.430" end="00:25:05.230">as well and everything that we're showing you today all the xml all these features they all work</p>
      <p begin="00:25:05.230" end="00:25:10.000">to push notifications as well so if you can do it with the xml you...the push server</p>
      <p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:12.370">...just work it's a really great way to</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.370" end="00:25:16.340">do real-time information push notifications expire after three days again because</p>
      <p begin="00:25:16.340" end="00:25:21.890">we're kind of time-sensitive it's one of the most popular ways to send a notifications so you can directly</p>
      <p begin="00:25:21.890" end="00:25:26.780">...notification...there's also raw notifications so...to talk a lot about tiles</p>
      <p begin="00:25:26.780" end="00:25:30.870">and toast today but a raw push notification is a really powerful thing available</p>
      <p begin="00:25:30.870" end="00:25:34.710">on the pap platform...less you send basically...of shoulder</p>
      <p begin="00:25:34.710" end="00:25:39.670">...to wake-up your background task and then you can do whatever you want...actually see a lot of apps move</p>
      <p begin="00:25:39.670" end="00:25:43.590">into a model where instead of sending a tyler toast notification specifically to the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:43.590" end="00:25:47.560">push server this into raw wake-up their background task and then do something from</p>
      <p begin="00:25:47.560" end="00:25:52.800">that background tasked update...thaler properties and it seems to be a pretty powerful model because you have a local</p>
      <p begin="00:25:52.800" end="00:25:59.710">...of local client state you can use in those scenarios to give the most relevant notification to the user?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:59.710" end="00:26:03.850">And, I want to talk a little bit about beyond adapted tiles as well because like I said we're talking to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:03.850" end="00:26:08.710">about stuff it's not just from right now it's from coming soon as well so this is my</p>
      <p begin="00:26:08.710" end="00:26:12.930">...this my breaking into jail slide because I feel like I'm going to get these questions at the end of the talk anyway so I</p>
      <p begin="00:26:12.930" end="00:26:18.220">want to just kind of get this stuff out there one greatly thing that's coming that's going to be really</p>
      <p begin="00:26:18.220" end="00:26:23.250">helpful is something called example rendering background task now this existed in windows phone</p>
      <p begin="00:26:23.250" end="00:26:28.230">eight one but it's never existed in desktop...now exist for anything that's a universal windows</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.230" end="00:26:33.130">app essentially it's a way for you to create content you can take and create</p>
      <p begin="00:26:33.130" end="00:26:35.840">...controls and stuff in visual that you</p>
      <p begin="00:26:35.840" end="00:26:40.560">like and then render it to an actual image that you then for the whole image on your tile</p>
      <p begin="00:26:40.560" end="00:26:45.150">so whenever adaptive doesn't quite meet your needs you need to do something a little more advanced or something we have</p>
      <p begin="00:26:45.150" end="00:26:47.560">enabled for-you you-can...rendering background</p>
      <p begin="00:26:47.560" end="00:26:54.020">task just render an image and make a kollek awesome that way it's available now to all universal windows...</p>
      <p begin="00:26:54.020" end="00:26:57.710">I know I'm going to get this question so I'm going-to go ahead and talk about it you're showing</p>
      <p begin="00:26:57.710" end="00:27:00.620">...xml it seems relatively powerful...you just give us</p>
      <p begin="00:27:00.620" end="00:27:05.420">example why is are not just them on the tiles and that's a great question and it's something that we</p>
      <p begin="00:27:05.420" end="00:27:09.150">want to do we think there's two categories of developers and we've seen this and</p>
      <p begin="00:27:09.150" end="00:27:13.110">other ecosystems as well there's developers want to spend...some amount of time other</p>
      <p begin="00:27:13.110" end="00:27:17.830">tile they don't have an infinite budget we all know that sometimes we have a lot of money to spend on something</p>
      <p begin="00:27:17.830" end="00:27:22.500">like a tile sometimes you only have a little if you just want to do something quick easy very effective</p>
      <p begin="00:27:22.500" end="00:27:26.170">and very flexible...is perfect for that if you're</p>
      <p begin="00:27:26.170" end="00:27:30.640">a really powerful them all developer and you're thinking yourself off I just had sample I can</p>
      <p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:34.560">do often storyboards I could do awesome animations we understand</p>
      <p begin="00:27:34.560" end="00:27:39.430">that we're going to enable that as well as example tiles or something...actively working on and we're</p>
      <p begin="00:27:39.430" end="00:27:44.290">going to bring that to the platform at some point in reality we're not actually there yet so we don't</p>
      <p begin="00:27:44.290" end="00:27:48.180">have as example start screen on mobile we do on desktop if you didn't know</p>
      <p begin="00:27:48.180" end="00:27:53.250">what the start menu on desktop is really just...same goes for notification to action center it's really just</p>
      <p begin="00:27:53.250" end="00:27:58.860">...but we don't have...on mobile yet and we're working on it so we're actually limited by our own</p>
      <p begin="00:27:58.860" end="00:28:03.590">technology in this case and we're going to make that change so that we can bring something like example tiles</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.590" end="00:28:08.590">developers who really want to spend the time to do it one other point I want to make that is sometimes</p>
      <p begin="00:28:08.590" end="00:28:11.720">overlooked is that push notifications</p>
      <p begin="00:28:11.720" end="00:28:15.720">are great but sending example down for a push notification</p>
      <p begin="00:28:15.720" end="00:28:20.780">...really ugly like can you imagine all of...you need to create a really awesome tile</p>
      <p begin="00:28:20.780" end="00:28:24.780">...deal with escaping and worrying about all that...this and it down for push notification</p>
      <p begin="00:28:24.780" end="00:28:29.490">and I'm not even sure we would support some really big example because we only let you have four-k of total size</p>
      <p begin="00:28:29.490" end="00:28:34.690">...payload so, flexible sorry adaptive templates are better for something</p>
      <p begin="00:28:34.690" end="00:28:39.040">like push notifications they give you a lot of flexibility without so quite so much texan</p>
      <p begin="00:28:39.040" end="00:28:43.840">...notification so that's important thing to take into consideration about why we do both</p>
      <p begin="00:28:43.840" end="00:28:49.760">technologies and then finally...this question too what about interactive tiles,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:49.760" end="00:28:54.690">come on, give me something where I can actually have like a button or some interaction on the tile itself and it's not</p>
      <p begin="00:28:54.690" end="00:28:59.610">something we've got quite yet but is something that we actively explored...on my team has been exploring this</p>
      <p begin="00:28:59.610" end="00:29:04.400">for this entire release we're looking at how we can make interactivity on tiles something really,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:04.400" end="00:29:08.380">really awesome for developers and we have a lot of ideas that we're thinking about ways that you</p>
      <p begin="00:29:08.380" end="00:29:09.490">...deeply from your tiles,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:09.490" end="00:29:13.860">for example, so, I just wanted to throw out there that we haven't forgotten about these features we</p>
      <p begin="00:29:13.860" end="00:29:20.350">know you guys want this stuff and we're going to work on it and find a way to bring...to you in the near future.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:20.350" end="00:29:24.340">So, now let's shift gears a little bit we spent some time talking about tiles now let's talk</p>
      <p begin="00:29:24.340" end="00:29:29.110">about post notifications and action center...talk about the ui updates first of all that</p>
      <p begin="00:29:29.110" end="00:29:33.410">are coming with those two technologies just like tiles</p>
      <p begin="00:29:33.410" end="00:29:37.310">action center and...have some principles that we tried to abide by</p>
      <p begin="00:29:37.310" end="00:29:42.000">very similarly toaster about glancing information you consume new information from your</p>
      <p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:46.760">app real difference between posts and tiles is that toaster interrupt of</p>
      <p begin="00:29:46.760" end="00:29:49.710">...still glanceable they're not a ton of information but they</p>
      <p begin="00:29:49.710" end="00:29:54.790">happened to come to the user when the user may not be looking at the stars additionally</p>
      <p begin="00:29:54.790" end="00:29:59.380">...are much more about actions they're much more about doing something to either launched</p>
      <p begin="00:29:59.380" end="00:30:00.790">app or taken action</p>
      <p begin="00:30:00.790" end="00:30:05.490">...app think is interesting I mean they by their nature they invite you to kind of create a complete</p>
      <p begin="00:30:05.490" end="00:30:09.060">...task because they are interrupted so,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:09.060" end="00:30:14.050">let's see a little bit of how that is actually going to work with a new action...windows ten across all</p>
      <p begin="00:30:14.050" end="00:30:19.290">of the different skews we have been moving to the same look and feel for the windows family you hopefully</p>
      <p begin="00:30:19.290" end="00:30:23.990">...notice that between the mobile builds and desktop builds action sensors are very similar</p>
      <p begin="00:30:23.990" end="00:30:28.390">we're trying to be very thoughtful of where you interact these things, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:28.390" end="00:30:33.030">you notice on the desktop that you can invoke action center from the task bar you can...from swiping to the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:33.030" end="00:30:37.500">...the right as well as a mobile you pull down from the top because we believe it makes sense</p>
      <p begin="00:30:37.500" end="00:30:42.050">to have different interaction model depending on device type that you're using optimized keyboard mouse</p>
      <p begin="00:30:42.050" end="00:30:47.650">versus optimized for touch in some cases most of the behaviors that exist and action center where to</p>
      <p begin="00:30:47.650" end="00:30:52.680">...inherited directly from windows phone the stuff that's new that I'll talk about and blue but,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:52.680" end="00:30:53.430">everything else</p>
      <p begin="00:30:53.430" end="00:30:58.420">is the behavior that started in the windows phone timeframe so toast automatically</p>
      <p begin="00:30:58.420" end="00:31:03.300">going to...center...existing windows app and you're using...notifications now after</p>
      <p begin="00:31:03.300" end="00:31:06.840">they...displaying on the screen they go directly into actions center and then they</p>
      <p begin="00:31:06.840" end="00:31:12.400">lived there until the user does something with them something new is that...can now be expanded to</p>
      <p begin="00:31:12.400" end="00:31:16.840">view...content and this is great because it actually helps existing developers if your</p>
      <p begin="00:31:16.840" end="00:31:20.180">phone developer today and use into...notification with a lot of content</p>
      <p begin="00:31:20.180" end="00:31:24.500">inside of it we only show the first-line essentially now you can send that same</p>
      <p begin="00:31:24.500" end="00:31:27.870">toast notification of windows ten device the user...pulled down the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:27.870" end="00:31:32.650">...and see a lot more content so you have to changer app for that if you're already doing that</p>
      <p begin="00:31:32.650" end="00:31:37.880">in sending a lot of content then you'll be able to just let the user get that new feature.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:37.880" end="00:31:42.370">The you cannot chase individual notifications...negotiates individual notifications</p>
      <p begin="00:31:42.370" end="00:31:46.600">...notification action center it launches the app whatever deep think that you had you</p>
      <p begin="00:31:46.600" end="00:31:51.260">can clear all your always able to do that on phone you can remove for apple group which means there's a header</p>
      <p begin="00:31:51.260" end="00:31:53.830">for your notifications...shows your app and</p>
      <p begin="00:31:53.830" end="00:31:58.780">swipe the entire group away but now you can remove as a user individual notification</p>
      <p begin="00:31:58.780" end="00:32:03.070">so if you've got five notifications from my app and I just my triage the first two I can do that and just</p>
      <p begin="00:32:03.070" end="00:32:08.660">wipe them away and then we also have the ability for alarms and reminders to the viewed inside of</p>
      <p begin="00:32:08.660" end="00:32:13.430">center now so if an alarm notification comes up I'm going to talk a little bit about the scenarios a</p>
      <p begin="00:32:13.430" end="00:32:19.170">...to do that a little bit you can actually show hideout notification and it will show up inside</p>
      <p begin="00:32:19.170" end="00:32:22.610">action center to take action on later if you want to ...some of the</p>
      <p begin="00:32:22.610" end="00:32:27.740">...to show you can just make it go away right away as a developers up to you.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:27.740" end="00:32:30.010">So, let's talk again about the basics of</p>
      <p begin="00:32:30.010" end="00:32:34.580">...notifications just like we did about the basics of tile modifications.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:34.580" end="00:32:39.200">First templates legacy templates are still there so there weren't quite as many</p>
      <p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:43.260">...temples...thousand-plus are only eight...templates they were kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:32:43.260" end="00:32:47.820">the same thing though the first for...templates work text and different layouts and other for</p>
      <p begin="00:32:47.820" end="00:32:51.700">...templates were images and different layouts so,...tell</p>
      <p begin="00:32:51.700" end="00:32:56.690">samples will still work there is some good news if you notice before and windows phone if you use</p>
      <p begin="00:32:56.690" end="00:33:01.610">them a toast template that had images and it wouldn't show the image it would work on</p>
      <p begin="00:33:01.610" end="00:33:05.710">desktop...just not be shown on phone now if you send that notification to</p>
      <p begin="00:33:05.710" end="00:33:10.360">phoned image will show up on windows ten device so there is some enhancements there will be able to use</p>
      <p begin="00:33:10.360" end="00:33:14.090">toasted images in the legacy payloads if you want to...images will show up</p>
      <p begin="00:33:14.090" end="00:33:19.000">...got that scenario but just like adaptive tiles were talking about adaptive</p>
      <p begin="00:33:19.000" end="00:33:23.930">toast today as well but it's not just adaptability of the content in the toaster going to talk about it's</p>
      <p begin="00:33:23.930" end="00:33:28.480">also interactivity so we have adaptive and interactive toast notifications</p>
      <p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:33.740">now and again the most flexible...template we ever had and there's only one template for</p>
      <p begin="00:33:33.740" end="00:33:37.500">...post generic that's it and you can do all the things I'm going to show you</p>
      <p begin="00:33:37.500" end="00:33:40.760">just that one template so for desktop</p>
      <p begin="00:33:40.760" end="00:33:44.840">and mobile going to show you a couple different examples I want to start with this first one of</p>
      <p begin="00:33:44.840" end="00:33:49.650">something like in qq you've gotten some new photos posted and there's to notify</p>
      <p begin="00:33:49.650" end="00:33:54.540">...showing to an application for desktop and mobile but they're really the same exact notification</p>
      <p begin="00:33:54.540" end="00:33:59.020">are...difference a little bit on desktop you'll see that there's no dragged to</p>
      <p begin="00:33:59.020" end="00:34:02.680">expand notification because on desktops we've got the room they all come out</p>
      <p begin="00:34:02.680" end="00:34:05.420">...expanded like this whereas on mobile users</p>
      <p begin="00:34:05.420" end="00:34:09.440">...notification down so they can see more information because we just don't have that much room</p>
      <p begin="00:34:09.440" end="00:34:15.430">on mobile here's another example of doing some interaction this is one we hope takes off we really think it will if</p>
      <p begin="00:34:15.430" end="00:34:20.000">you've used the flights that we've got for the phone build you've seen this today where you can do a quick</p>
      <p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:22.800">reply to a message for the sms messaging out</p>
      <p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:27.320">and we think a lot of apps are going to adopt this is one of the most powerful ways to the user interact with your</p>
      <p begin="00:34:27.320" end="00:34:33.610">app without them actually switching from what they're doing so in this case you can see we've got a quick apply message.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:33.610" end="00:34:37.750">And, then another example this could be something like sap if you wanted to have a</p>
      <p begin="00:34:37.750" end="00:34:42.850">couple quick buttons and you want to say ...actually for vacation...want accept or decline in my</p>
      <p begin="00:34:42.850" end="00:34:48.690">...a...somebody like andru asking for vacation and I would definitely decline it because they just...doesn't need any time</p>
      <p begin="00:34:50.200" end="00:34:54.200">So, this is some really simple examples but we're going to go on and talk about actually showing you some of these</p>
      <p begin="00:34:54.200" end="00:34:58.730">and a little bit and how you can create them on your own so introducing this stuff you can do with adaptive</p>
      <p begin="00:34:58.730" end="00:35:02.140">and interactive toasts so just like tiles the content</p>
      <p begin="00:35:02.140" end="00:35:07.270">...the toasts there's more room we show more...less room we show less?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:07.270" end="00:35:10.980">Here's an example ofbeing able to show more content is a really simple</p>
      <p begin="00:35:10.980" end="00:35:15.900">xml example of what I'd used in inline image so I've got an image here I've got a couple</p>
      <p begin="00:35:15.900" end="00:35:21.200">of lines of text and you'll notice just like in tiles for that image placement because inline</p>
      <p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:24.360">is for that larger image of the room but I've also</p>
      <p begin="00:35:24.360" end="00:35:27.750">replaced the app icon that would normally show up in the top</p>
      <p begin="00:35:27.750" end="00:35:32.600">left the toast with my own image and I did that using image placement equals apple logo</p>
      <p begin="00:35:32.600" end="00:35:37.500">overwrite towards the top so we're really trying to let you have as much flexibility with this area as</p>
      <p begin="00:35:37.500" end="00:35:41.440">we possibly can before things like that would only be the app icon now you can kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:35:41.440" end="00:35:44.210">...and do your own thing?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:44.210" end="00:35:49.670">Show another example of if you want to do something a little more complex of action this is a rendell of what</p>
      <p begin="00:35:49.670" end="00:35:54.670">...to do their using our adaptive templates as well so they've actually shown</p>
      <p begin="00:35:54.670" end="00:35:59.510">and image they've shown some text they shown a mapping here they've even got some selection boxes to</p>
      <p begin="00:35:59.510" end="00:36:02.760">let-you snooze this and then they've got snooze and dismiss buttons</p>
      <p begin="00:36:02.760" end="00:36:07.320">for what you want them to do with this notification and if you look we've got some things like activation</p>
      <p begin="00:36:07.320" end="00:36:12.320">types as well I'm going to talk a little more about the activation types and a little bit and,...</p>
      <p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:17.100">actually show you that is one of demos too and what it means to handle when these buttons are clicks and how you deal with</p>
      <p begin="00:36:17.100" end="00:36:23.220">...then I got one more quick example this is...example for highly do something like a quick</p>
      <p begin="00:36:23.220" end="00:36:27.400">reply notifications so you can see really I've done here is in the action section about</p>
      <p begin="00:36:27.400" end="00:36:31.940">...box that's as much as it really takes and, you can retrieve that input whenever</p>
      <p begin="00:36:31.940" end="00:36:36.710">...you can do whatever you want to do with it and we've actually got a real live working example that for you a</p>
      <p begin="00:36:36.710" end="00:36:43.290">little bit as well so three quick examples of what you can do with interactive notifications?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:43.290" end="00:36:48.120">I...talk about the states of tows as well just like I did tiles so I talk a little bit about</p>
      <p begin="00:36:48.120" end="00:36:53.060">already but the collapse state of a toasts is really what you see on mobile by default but</p>
      <p begin="00:36:53.060" end="00:36:57.630">whenever you go into actions center because we want to show you more stuff once the...moved off the screen</p>
      <p begin="00:36:57.630" end="00:37:02.040">...action center for the most part they're always collapsed and the user can expand them if they want</p>
      <p begin="00:37:02.040" end="00:37:07.340">...here's an example of them being collapsed in the phone action center this is the same policy we...a desktop</p>
      <p begin="00:37:07.340" end="00:37:12.090">action center because we want...show you more information about your notifications all together and</p>
      <p begin="00:37:12.090" end="00:37:16.210">they're so we by default collapse them all up here's one more example of a</p>
      <p begin="00:37:16.210" end="00:37:20.860">collapse notification before I've pulled down on those river to actually show more about</p>
      <p begin="00:37:20.860" end="00:37:25.720">the notification then I talked about the expanded state now the expanded state</p>
      <p begin="00:37:25.720" end="00:37:30.850">in this case...I've gone into actions...clicked on the notification the little down-arrow of</p>
      <p begin="00:37:30.850" end="00:37:35.560">expanded notification out and you can see that everything I can do with the notification when it came to my</p>
      <p begin="00:37:35.560" end="00:37:38.500">screen in the first-place I can do with it when it's action center they</p>
      <p begin="00:37:38.500" end="00:37:43.280">...collapse but nothing changes about the notification depending on where it's at it's always going to go</p>
      <p begin="00:37:43.280" end="00:37:48.190">to do all of its actions no matter where it ends up this is a similar example of a notification that's already</p>
      <p begin="00:37:48.190" end="00:37:53.160">pre expanded on desktop like I said because we have more room on desktop we automatically pretty</p>
      <p begin="00:37:53.160" end="00:37:56.170">expand some things.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:56.170" end="00:37:59.590">And, then I want to talk a little bit about scenarios that can let you decide to</p>
      <p begin="00:37:59.590" end="00:38:04.550">...expand notification as well so we do have scenarios for alarms now we think</p>
      <p begin="00:38:04.550" end="00:38:09.440">of everything as a notification now there's not a separate alarms or reminders namespaces all</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:11.620">...notification and the scenario is what</p>
      <p begin="00:38:11.620" end="00:38:15.600">decides the behavior of that notification so in this case</p>
      <p begin="00:38:15.600" end="00:38:20.040">there's a whole bunch more xml I would have here but for the most part this scenario equals alarm inside of that</p>
      <p begin="00:38:20.040" end="00:38:22.630">...is what actually tells me that I want this to be</p>
      <p begin="00:38:22.630" end="00:38:26.420">bree expanded because whenever you're alarms wake you up at, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:26.420" end="00:38:30.930">let's say some reason all-time like eight o'clock then you just want to quickly hits</p>
      <p begin="00:38:30.930" end="00:38:35.890">news for dismiss news in my case and not have to actually pull that notification down because</p>
      <p begin="00:38:35.890" end="00:38:39.610">it's an alarm type of notification we wanted to give developers...to say go ahead and</p>
      <p begin="00:38:39.610" end="00:38:44.360">...expands and something very similar applies for reminders again whenever</p>
      <p begin="00:38:44.360" end="00:38:48.060">...reminder to go home comes up...you want to be traffic you don't have to pull</p>
      <p begin="00:38:48.060" end="00:38:52.770">...down...to let you use this narrow reminder to actually pretty expand that notification</p>
      <p begin="00:38:52.770" end="00:38:56.180">so shows up as big as it should be for the user.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:56.180" end="00:38:59.360">We have one really interesting one we actually have an incoming call</p>
      <p begin="00:38:59.360" end="00:39:04.000">scenario as well and depending on the skew I don't have example for...this is an example for</p>
      <p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:08.950">phone you can actually have a full-screen notification that lets you do something like an incoming call</p>
      <p begin="00:39:08.950" end="00:39:13.300">...this case going to answer button a message button and ignore button and because calls</p>
      <p begin="00:39:13.300" end="00:39:17.950">...critical to the mobile experience we've decided to rendered full-screen on desktop we</p>
      <p begin="00:39:17.950" end="00:39:22.920">probably wouldn't...full-screen...might be bigger but it wouldn't take up your whole screen because it's not the primary function of the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:22.920" end="00:39:27.600">devices...using the take a call necessarily and you just again specify this with the scenario</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.600" end="00:39:31.100">...scenario equals incoming call so you can do some really powerful stuff with</p>
      <p begin="00:39:31.100" end="00:39:36.760">these scenarios to give your user the best experience with notifications.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:36.760" end="00:39:41.760">So, the launch types so all of those things as buttons that you saw that you do a different launch type</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.760" end="00:39:46.610">for your application and the most obvious one is a foreground activation just like you've always been able to tap on the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:46.610" end="00:39:50.160">toast itself to launch the app now you can tap on the button to launch the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:50.160" end="00:39:52.550">...so in the foreground activation</p>
      <p begin="00:39:52.550" end="00:39:57.390">...button the app launches...arguments that we passion to you...you do whatever</p>
      <p begin="00:39:57.390" end="00:40:03.940">makes sense to your at this is kind of the simplest most straightforward thing that we had from before and now...but.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:03.940" end="00:40:05.310">We have background activation</p>
      <p begin="00:40:05.310" end="00:40:10.090">as well so any of those buttons could actually invoke a background task and actually</p>
      <p begin="00:40:10.090" end="00:40:15.070">...that up to do some work for me in the case of doing something like a quick reply once the user interest in text and</p>
      <p begin="00:40:15.070" end="00:40:19.800">hits that send button you're really going to wake up your background task go communicate with your server...have</p>
      <p begin="00:40:19.800" end="00:40:24.700">your service and that message over to the next user so again you tap the button the task launches</p>
      <p begin="00:40:24.700" end="00:40:28.990">your...some arguments that we give you...give you the input id we give you what was actually in the box</p>
      <p begin="00:40:28.990" end="00:40:32.800">...give you all the stuff that the user touched on the toast and then you take actions on that</p>
      <p begin="00:40:32.800" end="00:40:36.090">...make sense figure out there's two more types I want to talk</p>
      <p begin="00:40:36.090" end="00:40:40.970">about this protocol activation as well this one's really important us were really,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:40.970" end="00:40:45.460">really invested in like having a web of apps on your device and protocols</p>
      <p begin="00:40:45.460" end="00:40:49.210">are perfect way to do that protocols are more than just something like http and</p>
      <p begin="00:40:49.210" end="00:40:51.890">there's everybody's old favorite has been there forever mail to,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:51.890" end="00:40:56.580">for example, you can do those you can also do...app communication this way I could launch the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:56.580" end="00:41:00.360">being maps app actually anders...show you that a little bit so you tampa</p>
      <p begin="00:41:00.360" end="00:41:05.340">button the protocol activates the system handles that and then whatever the activation was supposed to launch actually gets</p>
      <p begin="00:41:05.340" end="00:41:11.620">launched can be a web page be and app is a really great way to do...half or up to website scenarios.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:11.620" end="00:41:15.990">And, finally we have some system activation types so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:15.990" end="00:41:20.830">I showed you could have a dismiss button that would wake up a background task and then you would handle that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:20.830" end="00:41:25.190">dismissing your app or maybe I hits news...in your background task would reschedule</p>
      <p begin="00:41:25.190" end="00:41:30.040">notification for a little later on if you don't want to deal with that if you don't want to have to write the coding</p>
      <p begin="00:41:30.040" end="00:41:34.000">your background task to handle rescheduling notifications...the system do a</p>
      <p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:38.260">...as a couple of system activation types that really only apply to things like alarms</p>
      <p begin="00:41:38.260" end="00:41:43.260">...reminders for things like snooze and dismiss we don't rightly code you to stay system activation</p>
      <p begin="00:41:43.260" end="00:41:47.160">type equals alarm...reminder and then if you hit the user has this news button the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:47.160" end="00:41:54.560">shell is taking care of making sure that notification pop back up you don't have to handle that your background task.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:54.560" end="00:41:57.040">And, then there's one more thing I want to talk about before throat over to</p>
      <p begin="00:41:57.040" end="00:42:01.150">the demo post notification history change trigger this one is really great</p>
      <p begin="00:42:01.150" end="00:42:05.360">features so this trigger just like a lot of triggers in the system has a certain time</p>
      <p begin="00:42:05.360" end="00:42:09.330">...fires and for us...is whenever...notification for your app</p>
      <p begin="00:42:09.330" end="00:42:14.470">and action sensor has changed if I go into...on a swiping notification away</p>
      <p begin="00:42:14.470" end="00:42:18.890">will launch this trigger which will...your background task and you can do whatever you want with that background</p>
      <p begin="00:42:18.890" end="00:42:24.090">tasks a lot of people use this so that they can keep their tyler badge and saying</p>
      <p begin="00:42:24.090" end="00:42:29.350">and I'm going to show you that...some people might use it to talk back to their cloud server as a matter-of-fact a good</p>
      <p begin="00:42:29.350" end="00:42:33.550">use for this is if I've got the same app across multiple devices...I...all of</p>
      <p begin="00:42:33.550" end="00:42:36.590">...devices and saying we got feedback and developers that</p>
      <p begin="00:42:36.590" end="00:42:41.430">...they want to wait actually be able to achieve this so you use...history</p>
      <p begin="00:42:41.430" end="00:42:46.720">change trigger whenever one notification get dismiss from my mobile device I could talk my cloud</p>
      <p begin="00:42:46.720" end="00:42:51.450">...delete for that same notification with that same tagging group on another device and this</p>
      <p begin="00:42:51.450" end="00:42:55.860">way you're in control of getting your notifications and...if you want so how do you</p>
      <p begin="00:42:55.860" end="00:43:01.660">how do you do this well I'm not going to talk about it the better...could just show you so take it away.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:01.660" end="00:43:07.920">...so, we're going to start off by creating a toast notification here.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:07.920" end="00:43:12.830">So, here we're just constructing the...notification payload as you can see you put in your tile</p>
      <p begin="00:43:12.830" end="00:43:16.860">and content in the adaptive part of it and then the cool stuff is the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:16.860" end="00:43:21.740">actions down here so these are buttons those...text fields and those select</p>
      <p begin="00:43:21.740" end="00:43:26.470">lists and as you can see you can do with those protocol activation like this one</p>
      <p begin="00:43:26.470" end="00:43:31.300">launches being maps when we click this button you can much websites and you can launch</p>
      <p begin="00:43:31.300" end="00:43:35.880">email clients and also background tasks and other things that</p>
      <p begin="00:43:35.880" end="00:43:38.720">...talked about so we're going to issue that</p>
      <p begin="00:43:38.720" end="00:43:43.120">...notification here in our...so here's the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:43.120" end="00:43:47.570">...notification if I click near me are have semi...will show me hip</p>
      <p begin="00:43:47.570" end="00:43:51.530">...that are near me by launching being maps and doing research for hip</p>
      <p begin="00:43:51.530" end="00:43:54.320">...what find...economy's right</p>
      <p begin="00:43:54.320" end="00:43:58.160">here that it's definitely a bug and then.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:00.240" end="00:44:06.220">The things you can do you can launch wikipedia and find out about...</p>
      <p begin="00:44:06.220" end="00:44:09.960">And, then you can also remove notifications as</p>
      <p begin="00:44:09.960" end="00:44:14.930">thomas talked about so if we papa few notifications here.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:14.930" end="00:44:18.950">And, we'll set a different tag for the second notification and now</p>
      <p begin="00:44:18.950" end="00:44:22.980">have to notifications and here and you can pragmatically remove</p>
      <p begin="00:44:22.980" end="00:44:24.440">...so we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:44:24.440" end="00:44:28.970">remove that top one by specifying the tag and we programmatic</p>
      <p begin="00:44:28.970" end="00:44:32.430">...remove that is gone and you also have that</p>
      <p begin="00:44:32.430" end="00:44:36.600">toast notification change trigger so if we look at our lives out here it knows we</p>
      <p begin="00:44:36.600" end="00:44:40.990">have one notification in action center-right now if we go and</p>
      <p begin="00:44:40.990" end="00:44:44.230">swipe that away we fire a background task and update</p>
      <p begin="00:44:44.230" end="00:44:47.280">...tile...notifications so you can keep everything in</p>
      <p begin="00:44:47.280" end="00:44:53.100">sync and provide a really good experience for your users.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:53.100" end="00:44:58.690">Okay, I think that's cool but quake...quick reply is cool so</p>
      <p begin="00:44:58.690" end="00:45:03.130">with quick reply we have a website here which finds out like what</p>
      <p begin="00:45:03.130" end="00:45:07.870">...say and I just refresh it show you this is actually like live-in everything's running</p>
      <p begin="00:45:07.870" end="00:45:12.160">on local host but otherwise it's alive and if we go to</p>
      <p begin="00:45:12.160" end="00:45:16.680">our let's check out the code first basically we're going to issue a quick</p>
      <p begin="00:45:16.680" end="00:45:21.550">reply notification and we're going to run this background task and in the background</p>
      <p begin="00:45:21.550" end="00:45:26.320">task we take these...that we actually provide in</p>
      <p begin="00:45:26.320" end="00:45:30.840">...notification and we pull out the message that user types and we send that to</p>
      <p begin="00:45:30.840" end="00:45:34.060">our web server here and we just do http post</p>
      <p begin="00:45:34.060" end="00:45:39.020">there so if we go back to our app we can send a</p>
      <p begin="00:45:39.020" end="00:45:43.060">...for a quick reply and as you see it comes up here you can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:45:43.060" end="00:45:47.820">...those in your action centered seo expand it and what</p>
      <p begin="00:45:47.820" end="00:45:52.190">...hips or say well pbr...grab...and that triggered</p>
      <p begin="00:45:52.190" end="00:45:57.270">our backgrounds task...if we go back to the website we can refresh and</p>
      <p begin="00:45:57.270" end="00:46:01.040">see that you actually posted it from a background task?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:04.560">Pretty cool stuff there and finally</p>
      <p begin="00:46:04.560" end="00:46:09.990">thomas talked about scenarios for toasts this is another...payload here</p>
      <p begin="00:46:09.990" end="00:46:14.490">and as you can see we have scenario alarm so in that appears if we</p>
      <p begin="00:46:14.490" end="00:46:22.170">had audio working in the audio not working so audio and startling...</p>
      <p begin="00:46:22.170" end="00:46:26.420">And, you can have the selection less there and here you can actually trigger background</p>
      <p begin="00:46:26.420" end="00:46:31.190">tasks so our background task would go and trigger that notifications be</p>
      <p begin="00:46:31.190" end="00:46:35.300">schedule ten minutes later back to...school thanks</p>
      <p begin="00:46:35.300" end="00:46:41.560">...so we're almost the end that's most of what we've come to talk about today</p>
      <p begin="00:46:41.560" end="00:46:46.510">...to recap windows dot you item notifications is where you get everything for tells</p>
      <p begin="00:46:46.510" end="00:46:48.100">...what was there from</p>
      <p begin="00:46:48.100" end="00:46:53.790">...still there today is your guys...you go used to do everything you need to.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:53.790" end="00:46:58.460">And, I didn't talk much about push I talked a little bit about it but I just want to have it up here windows</p>
      <p begin="00:46:58.460" end="00:47:01.410">...notifications all still there also exists great</p>
      <p begin="00:47:02.420" end="00:47:06.580">...notifications and badges still...works great.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:06.580" end="00:47:10.430">And, then one more thing I wanted to announce in the spirit of you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:10.430" end="00:47:14.410">kind of more exclusivity of this conference I feel like our sell team that a really,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:14.410" end="00:47:17.480">really amazing thing they went and made it possible</p>
      <p begin="00:47:17.480" end="00:47:25.930">...thirty-two...to do adaptive...interactive this means.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:25.930" end="00:47:31.050">This means classic windows apps...before project centennial this is right now and do</p>
      <p begin="00:47:31.050" end="00:47:34.110">...essentially comic activation to bring their app up whenever</p>
      <p begin="00:47:34.110" end="00:47:38.270">and interactive notification...now I don't have...time to...today</p>
      <p begin="00:47:38.270" end="00:47:42.660">is a little bit complex but it works really well and we're going to have a sample upon msdn so</p>
      <p begin="00:47:42.660" end="00:47:50.120">that people can use it and, I just, you know, I love to its for an awesome we actually used in the keynote them or?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:50.120" end="00:47:53.940">Little bit of a recap so you said you want windows apps we hope we brought</p>
      <p begin="00:47:53.940" end="00:47:58.190">you windows apps you said you want...ui updates you are refreshing</p>
      <p begin="00:47:58.190" end="00:48:02.850">...everywhere now you see coming together notification central okay we did you action</p>
      <p begin="00:48:02.850" end="00:48:06.690">...and windows we gave you adaptive thousand toasts instead of a</p>
      <p begin="00:48:06.690" end="00:48:13.330">new template catalog and then finally more powerful notifications through interactive.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:13.330" end="00:48:18.440">So, really enjoyed having...today...way to see what you do that we'll be putting the sample up</p>
      <p begin="00:48:18.440" end="00:48:23.360">on msdn code gallagher possibly get bob will be putting the template visualize are up as well we hope</p>
      <p begin="00:48:23.360" end="00:48:28.100">the community can contribute to...to do some awesome stuff or some examples of going to be fully open-source the temple</p>
      <p begin="00:48:28.100" end="00:48:37.140">...you guys are going to go to see whatever you want with it and, just...great stuff we appreciate...</p>
      <p begin="00:48:39.100" end="00:48:42.940">About ten minutes for questions so the microphone but.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:43.980" end="00:48:47.800">Quick one so any plans on allowing any kind of sv deers</p>
      <p begin="00:48:47.800" end="00:48:53.120">ammo based icons for those assets that we don't have to have like fifteen...</p>
      <p begin="00:48:53.120" end="00:48:58.610">and resize them eighteen different ways okay so the question was can you give me something like</p>
      <p begin="00:48:58.610" end="00:49:01.500">...high-profile so that I can or is even</p>
      <p begin="00:49:01.500" end="00:49:07.440">...and the question is not you are the answers not is not quite yet but yes we realize that, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:07.440" end="00:49:11.360">something...that scale better is also a great addition to the software we just don't have</p>
      <p begin="00:49:11.360" end="00:49:15.650">available for yet but, you know, what if you just keep giving the feedback...know hopefully</p>
      <p begin="00:49:15.650" end="00:49:20.610">will go for you what we'd like to think...we're trying to do so it's really the only place we can't do it right you have</p>
      <p begin="00:49:20.610" end="00:49:28.010">everywhere else in the app we can example...for everything, yeah, I totally agree from work?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:28.010" end="00:49:31.870">With live tiles you have to set the ...color in the manifests is there anyway we</p>
      <p begin="00:49:31.870" end="00:49:36.480">can have it...update to push a new background</p>
      <p begin="00:49:36.480" end="00:49:38.860">colors to the live tiles.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38.860" end="00:49:42.010">The question was can-you pushed update the background color and it's really</p>
      <p begin="00:49:42.010" end="00:49:46.050">...the closest...go to calmness...image and as the background</p>
      <p begin="00:49:46.050" end="00:49:52.890">...a color and that roughly...same effect but you can't do it as part of it's not really part.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:52.890" end="00:50:00.100">Fix-up imap method.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:00.100" end="00:50:01.410">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:01.410" end="00:50:03.630">So, the tiles are great for having</p>
      <p begin="00:50:03.630" end="00:50:12.050">user be able to watch monitors something in the background.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:12.050" end="00:50:16.220">Tn when are we going to be able to allow them to put one on the desktop so they can</p>
      <p begin="00:50:16.220" end="00:50:21.180">logic continuously okay so you're saying...wire my...available...desktop not just start</p>
      <p begin="00:50:21.180" end="00:50:24.510">...fantastically the feedback as well I will absolutely talk to the</p>
      <p begin="00:50:24.510" end="00:50:29.100">...about it I actually think that they did some exploration of it I'm not sure what their plans</p>
      <p begin="00:50:29.100" end="00:50:39.840">are but where they have to find out you should...me...and...question.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:39.840" end="00:50:43.350">Samoa.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:43.350" end="00:50:47.300">...anybody else now.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:47.300" end="00:50:55.760">Okay, go ahead you can see...</p>
      <p begin="00:51:09.670" end="00:51:19.470">On sports.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:19.470" end="00:51:22.210">So, the question really about restrictions of launching a background</p>
