      <p begin="00:25:36.500" end="00:25:41.700">And, localize in the ui of the app itself and the metadata listing in the store it's architect</p>
      <p begin="00:25:41.700" end="00:25:46.560">in your solution such that it modular you can quickly swap a new language</p>
      <p begin="00:25:46.560" end="00:25:52.130">...without having to rewrite the code with their part piloting and build was to customers office at</p>

      <p begin="00:25:54.120" end="00:25:58.420">...crm and they actually localized for them and up to eleven languages</p>

      <p begin="00:27:30.260" end="00:27:33.850">Statistic along...expected okay, and,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:33.850" end="00:27:37.640">then it...a little bit of a lag time before shows up so...this</p>
      <p begin="00:27:37.640" end="00:27:42.570">explain when you have your third-party solution showing up in the app launcher three sixty five again</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42.570" end="00:27:47.300">we're fifty million people do the work every day the first party stuff will be above-the-line</p>

      <p begin="00:27:50.410" end="00:27:53.060">and what users can do is they can selectively say,</p>

      <p begin="00:27:58.050" end="00:28:02.900">falafel so you have kind of a larger pool of stuff down here and then you can pin them</p>
      <p begin="00:28:02.900" end="00:28:05.060">...at one level up so you can quickly</p>
      <p begin="00:28:05.060" end="00:28:11.890">launch them so let's hit refresh and see if it shows up yet?</p>

      <p begin="00:28:35.100" end="00:28:39.600">ad does they keep saying happy need to say actually this is...three sixty five level so this is actually</p>
      <p begin="00:28:39.600" end="00:28:44.570">...what this solution does is it is to create</p>
      <p begin="00:28:44.570" end="00:28:48.540">and out of office auto respond but it doesn't in multiple languages this is where line bridge came</p>

      <p begin="00:36:45.490" end="00:36:49.860">So, let's do a demo that.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:49.860" end="00:36:54.210">So, let's see I'm going to go to the store and.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:54.210" end="00:36:59.560">Then I'll switch over.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:59.560" end="00:37:04.860">Okay, so,...I am on the store now.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:04.860" end="00:37:07.860">And, hello, how about that is a banner for the apple words on the homepage of</p>

      <p begin="00:37:13.470" end="00:37:16.390">And, I'm I heard it's really pool sample code the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:16.390" end="00:37:21.380">helps me a monetize my customers and it's called the...so.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:21.380" end="00:37:24.390">...so I look for can...so.</p>

      <p begin="00:37:27.880" end="00:37:32.950">...because hidden behind this thing called office preview so I happen to know</p>
      <p begin="00:37:32.950" end="00:37:36.230">what the code is which is code build fifteen.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:36.230" end="00:37:37.710">...click that and boom</p>
      <p begin="00:37:37.710" end="00:37:42.000">well are there is the sample code that only developer who is part of the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:46.010">programme has been told look for here can get in the nice thing is...in</p>
      <p begin="00:37:46.010" end="00:37:50.930">the store as opposed to outing get hub all the licensing tooling is already installs</p>
      <p begin="00:37:50.930" end="00:37:55.740">you don't have to get a sample license you'll have to wired up to use...your own id</p>
      <p begin="00:37:55.740" end="00:38:02.640">...use the story engine which is kind of a nice thing saves time makes it more simple.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:05.100">So, here's an additional innovation used to be when you</p>
      <p begin="00:38:05.100" end="00:38:08.720">install sharepoint and in the outlook apps or</p>
      <p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:13.250">...I should say you had to know what site to install to ziad...go to your sharepoint site</p>
      <p begin="00:38:13.250" end="00:38:17.420">...around and look for it and then say okay this is where I want to stick it in now</p>
      <p begin="00:38:17.420" end="00:38:21.740">...they've created a sharepoint site picker...within the store acquisition</p>
      <p begin="00:38:21.740" end="00:38:25.390">flow so you click ok on acquire the sharepoint this will be</p>
      <p begin="00:38:25.390" end="00:38:30.440">too not just for samples solution this will be true for sharepoint solutions in general commercial</p>
      <p begin="00:38:30.440" end="00:38:34.670">go-to market products in the store and I can pick the site that I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:38:34.670" end="00:38:37.450">install a to write within the flow don't have to go anywhere</p>
      <p begin="00:38:37.450" end="00:38:42.830">...continue it gives me a by or try I'm...try it to</p>
      <p begin="00:38:42.830" end="00:38:47.120">...kind of the whole point it says well I'm not sure you have the right to this what's</p>
      <p begin="00:38:47.120" end="00:38:50.270">echoed again so I put that...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50.270" end="00:38:55.340">If I could type.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:55.340" end="00:38:59.000">Right so there's the code.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:59.000" end="00:39:04.840">It's now...</p>
      <p begin="00:39:04.840" end="00:39:09.670">Ok, and, now it's install to my team site which is a site I picked in the site picker there</p>
      <p begin="00:39:09.670" end="00:39:15.110">...it's my most recently installed solution and here is the landing</p>
      <p begin="00:39:15.110" end="00:39:17.190">I hope, yeah, here's landing page for</p>
      <p begin="00:39:17.190" end="00:39:21.380">...this is the sample code solution now again if you're installing</p>
      <p begin="00:39:21.380" end="00:39:26.230">the sincere id from get hub which is fine networks to you have to mess around with a</p>
      <p begin="00:39:26.230" end="00:39:30.540">test license we can skip that step here and go right into trying out the sample at</p>
      <p begin="00:39:30.540" end="00:39:32.700">the point is this is a terrible</p>
      <p begin="00:39:32.700" end="00:39:37.120">ava doesn't really do anything it's vapor where the point is so it lights up functionality</p>
      <p begin="00:39:37.120" end="00:39:41.560">and copy and paste into your solutions that's the whole point of this thing so if you see here</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.560" end="00:39:44.140">agree to with hey this is a trial</p>
      <p begin="00:39:44.140" end="00:39:49.490">...probably some cripple functionality you may have to reveal some personal information and</p>
      <p begin="00:39:49.490" end="00:39:54.160">it's only demo data so it's basically setting up to understand so that's an example of something you can do</p>
      <p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:39:58.880">in the first thing that happens when you start this is now you've done the consent you've</p>

      <p begin="00:40:00.570" end="00:40:06.150">your now serving up your code if it's a provider hosted now.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:06.150" end="00:40:11.100">It says hey I want to know a little bit about you...pops in your ...form in</p>
      <p begin="00:40:11.100" end="00:40:16.060">a lets you enter some personal information which is both good for you because,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:16.060" end="00:40:19.640">you know, have some demographic data about the people who are trying out your solution</p>
      <p begin="00:40:19.640" end="00:40:23.020">it's good for the user because you can tailor the demo or</p>
      <p begin="00:40:23.020" end="00:40:28.550">teller the trial to the business...or whatever kind of other, you know, metric you want to you want</p>
      <p begin="00:40:28.550" end="00:40:34.080">...a segment by it can also populate this with sample data then it pops</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.080" end="00:40:39.060">a form saying I like your email address please and you can make that a required thing like some of our</p>
      <p begin="00:40:39.060" end="00:40:44.070">isv a partners actually do we can make optional so here it's optional so you</p>
      <p begin="00:40:44.070" end="00:40:49.020">could skip it but you say very nicely if you give us your email address we're going</p>
      <p begin="00:40:49.020" end="00:40:53.310">to send you a newsletter going to help you...tips and tricks you...the pot a bit</p>
      <p begin="00:40:53.310" end="00:40:58.280">by telling the user if you give me a little bit information about yourself I will help you through this trial</p>
      <p begin="00:40:58.280" end="00:41:03.190">say okay I'll do that...going to make a...address for now?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03.190" end="00:41:06.860">You can have enforcement of course on your and.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:06.860" end="00:41:10.220">And, the first thing it does when I consent to the giving my email addresses a</p>
      <p begin="00:41:10.220" end="00:41:14.640">pops a video so it basically says welcome to my trial here's how this</p>
      <p begin="00:41:14.640" end="00:41:19.430">whole thing works so I'm going to skip it for now.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:19.430" end="00:41:23.400">There is actually...video and now I'm in the actual experience if you look closely</p>
      <p begin="00:41:23.400" end="00:41:28.840">it says things like outpatient follow-up in...because I remember I said I</p>
      <p begin="00:41:28.840" end="00:41:33.290">was a member the medical community so it's showing these scenarios are familiar to me because</p>
      <p begin="00:41:33.290" end="00:41:37.480">...particular allies a demo to who I am base of what I told during the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:37.480" end="00:41:42.160">sign up and I'm going to create a couple of calendar events so I'm going to say I'm a I'm a surgeon</p>

      <p begin="00:41:57.560" end="00:42:01.310">calendar events but here's what happens I've done two things in this</p>
      <p begin="00:42:01.310" end="00:42:05.540">in this sample and now pops little toast and it says hey</p>
      <p begin="00:42:05.540" end="00:42:10.510">...been using this for a little while what you think and this is brilliant for two reasons number one</p>
      <p begin="00:42:10.510" end="00:42:14.540">...start engaging them and conversation but even more importantly if</p>
      <p begin="00:42:14.540" end="00:42:19.380">...noise and they're not happy what happens is they will click the button</p>
      <p begin="00:42:19.380" end="00:42:23.260">...away but if they will click that by...pop...form.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:23.260" end="00:42:28.090">And, if they if they click it right away...send the response to the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:28.090" end="00:42:32.580">eyes feed directly such that they don't enter and angry or crabby</p>
      <p begin="00:42:32.580" end="00:42:37.240">review so your bleed off the negative feedback and you send</p>
      <p begin="00:42:37.240" end="00:42:41.030">...yourself and you wait for them to use it for a while you essentially have a sort</p>
      <p begin="00:42:41.030" end="00:42:46.370">...a customer support engagement and only then later do they submit the review so up here what they want</p>
      <p begin="00:42:46.370" end="00:42:49.210">...review they can take some right into the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:49.210" end="00:42:54.680">review engine in the store if they want to buy who we stop them from</p>
      <p begin="00:42:54.680" end="00:43:01.140">buying during the trial that's not a bad thing so it takes a right back to the purchase page.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:01.140" end="00:43:03.010">If they want to learn more about it again you</p>
      <p begin="00:43:03.010" end="00:43:06.800">have a particular video that's even context based</p>
      <p begin="00:43:06.800" end="00:43:11.450">if they say well who else is part this thing what do they think well maybe you have.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:11.450" end="00:43:16.010">A story-telling video you want to linked to so again it's a way of engaging the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:16.010" end="00:43:24.250">user to assure them that there's all sorts of goodness they can...out somebody's windows.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:24.250" end="00:43:28.330">By trying...sample and then of course the features of</p>
      <p begin="00:43:28.330" end="00:43:32.350">the solution itself so, for example, contacts well this is a this is</p>
      <p begin="00:43:32.350" end="00:43:36.710">...employment schedules you need to have some context stored here explains how the contact</p>
      <p begin="00:43:36.710" end="00:43:41.470">thing work contact thing works but it also notices notes you only get up to ten</p>
      <p begin="00:43:41.470" end="00:43:45.930">clients for free if you want more than that you have to upgrade so essentially you</p>
      <p begin="00:43:45.930" end="00:43:50.970">tease them with some functionality but then you also say if you really love this feature</p>
      <p begin="00:43:50.970" end="00:43:55.790">here's a way for your by the full solution then some you just say flat out,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:55.790" end="00:43:59.470">you know, what this is a premium feature you have to upgrade to get this feature what</p>
      <p begin="00:43:59.470" end="00:44:02.270">you expose it so that...really pulled</p>
      <p begin="00:44:02.270" end="00:44:06.470">in...wants to engage and all this stuff maybe like I know this I do</p>
      <p begin="00:44:06.470" end="00:44:10.510">this is fine many people starting out in this build once</p>
      <p begin="00:44:10.510" end="00:44:15.500">in-cell many don't have this...market mentality...used to doing custom engagements statements</p>
      <p begin="00:44:15.500" end="00:44:19.870">...work you pay you transfer the ip here you're trying to build a solution that you</p>
      <p begin="00:44:19.870" end="00:44:23.500">get people just far enough down the path that they want to</p>
      <p begin="00:44:23.500" end="00:44:27.150">buy and then you begin to learn because you have this engaging with</p>
      <p begin="00:44:27.150" end="00:44:31.880">you make you get smarter about what works and what doesn't so the trial itself is like</p>
      <p begin="00:44:31.880" end="00:44:35.830">...test launch in makes you a smarter marketer so that's the</p>
      <p begin="00:44:35.830" end="00:44:42.270">that's the scheduler and the star preview to things I'm showing their?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:43.290" end="00:44:50.250">The last thing on trial is.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:50.250" end="00:44:54.430">Is simpler store a acquisition and...already saw that with sharepoint with</p>
      <p begin="00:44:54.430" end="00:44:59.830">the site picker there's also the same functionality as we'll see in just a second with</p>
      <p begin="00:44:59.830" end="00:45:04.750">...and it's...we should've been doing that all along fair enough we are</p>
      <p begin="00:45:04.750" end="00:45:09.690">phili doing it but the key point is now that we have the streamline acquisition flow for</p>
      <p begin="00:45:09.690" end="00:45:13.950">server base solutions it makes much more sense to begin to drive people</p>
      <p begin="00:45:13.950" end="00:45:17.750">to the store through things like banner ads and</p>
      <p begin="00:45:17.750" end="00:45:21.450">linkedin or just a button on your home page of your of your</p>
      <p begin="00:45:21.450" end="00:45:26.230">website say click here to download the solution they can go in there on authenticated</p>
      <p begin="00:45:26.230" end="00:45:28.540">...not immediately said go over there and sign in</p>
      <p begin="00:45:28.540" end="00:45:37.090">...go figure out where to install it you can do all that right through the flow of the store?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:37.090" end="00:45:44.440">Thing here here's a demo going to do this right within the body of the powerpoint.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.440" end="00:45:46.610">Do over here?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:46.610" end="00:45:50.730">Yeah, so, this is just a button which you can acquire from us</p>
      <p begin="00:45:50.730" end="00:45:52.870">to all brand approved by</p>
      <p begin="00:45:52.870" end="00:45:59.360">our legal folks if you want to localize let us know we can get a localized and,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:59.360" end="00:46:04.290">essentially it takes...right to the unsightly listing in the store one thing on a point out is we now have</p>
      <p begin="00:46:04.290" end="00:46:07.340">imbedded video that wasn't something we had before we only have links out</p>
      <p begin="00:46:07.340" end="00:46:12.540">...video so through an experiment we discovered definitely videos imbedded drives a lot more</p>
      <p begin="00:46:12.540" end="00:46:16.460">engagement that's something that unsightly is added and then I go to install.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:17.470" end="00:46:20.960">And, you can see right here it's taking me to my outlook web</p>
      <p begin="00:46:20.960" end="00:46:25.390">solution outlook web app directly it's not again making me go find it</p>
      <p begin="00:46:25.390" end="00:47:06.560">and install it there so I click it oops...sign-in.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:06.560" end="00:47:11.910">Ok, let's hope this works.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:11.910" end="00:47:16.220">Because some of these things are...preview it's temperamental cookies expiring...have to renew</p>
      <p begin="00:47:16.220" end="00:47:18.070">...that's what happens.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:18.070" end="00:47:23.820">In production that should be the case.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:23.820" end="00:47:33.280">Ok, so, there's the installation there's a consent.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:33.280" end="00:47:39.790">Ok, and, now it's added that solution...have to switch back.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:39.790" end="00:47:42.740">To my tendency.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:42.740" end="00:47:45.420">And, I can see right here if I click on</p>
      <p begin="00:47:45.420" end="00:47:49.900">...there's my unsightly waiting for me to</p>
      <p begin="00:47:49.900" end="00:47:51.810">...pull in a contact I don't actually have my</p>
      <p begin="00:47:51.810" end="00:47:56.260">in slightly account is concurrent but if it were would look for context in the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:56.260" end="00:48:01.600">...email...pull those contact right into my serum solution to the point is whether</p>
      <p begin="00:48:01.600" end="00:48:05.910">it sharepoint or just the word regular word excel powerpoint or it's or</p>
      <p begin="00:48:05.910" end="00:48:10.000">it's a outlook any of our solutions now make sense</p>
      <p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:21.800">to begin putting some of these buttons right within your.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:21.800" end="00:48:27.280">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:27.280" end="00:48:31.380">Like okay, yeah, so, it's...</p>
      <p begin="00:48:31.380" end="00:48:40.230">we definitely recommend you put the store button within your experience within your website.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:40.230" end="00:48:43.240">Okay, trial futures one last thing I'm going to move on to the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:43.240" end="00:48:47.860">final phase and that is streamline reviews we know the reviews definitely driving</p>
      <p begin="00:48:47.860" end="00:48:51.250">...known wants to click on a solution</p>
      <p begin="00:48:51.250" end="00:48:55.140">...store that has zero reviews it's been in the store for three years clearly that's kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:48:55.140" end="00:48:59.700">...a lonely place so we realize we weren't really optimizing the number of</p>
      <p begin="00:48:59.700" end="00:49:04.100">reviews we're getting we so-if...reviews in the spain site and the french site</p>
      <p begin="00:49:04.100" end="00:49:08.890">we weren't aggregating the number of numerical ratings that's no longer true...aggregate the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:08.890" end="00:49:13.770">number the most importantly,... longer have to actually answer of written review to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:13.770" end="00:49:19.740">and-or...drag across a number of stars and, hid go and that will register as a...</p>
      <p begin="00:49:19.740" end="00:49:24.730">ratings become much more common in the store and we're putting the reviews the very top of the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:24.730" end="00:49:30.130">listings so that people see reviews high up on the page so that's also coming.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:30.130" end="00:49:32.960">Trial call-to-action get that direct link to your</p>
      <p begin="00:49:32.960" end="00:49:38.210">attitudes and use best practices sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38.210" end="00:49:40.830">The...is engagement.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:40.830" end="00:49:43.830">And, just we have three quick things were going to show and I'll pretty much</p>
      <p begin="00:49:43.830" end="00:49:50.430">takes to the finish line the first thing is our drip email campaign I don't know-how many of you</p>
      <p begin="00:49:50.430" end="00:49:52.450">...is anyone sign up for the developer program.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:53.530" end="00:49:53.800">Guess</p>
      <p begin="00:49:53.800" end="00:49:58.650">...I've got a few definitely encourage you to do that one of the benefits you get for signing up</p>
      <p begin="00:49:58.650" end="00:50:01.670">is if you don't have an in inhouse outbound</p>
      <p begin="00:50:01.670" end="00:50:05.750">email campaign like more caddo or mail chimps these.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:05.750" end="00:50:10.080">Guys...small nimble...it's a pretty terrific solution very super</p>
      <p begin="00:50:10.080" end="00:50:13.000">easy-to-use that pretty robust we have</p>
      <p begin="00:50:13.000" end="00:50:18.000">partner with them to provide a free one-year subscription to the drip account and what it</p>
      <p begin="00:50:18.000" end="00:50:22.040">...creates automatic outbound emails...remember all those emails</p>
      <p begin="00:50:22.040" end="00:50:26.580">...harvesting in the sample...that code you can stick in your own solution then you can</p>
      <p begin="00:50:26.580" end="00:50:31.350">...those emails into something like drip and you can schedule outbound emails on</p>
      <p begin="00:50:31.350" end="00:50:36.320">day one three five-thirty to say hey welcome how you how's it going</p>
      <p begin="00:50:36.320" end="00:50:42.770">what do you think and then towards the end of the trial if it is a trial you can say peats</p>
      <p begin="00:50:42.770" end="00:50:47.780">...buy if it's free you can also check to see if they've used in the last week or month</p>
      <p begin="00:50:47.780" end="00:50:52.850">...pokemon say we've noticed you haven't been using it for a while why not so,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:52.850" end="00:50:57.840">if the marriage of the sample code in the best practices solution</p>
      <p begin="00:50:57.840" end="00:51:02.420">with drip really now gets you a true go-to market engine for</p>
      <p begin="00:51:02.420" end="00:51:15.050">...people and it's very simply can is...in javascript snippets we're going to a very quick demo here?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:15.050" end="00:51:17.750">Okay, so.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:17.750" end="00:51:21.050">This is were halfway down the drip dashboard online create a brand new campaign.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:22.080" end="00:51:24.310">...trial account I have...into call</p>
      <p begin="00:51:24.310" end="00:51:29.000">...something and what this campaign is targeting is a particular website so-if you have a</p>
      <p begin="00:51:29.000" end="00:51:32.570">nap on a website hosted on a website or just your home page of your actual</p>
      <p begin="00:51:32.570" end="00:51:40.830">with isv website you targeted here so it's going to call it chien app dot</p>
      <p begin="00:51:40.830" end="00:51:45.850">com...something up now course later downstream you'll have to actually</p>
      <p begin="00:51:45.850" end="00:51:50.740">tie it but we're not going to do that and you can either have a campaign</p>
      <p begin="00:51:50.740" end="00:51:56.150">that harvest...or I'm sorry harvest user activity if we're going just your website in driving by</p>
      <p begin="00:51:56.150" end="00:52:01.780">...engaging...trial we're going to do this...this is most like the trial for a solution...</p>
      <p begin="00:52:01.780" end="00:52:07.880">and absolution we don't have any of these e-commerce engines yes we have a trial for this</p>
      <p begin="00:52:08.930" end="00:52:11.860">...now pretty much configured it the only two steps left really</p>
      <p begin="00:52:11.860" end="00:52:15.970">...three steps drip millions are busy you all you have to do is</p>
      <p begin="00:52:15.970" end="00:52:19.180">install this javascript snippet?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:19.180" end="00:52:24.480">Into each page of your solution in that way it captures people coming in a captors</p>
      <p begin="00:52:24.480" end="00:52:30.480">...behaviors you can do analytics later right on the drip account and then here we would have to check for the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:30.480" end="00:52:34.690">code to make sure the snippet is...in the website but since I haven't done that in the interest</p>
      <p begin="00:52:34.690" end="00:52:41.030">of time I'm going to finish the demo whoops didn't start a new powerpoint.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:41.030" end="00:52:44.520">...the and go back.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:44.520" end="00:52:50.090">To my slide where.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:50.090" end="00:52:55.360">In finish the demo there.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:55.360" end="00:53:00.670">So, after you install the snippet to capture analytics you then install some api</p>
      <p begin="00:53:00.670" end="00:53:05.630">hooks you can either again just be a simple as a javascript copy and paste there is also</p>
      <p begin="00:53:05.630" end="00:53:10.620">arrest api...asp dot net api there's one other the wrappers well that was</p>
      <p begin="00:53:10.620" end="00:53:15.150">...and build...is downstairs least has been the first two days from drip</p>
      <p begin="00:53:15.150" end="00:53:19.380">releasing a video that basically walk you through how to do this it's really simple</p>
      <p begin="00:53:19.380" end="00:53:23.980">so you just basically you do two things you...the javascript snippet for analytics</p>
      <p begin="00:53:23.980" end="00:53:28.410">and then you do this right after the user has given either contact information and that's what shoots</p>
      <p begin="00:53:28.410" end="00:53:32.290">it into drip and you now have captured all information...campaign</p>
      <p begin="00:53:32.290" end="00:53:38.490">engine you activate the account this is really the money shot right here it's a form</p>
