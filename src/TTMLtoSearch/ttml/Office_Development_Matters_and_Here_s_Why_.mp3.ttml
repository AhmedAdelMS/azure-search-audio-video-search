      <p begin="00:00:40.560" end="00:00:43.700">there's one issue from this morning we wanted to take head-on.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:44.810" end="00:00:49.060">Of anybody saw this as it was going on during the keynote</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.060" end="00:00:53.820">I myself didn't get to see it so I wasn't quite sure what was going on it's just a couple messages</p>
      <p begin="00:00:53.820" end="00:00:59.530">...communications just a little bit and it was a little bit about drugs and suspect that...seattle has</p>

      <p begin="00:01:23.320" end="00:01:35.390">to reach out to me I'd be glad to hear from you so let's dive right in...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.390" end="00:01:39.210">So,...talked about this a bunch this morning and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.210" end="00:01:44.100">just to recap I think he was quite passionate and quite enthusiastic this is actually a quote that we</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:48.180">have from last fall he truly believes in the future of authors as</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.180" end="00:01:51.490">a developer platform and in the opportunity</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.490" end="00:01:57.240">that represents for many different kinds of developers both developers working in</p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.240" end="00:02:01.360">isv are building cloud services but also corporate developers</p>
      <p begin="00:02:01.360" end="00:02:04.170">trying-to delivered great experiences to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.170" end="00:02:09.150">in-house employees and there's a couple reasons that that's true one is the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.150" end="00:02:14.400">users the office can attract for solutions and...a function in the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:16.050">...install base and xtraction</p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.050" end="00:02:19.740">and office has as well as the massive growth that we see</p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.740" end="00:02:24.950">in office three sixty five and I know that we've talked about a bunch over the past</p>
      <p begin="00:02:24.950" end="00:02:29.210">months and year but office three sixty five has this reputation as the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:29.210" end="00:02:33.170">...business and microsoft history and,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:33.170" end="00:02:36.810">it is quite an amazing thing to be a part of to really catch that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.810" end="00:02:40.010">wave and actually be part of the catalyst of people moving to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:40.010" end="00:02:43.720">the cloud and now on top of that to offer a developer</p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.720" end="00:02:48.270">platform and surface area that people can take advantage of in order to really</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.270" end="00:02:55.930">drive home not just solutions but solutions helping people be more productive.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:55.930" end="00:03:00.090">So, we've got some ...statistics quantifying what</p>
      <p begin="00:03:00.090" end="00:03:04.600">that actually means just to put a face on what does it mean to be the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:04.600" end="00:03:07.580">fastest-growing business and microsoft history of</p>
      <p begin="00:03:07.580" end="00:03:12.530">is itself has one-point-two billion users and that's office all up that is sort of the full</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.530" end="00:03:17.240">...area for that actually means is when people when we release new things like</p>
      <p begin="00:03:17.240" end="00:03:22.210">release office for ios android it gets an immediate great amount of attention</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.210" end="00:03:26.850">and as we wire that up for add-in extensibility becomes a great target market for</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.850" end="00:03:29.550">you to approach people live in office</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29.550" end="00:03:34.220">...productive...office and this actually means something about the way that they approach</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.220" end="00:03:39.170">solutions inside of office their serious they're doing business and,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.170" end="00:03:43.470">they want to get work done and that actually dramatically changes sort of their profile of</p>
      <p begin="00:03:43.470" end="00:03:49.190">...willingness to invest there's just a ton of data we talked about the api explore and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:49.190" end="00:03:54.160">...the graphic gis we'll talk about that a bunch more right here but just to get a size</p>
      <p begin="00:03:54.160" end="00:03:58.410">for it inside of exchange their over four trillion</p>
      <p begin="00:03:58.410" end="00:04:01.820">emails and office three sixty five of eight hundred-fifty</p>
      <p begin="00:04:01.820" end="00:04:06.500">mating million meetings actually means twenty eight points three meeting million</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.500" end="00:04:11.130">meetings created every day and this just represents a huge amount of data</p>
      <p begin="00:04:11.130" end="00:04:15.950">in capability...you can take advantage of.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:15.950" end="00:04:18.270">And, with that we...of address the fact the you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.270" end="00:04:22.190">we have come a long way let me first release the outlook</p>
      <p begin="00:04:22.190" end="00:04:26.320">...with were powerpoint excel and all of you in the rumah fully built the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.320" end="00:04:31.480">...add-in so you've written...you've written some...scripts in the past and one thing we</p>
      <p begin="00:04:31.480" end="00:04:36.410">...address was the those things will continue to work in the office clients the we ship on</p>
      <p begin="00:04:36.410" end="00:04:40.810">the windows desktop as you've seen in the keynote where we demonstrated on various</p>
      <p begin="00:04:40.810" end="00:04:46.570">of different vices...forward is...be ready to push more with the app model which we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:46.570" end="00:04:51.510">demonstrate today with the admins for both office and for sharepoint with web apps inside that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.510" end="00:04:54.790">...that's really...for us is the will continue to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:54.790" end="00:04:59.010">...that in the office client-but also where you've built things...the ws maybe</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.010" end="00:05:03.100">...exchangeable full trust code on sharepoint sandbox solutions</p>
      <p begin="00:05:03.100" end="00:05:08.240">...will continue to work in the on premises versions of sharepoint sandbox...continue to work in the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:13.410">...service but we...guys to look forward to the...new...that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:13.410" end="00:05:18.210">we've push forward with and...where engineering if it is but it will continue to support that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:18.210" end="00:05:22.700">where your isv or your internal customizations and build on what we what we</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.700" end="00:05:28.580">kind of released of the last ten twenty years and that's really where we kind of moving forward here in the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:28.580" end="00:05:35.440">add-in spice...office sharepoint and with the...as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:37.580">...great so,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:39.390" end="00:05:43.270">this morning such you talked about users in data an...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:43.270" end="00:05:48.280">we actually sort of...boiled down even more simply...here's how we talk about the opportunity</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.280" end="00:05:53.400">and office and the thing that we want you to go do the action so, the first</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.400" end="00:05:58.300">...talk a bunch about all the users of office this creates a great place to sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58.300" end="00:06:03.590">make your applications discover connect users to your service but, in addition</p>
      <p begin="00:06:03.590" end="00:06:08.380">it really does provide this cross-platform form experience and surface area that you</p>
      <p begin="00:06:08.380" end="00:06:12.780">can...to and as we talk about here that's not just about integrating into office that's also</p>
      <p begin="00:06:12.780" end="00:06:17.260">a building your own apps on top so when we say users the called actions quite clear build</p>
      <p begin="00:06:17.260" end="00:06:21.730">atoms that plug-in the office and you can do that today a bunch</p>
      <p begin="00:06:21.730" end="00:06:26.890">of the things that we talked about in the keynote...here is about the ongoing development this is</p>
      <p begin="00:06:26.890" end="00:06:32.710">an investment area where we were going to keep investing building more and providing more</p>
      <p begin="00:06:32.710" end="00:06:36.260">capabilities...for-you over time the second thing is about all</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.260" end="00:06:39.660">that data inside the unify api and point inside the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:39.660" end="00:06:44.580">...and making that available so the call the action is actually again quite clear</p>
      <p begin="00:06:44.580" end="00:06:48.780">its connect to office three sixty five api eyes and you'll be able to build</p>
      <p begin="00:06:48.780" end="00:06:53.690">solutions running on mobile devices running on websites...just make it really easy</p>
      <p begin="00:06:53.690" end="00:06:58.120">and great to connect that productivity data one of the things that doesn't show up on this</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.120" end="00:07:01.410">slide that we think about as critical to how we want to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.410" end="00:07:05.140">approach this problem is really making sure that we come to the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.140" end="00:07:09.980">developers where they are and we make it super easy for you to do those two things at</p>
      <p begin="00:07:09.980" end="00:07:14.910">inness and calling...and that's why we've really taken approach of making sure that</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.910" end="00:07:19.840">everything we do is built on open standards using...standards where appropriate</p>
      <p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:24.220">off protocols...author responses are always in json even going a</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.220" end="00:07:28.120">step further and saying okay if people are going to call these api</p>
      <p begin="00:07:28.120" end="00:07:32.210">...and build mobile apps then they'll need...case running on ios</p>
      <p begin="00:07:32.210" end="00:07:37.470">...so we've built those just little...to make it easy to call the protocol</p>
      <p begin="00:07:37.470" end="00:07:40.460">api and then we went ahead and open-source them as well just</p>
      <p begin="00:07:40.460" end="00:07:44.390">to make it that much easier for people to engage with us the same-store</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44.390" end="00:07:49.210">...story is going to apply to people trying to build more service or server-side</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.210" end="00:07:54.240">connections talking...api is so we're investing just as much...sure we provide the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:07:59.350">riches decays there as well and then the last thing we talked about this morning and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:59.350" end="00:08:04.310">...repeat here is about really going beyond this these are the fundamentals</p>
      <p begin="00:08:04.310" end="00:08:08.520">...over time will bring more intelligence will bring the smarts of the office</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08.520" end="00:08:14.050">graphs and we'll bring you the...can super-power your solutions.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:14.050" end="00:08:19.630">All right let's dive right in and take a look at some office evidence so we'll just stop there a little bit</p>
      <p begin="00:08:19.630" end="00:08:22.150">...the audience kind of like snickering a little bit around this whole</p>
      <p begin="00:08:22.150" end="00:08:26.870">...we've talked about the app model a little bit in the past and we've kind of and sharepoint</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.870" end="00:08:31.340">apps sharepoint sometimes...ship...apps sometimes...office apps</p>
      <p begin="00:08:31.340" end="00:08:36.590">...apps office in outlook astrophysics so...stumbling block where</p>
      <p begin="00:08:36.590" end="00:08:42.230">we had word apps all of with apps in them</p>
      <p begin="00:08:42.230" end="00:08:47.200">apps enact so access apps so the marketing department sought to stop.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:47.200" end="00:08:50.090">So, that train and from now on will actually be cooling those</p>
      <p begin="00:08:50.090" end="00:08:53.290">attitudes very much roles of the time outlook</p>
      <p begin="00:08:53.290" end="00:08:55.800">...word...so...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:57.070" end="00:09:03.440">Powerpoint...sharepoint allen's so that's the only...address...just move on forwards</p>
      <p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:08.840">...cool...is loaded from the screen if I say apps one more time</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.840" end="00:09:13.650">...I'm going to get buzzed onstage so robles so we'll see how far we get before we said</p>
      <p begin="00:09:13.650" end="00:09:18.650">it would acts as this point forward excellence...does turn out that it flows pretty naturally</p>
      <p begin="00:09:18.650" end="00:09:23.990">of the tongue and I think everybody understands what we mean the things I do want to talk about is that we've</p>
      <p begin="00:09:23.990" end="00:09:27.670">had...out in the market as I mentioned we started with twenty</p>
      <p begin="00:09:27.670" end="00:09:32.750">thirteen so people can build these things today and really start going and they are seeing</p>
      <p begin="00:09:32.750" end="00:09:37.430">traction one of the beautiful things about working in the cloud and working with always</p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.430" end="00:09:42.210">up-to-date clients is that we really get good rich information about how much</p>
      <p begin="00:09:42.210" end="00:09:47.530">users in usage we're actually gettingand, how much traction we see so,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:47.530" end="00:09:52.320">these are just sharing some of the internal statistics that we've got about end-users jumping on top</p>
      <p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:57.930">of modern at inness ...advantage of it and what we see is ...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:57.930" end="00:10:02.650">the growth curve is exactly the right say that's exactly the right kind of month on</p>
      <p begin="00:10:02.650" end="00:10:07.630">...exponential growth that you want to see we've exceeded three million active users in</p>
      <p begin="00:10:07.630" end="00:10:12.550">a month the growth is an hundred fourteen percent and people are using</p>
      <p begin="00:10:12.550" end="00:10:17.150">and launching these things on a regular basis so that's just for us data and</p>
      <p begin="00:10:17.150" end="00:10:22.240">signals the great...on...something we've got the right kind of adoption happening</p>
      <p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:27.130">now we're just looking for ways to make them even more discoverable and help you is developers plug</p>

      <p begin="00:14:14.320" end="00:14:18.200">...underscore there one is that I'm really excited about this example for combining the two</p>
      <p begin="00:14:18.200" end="00:14:22.970">things together about building at inness and then calling this service api</p>
      <p begin="00:14:22.970" end="00:14:28.250">...to talk a little bit more about this at notion of app commands we're</p>
      <p begin="00:14:28.250" end="00:14:33.210">very excited about going forward we showed you a lot of task...at...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:33.210" end="00:14:37.760">a ribbon...ends like this one or super exciting later on we'll show you some more</p>
      <p begin="00:14:37.760" end="00:14:42.710">in content dead-ends but we think that there's a lot of potential for over time as we build and</p>
      <p begin="00:14:42.710" end="00:14:48.590">invest more in the model for an lighting up new kinds of experiences and types of atoms.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:48.590" end="00:14:51.220">So, the other one of the shown here I'm going to switch for role</p>
      <p begin="00:14:53.120" end="00:14:54.920">...having some devices onstage.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:56.050" end="00:14:57.640">All right so</p>
      <p begin="00:14:57.640" end="00:15:02.490">this is getting back into the sat demo and I want to talk a little bit more about how it's put together and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:02.490" end="00:15:07.490">a little bit more about some of the capabilities that you can light up by taking advantage of</p>
      <p begin="00:15:07.490" end="00:15:12.400">the richer object model that we provide right here and excel and it's just tons of fun to be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:15:12.400" end="00:15:18.290">do this demo directly from within itself the so again this is an add-in that's talking</p>
      <p begin="00:15:18.290" end="00:15:22.770">an sat on prime...using sap gateway</p>
      <p begin="00:15:22.770" end="00:15:27.460">from microsoft really exposes sap data using...and in</p>
      <p begin="00:15:27.460" end="00:15:32.440">...data which makes it super easy for us to consume inside of the microsoft environment and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:32.440" end="00:15:35.360">the simple thing that I can do first it which I showed you this morning</p>
      <p begin="00:15:35.360" end="00:15:42.040">so it's fairly get the data all I'm glad it work this morning.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:42.040" end="00:15:49.420">...like...that's good.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:49.420" end="00:15:56.150">To come back that...conductive ellen...program logo...that was all right.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:56.150" end="00:16:00.990">...so, let's drew back into the sales...demo and show a couple additional things that live</p>
      <p begin="00:16:00.990" end="00:16:07.820">there so what I talked about this morning and the first thing to call out is now I'm going on a</p>
      <p begin="00:16:07.820" end="00:16:13.190">...so this is actually inside of outlook for the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:13.190" end="00:16:15.460">...and we've enabled the same</p>
      <p begin="00:16:15.460" end="00:16:20.280">...model running there so it hopefully it super clear by now how we think about</p>
      <p begin="00:16:20.280" end="00:16:24.380">...how we think about making sure that your solutions are really work</p>
      <p begin="00:16:24.380" end="00:16:28.680">and run everywhere that office runs so let's go ahead and open up the sales</p>
      <p begin="00:16:28.680" end="00:16:32.870">...tab again it's pulling the to in cc information off of the mail thread</p>
      <p begin="00:16:32.870" end="00:16:36.550">...using that to look up the company's inside of sales force and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:36.550" end="00:16:41.640">...opportunities one of the things that I can do that we didn't get to do is really...just</p>
      <p begin="00:16:41.640" end="00:16:46.500">wanted to drive home this notion of taking action in context because this is</p>
      <p begin="00:16:46.500" end="00:16:51.020">the whole value propped...is developers and solution builders is that you can make</p>
      <p begin="00:16:51.020" end="00:16:53.310">sure your users are productive and live-in</p>
      <p begin="00:16:53.310" end="00:16:57.680">...inside the experiences that they love so here I can go ahead and actually</p>
      <p begin="00:16:57.680" end="00:17:05.710">just create this contact for this person that didn't previously exist inside of sales force?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:11.490" end="00:17:12.940">Has gone?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:12.940" end="00:17:25.970">Way connected okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:25.970" end="00:17:31.500">Yeah, actually they could have done that and, that would be an interesting enhancement to do since you</p>
      <p begin="00:17:31.500" end="00:17:36.060">are able to refer the to in cc information...excellent look at this.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:36.060" end="00:17:43.240">Let's push the button...super exciting.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:43.240" end="00:17:48.360">Ok, the main thing that I want to show you is that you do have more our and this object model</p>
      <p begin="00:17:48.360" end="00:17:53.330">...detail...a dump some information out of line-of-business system the first thing I might go do is start</p>
      <p begin="00:17:53.330" end="00:17:57.700">to make some changes and this really is the scenario of the exec</p>
      <p begin="00:17:57.700" end="00:18:02.130">on-the-go walking on hall working with this information they go ahead and update the age and</p>
      <p begin="00:18:02.130" end="00:18:07.120">then when they're done with it they can push the compare and save button so now I've been working</p>
      <p begin="00:18:07.120" end="00:18:11.820">inside their spreadsheet and the question is what I done and I do have a</p>
      <p begin="00:18:11.820" end="00:18:16.410">push backed sap to save but before I do that I'd like to check and see</p>
      <p begin="00:18:16.410" end="00:18:21.110">what I did so what we show here is...for nicely formatting the...that I</p>
      <p begin="00:18:21.110" end="00:18:25.990">...was able to go and scan through the entire table selection find the individual cells</p>
      <p begin="00:18:25.990" end="00:18:29.880">that actually been updated in on the right-hand side in a task...go</p>
      <p begin="00:18:29.880" end="00:18:34.840">...notify the users about what was the what was the actual modification</p>
      <p begin="00:18:34.840" end="00:18:39.650">...we think that kind of rich compelling experience really lit up by this service on the back-end</p>
      <p begin="00:18:39.650" end="00:18:44.650">really turns excel into this sort of extension of the end-to-end solution that</p>
      <p begin="00:18:44.650" end="00:18:46.600">...providing</p>
      <p begin="00:18:46.600" end="00:18:51.480">...in addition to that one of the questions we had quite frequently is what whatever happened to</p>
      <p begin="00:18:51.480" end="00:18:56.440">...so we're actually show here is that we've actually involved in up</p>

      <p begin="00:23:07.450" end="00:23:11.890">actually this gets back to this notion of making sure that we leave</p>

      <p begin="00:23:52.860" end="00:23:57.660">picture about what I can go do today what's coming in preview and</p>
      <p begin="00:23:57.660" end="00:24:01.960">...are the things that will be coming down the road and hopefully it's clear from the way we're</p>
      <p begin="00:24:01.960" end="00:24:06.200">having this conversation that we want to be really open about where we're headed and what the future looks</p>
      <p begin="00:24:06.200" end="00:24:11.120">like so this is our attempt to come super clean make it super clear about the</p>

      <p begin="00:24:15.260" end="00:24:19.710">next so today you can go build these at...they will work across-the-board</p>
      <p begin="00:24:19.710" end="00:24:23.440">and thirty-two...they will largely work in the online</p>
      <p begin="00:24:23.440" end="00:24:27.770">a web apps and as we talked about the demo we are now releasing</p>
      <p begin="00:24:28.970" end="00:24:34.650">...update for excel for that will enable them to run in that environment as well the things</p>
      <p begin="00:24:34.650" end="00:24:39.460">that teams actively working on our making sure that were consistent across the whole family</p>
      <p begin="00:24:39.460" end="00:24:43.530">of ios devices so we pushing hard on that and upcoming months and make to</p>
      <p begin="00:24:43.530" end="00:24:47.110">those updates get into that apple store and in that way</p>
      <p begin="00:24:47.110" end="00:24:50.680">your solution show up across all the ios devices that</p>
      <p begin="00:24:50.680" end="00:24:54.210">your users have and then the very next thing after that which</p>
      <p begin="00:24:54.210" end="00:24:58.810">we're very excited about is really going after the mac and will be able to share some of the framework and infrastructure</p>
      <p begin="00:24:58.810" end="00:25:03.710">...we firmly believe in the vision that these solutions need to run everywhere</p>
      <p begin="00:25:03.710" end="00:25:08.430">that office runs and that offices cross-platform productivity experience</p>
      <p begin="00:25:08.430" end="00:25:12.220">so later this year we'll start work on making sure we get android</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.220" end="00:25:15.990">and uw a fully enabled and we'll deliver those out</p>
      <p begin="00:25:15.990" end="00:25:19.560">...incremental updates as quickly as we can provide them and that so</p>
      <p begin="00:25:19.560" end="00:25:24.330">that transparent wvu on the how're thinking about the development roadmap?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:24.330" end="00:25:26.750">Yeah, and, the other thing to kinda talk about is the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:26.750" end="00:25:31.040">...and spices...refocusing on where we all with the office...with the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:31.040" end="00:25:35.930">sharepoint...aspect...had a lot of them and...as well as...malicious of others because well, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:35.930" end="00:25:39.700">and, actually this is an important context for usoffice</p>
      <p begin="00:25:39.700" end="00:25:43.740">...actually they do show up inside of office twenty thirteen so you can</p>
      <p begin="00:25:43.740" end="00:25:48.740">enable them for users that don't actually have office three...sharepoint</p>
      <p begin="00:25:48.740" end="00:25:53.160">...interconnected office three sixty five or connected to an on prime sharepoint installation</p>
      <p begin="00:25:53.160" end="00:25:58.120">we've actually seen the same general shape of curve where we have...this</p>
      <p begin="00:25:58.120" end="00:26:02.490">...growth curve and what we see is were closing in on a billion</p>
      <p begin="00:26:02.490" end="00:26:06.770">necessary who that would be exciting those one of those things that gets we did a million?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:07.920" end="00:26:12.990">Active users for...sharepoint we see fourteen million launches</p>
      <p begin="00:26:12.990" end="00:26:18.060">happening in the month of march and again all of those are driving api calls so these are the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:18.060" end="00:26:22.900">kind of metrics that we're tracking to make sure that the model is doing what we want and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:22.900" end="00:26:28.050">delivering the capabilities for use developers to connect to users...one of the call examples we have here from</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.050" end="00:26:32.080">a sharepoint perspective is the madison's which you map out about in the past is</p>
      <p begin="00:26:32.080" end="00:26:36.960">actually a microsoft lc...legal team of build something for a particular scenario that was</p>
      <p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:41.260">putting those guys spy jump over here too my hap</p>
      <p begin="00:26:41.260" end="00:26:45.870">...and I launch the medicine or...this is actually using this notion of</p>
      <p begin="00:26:45.870" end="00:26:50.800">legal teams that have matters where they have to store documents and emails of records around a</p>
      <p begin="00:26:50.800" end="00:26:55.790">particular legal topic and they consistently have these things flying around and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:55.790" end="00:26:59.920">...and sharing documents in different ways so what they did was they built this</p>
      <p begin="00:26:59.920" end="00:27:05.090">...dashboard that allowed them to track exactly what was going on with all</p>
      <p begin="00:27:05.090" end="00:27:07.790">that matters so they hosted this all inside</p>
      <p begin="00:27:07.790" end="00:27:11.770">...the leveraging sharepoint is a back-end to store individual matters</p>
      <p begin="00:27:11.770" end="00:27:16.650">...individual site collections so they're all encapsulated the security trimmed a...that has</p>
      <p begin="00:27:16.650" end="00:27:21.170">that contain a feedback and the users can go through and start seeing stacks around things</p>
      <p begin="00:27:21.170" end="00:27:26.490">like what the status of those matters all within the whole organization how much document</p>
      <p begin="00:27:26.490" end="00:27:31.220">shown is going on within each of those individual matters and...as far as using things like the</p>
      <p begin="00:27:31.220" end="00:27:36.350">...services and...biif features...map delay gr locations of those...those</p>
      <p begin="00:27:36.350" end="00:27:41.420">matters are relevance to where they are across the whole of microsoft legal so as an example here of</p>
      <p begin="00:27:41.420" end="00:27:46.160">kind of crossing the boundaries of not just thinking about me myself as a sharepoint developer by</p>
      <p begin="00:27:46.160" end="00:27:49.610">...actually created am and outlook add-in so...I</p>
      <p begin="00:27:49.610" end="00:27:55.320">come into my emails here I have an email where I have an attachment what I launch that add-in what</p>
      <p begin="00:27:55.320" end="00:27:59.790">is going to do is going to use the office js api to notice the there</p>
      <p begin="00:27:59.790" end="00:28:04.570">are actually attachments associated with this email and then there are able to go in here</p>
      <p begin="00:28:04.570" end="00:28:08.430">upload the attachments and decide what matters...</p>
      <p begin="00:28:08.430" end="00:28:14.340">can pick my matter now take into account this is authenticated back into sharepoint but I'm actually</p>
      <p begin="00:28:14.340" end="00:28:17.610">...a in sort of outlook</p>
      <p begin="00:28:17.610" end="00:28:22.350">...indirectly so I...ui...you can see here the with the...on a is pretty</p>
      <p begin="00:28:22.350" end="00:28:27.810">...out here but that would force me to sign into this particular environment and...upload that pick my</p>
      <p begin="00:28:27.810" end="00:28:31.650">...so what we're trying to encourage here is...don't think</p>
      <p begin="00:28:31.650" end="00:28:36.150">these things in silos this demo actually demonstrates lonely and outlook added</p>
      <p begin="00:28:36.150" end="00:28:40.290">...a sharepoint added but also that notion of a web application that's</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.290" end="00:28:44.460">...inside of the apple...that moyers page and this is something</p>
      <p begin="00:28:44.460" end="00:28:47.140">...actually hosting rightnow internally something</p>
      <p begin="00:28:47.140" end="00:28:51.430">we're looking to share with everyone here as well, yeah, and, let me take a moment</p>
      <p begin="00:28:51.430" end="00:28:56.840">to just be clear about what we're really after because I paid for anyone to walk away thinking I</p>
      <p begin="00:28:56.840" end="00:29:01.680">...that microsoft going into the legal vertical and that's not the goal what we're actually trying to show is that</p>
      <p begin="00:29:01.680" end="00:29:05.800">we're excited about the model and we're excited about the possibilities so we're holding this up</p>
      <p begin="00:29:05.800" end="00:29:09.520">is an internal tool that we built that could not to a bunch of scenarios</p>
      <p begin="00:29:09.520" end="00:29:13.500">...you might have internally but even more importantly as a model for</p>
      <p begin="00:29:13.500" end="00:29:18.080">the best practices around the kinds of things that you can do with the framework we've</p>
      <p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:23.080">delivered and we're working with our best partners inside of this space to make sure that</p>
      <p begin="00:29:23.080" end="00:29:26.930">...light up the same things for them and this really helps,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:26.930" end="00:29:32.620">you know, crystallizes galvanize we're going for the industry all right so</p>
      <p begin="00:29:32.620" end="00:29:36.810">let's flip over and talk about a new kind of application expense a bunch of time talking about</p>
      <p begin="00:29:36.810" end="00:29:41.540">...and how those can connect...sharepoint and sharepoint capabilities but</p>
      <p begin="00:29:41.540" end="00:29:46.210">let's take a step back and talk about the new kid on the block which is just about three sixty</p>
      <p begin="00:29:46.210" end="00:29:50.530">five web apps we first started talking about these last fall and what it</p>
      <p begin="00:29:50.530" end="00:29:54.640">...just a way to easily connect and existing web application that you've</p>
      <p begin="00:29:54.640" end="00:29:58.490">...into office three sixty five and there's a couple reasons that you'd</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.490" end="00:30:03.500">...do that to make it easy for users to find to make it easy for users to</p>
      <p begin="00:30:03.500" end="00:30:08.460">in and then to use that as a platform that you would want to drive even more</p>
      <p begin="00:30:08.460" end="00:30:13.000">...three sixty five integration so all you really have to do is register your app</p>
      <p begin="00:30:13.000" end="00:30:18.720">in ad and then it shows up in this thing that we have a real name or just keep going...the waffles</p>
      <p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:23.670">...going to...the app...it's the app launcher thank...we have this thing with engineering</p>
      <p begin="00:30:23.670" end="00:30:28.160">...have...internal names I live with and they can never let go of the that's right we have to force</p>
      <p begin="00:30:28.160" end="00:30:31.290">them open-to-the-public outbound so the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:31.290" end="00:30:36.290">easiest way to show up in the app launcher as it says there on the slide is register with active</p>
      <p begin="00:30:36.290" end="00:30:41.370">directory that gets you instantaneously single sign on and that makes it super easy for you to</p>
      <p begin="00:30:41.370" end="00:30:43.530">turn right around and call</p>
      <p begin="00:30:43.530" end="00:30:46.910">...unify api endpoint call...three sixty</p>
      <p begin="00:30:46.910" end="00:30:54.820">five a gis to get access to file mail calendar contact information?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:54.820" end="00:30:58.380">And, in addition we make it super easy-to-use put those things into the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:58.380" end="00:31:02.870">store we continue to invest in not just how do we make the experience great for</p>
      <p begin="00:31:02.870" end="00:31:07.690">users but how can we help your users discover the application there's a bunch of ways that</p>
      <p begin="00:31:07.690" end="00:31:11.720">we like this up one of which is the store in addition we of course have</p>
      <p begin="00:31:11.720" end="00:31:15.840">a corporate catalog where organizations can distribute the own apps that</p>
      <p begin="00:31:15.840" end="00:31:21.400">they care about a few the things that we've made super easy as around first if I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:31:21.400" end="00:31:26.120">acquire one of those new web apps we've made it very easy from within office three sixty five a</p>
      <p begin="00:31:26.120" end="00:31:31.090">ui to go ahead connect to the store find a web app added directly into</p>
      <p begin="00:31:31.090" end="00:31:35.880">my apple launcher the second thing is we've enabled inside the store</p>
      <p begin="00:31:35.880" end="00:31:40.530">functionality for previewing your application so if you'd like to have that kind of targeted</p>
      <p begin="00:31:40.530" end="00:31:45.380">limited audience beta where your producing initial releases...make sure that it works the way you</p>
      <p begin="00:31:45.380" end="00:31:49.950">want to work before you go broaden public wavelet that up and then the last thing is that</p>
      <p begin="00:31:49.950" end="00:31:52.980">where you see this across-the-board it's here with the</p>

      <p begin="00:33:50.490" end="00:33:57.260">So, with that I'm going to jump back to the slides.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:57.260" end="00:34:01.530">I'm going to talk a little bit about component so we talked about part of the office at...the</p>
      <p begin="00:34:01.530" end="00:34:06.200">...and this notion of web apps that live within the service one of the...things that</p>
      <p begin="00:34:06.200" end="00:34:10.800">we've started to experience now is this notion of leveraging the sky for business aspects of the</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.800" end="00:34:12.020">...exploit services</p>
      <p begin="00:34:12.020" end="00:34:19.300">...and to do this virtually jump back so that do dot com scenario which is.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:19.300" end="00:34:23.000">And,...you'll see here is the you may have noticed fewer various</p>
      <p begin="00:34:23.000" end="00:34:26.300">...I launched to dot com here.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:26.300" end="00:34:30.070">In the bottom without one the oracle...we also had a sky-high</p>
      <p begin="00:34:30.070" end="00:34:35.030">...so this...is richer the back to the rumah...me a brand-new e-mail and you'll notice now</p>

      <p begin="00:34:38.210" end="00:34:43.190">associated with the conversation id that we had...existing inside of exchange and I can go</p>
      <p begin="00:34:43.190" end="00:34:47.380">through in the meeting options say I want to use scarf as part of this I'll include the</p>

      <p begin="00:34:52.120" end="00:34:56.880">that's in that service right if I jumped over to the...launched dot com from that</p>
      <p begin="00:34:56.880" end="00:35:00.710">...experience I would seal this information but what can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:35:00.710" end="00:35:05.700">the hurt riches ready for this is if I click here on the sky inside this</p>
      <p begin="00:35:05.700" end="00:35:10.300">...we've now launch the do dot com experience in a web browser we've actually got the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:10.300" end="00:35:15.360">...imbed directly inside that...interface that was really neat here</p>
      <p begin="00:35:15.360" end="00:35:20.090">is the on the right-hand side I have to do dot com experience as well so I can be</p>
      <p begin="00:35:20.090" end="00:35:24.870">described cohort without clip...having and starts...different things into this</p>
      <p begin="00:35:24.870" end="00:35:29.940">...again if I just use that experience here of adding my speaker names and,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:29.940" end="00:35:35.060">going through and having some...that I need to make sure I get my make sure I get</p>
      <p begin="00:35:36.080" end="00:35:40.160">...is that all we had a see the directly...you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:40.160" end="00:35:44.160">we have both the skylight user interface work and have that communications</p>
      <p begin="00:35:44.160" end="00:35:48.790">going forward as well as the right-hand side being inside my experience more specification</p>
      <p begin="00:35:48.790" end="00:35:49.290">side-by-side?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:50.850" end="00:35:54.650">Now it looks like maybe out wi-fi is not going to</p>
      <p begin="00:35:54.650" end="00:36:03.290">place is always the high-risk high-tension part of are we getting through on wi-fi?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:03.290" end="00:36:06.620">Connecting...actually a couple things I want to interject here what</p>
      <p begin="00:36:06.620" end="00:36:11.550">we're actually using just to make sure everyone gets it such a mentioned briefly this morning</p>
      <p begin="00:36:11.550" end="00:36:16.830">scope has just announced in preview their scope web</p>
      <p begin="00:36:16.830" end="00:36:21.610">sdk and that enables a couple things the first is that you get a bunch of restful</p>
      <p begin="00:36:21.610" end="00:36:26.130">api and javascript...on top of it do basic things like presence</p>
      <p begin="00:36:26.130" end="00:36:31.100">notifications chat and you can just use that directly within the applications that you</p>
      <p begin="00:36:31.100" end="00:36:36.030">build the second part is actually shown here is a plug-in which is allowing you</p>
      <p begin="00:36:36.030" end="00:36:41.050">to embed the sky experience inside of that solution that you build we're</p>
      <p begin="00:36:41.050" end="00:36:46.000">very excited about this as a model for how people think about delivering rich experiences</p>
      <p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:49.890">...sort of the inverse of the add-in but we really want to make sure that where</p>
      <p begin="00:36:49.890" end="00:36:54.570">office has this high-value experience like we have escape that you can use</p>
      <p begin="00:36:54.570" end="00:36:59.550">that to build the target experience that you want to make sure users can be and,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:59.550" end="00:37:04.160">productive without having to leave the context of your solution and what you don't realize</p>
      <p begin="00:37:04.160" end="00:37:08.750">series is that skylight is actually showing richard...a very...without video just doesn't</p>
      <p begin="00:37:08.750" end="00:37:15.780">picked up so, that just shows you where...guy with the imbed aspect we know that in it doesn't always have to be</p>
      <p begin="00:37:15.780" end="00:37:20.050">about being inside our user experience qubit you earning that user experiencing embedding</p>
      <p begin="00:37:20.050" end="00:37:25.430">...stuff in there and that is one example of where we're going with that preview technology...</p>
      <p begin="00:37:25.430" end="00:37:30.840">think now it's time to get on to your most exciting topic...the office...yeah,...so,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:30.840" end="00:37:33.070">this really is as we think about the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:33.070" end="00:37:38.190">...building more momentum lighting up new workloads and having a constant</p>
      <p begin="00:37:38.190" end="00:37:41.960">...of new capabilities that we expose to developers</p>
      <p begin="00:37:41.960" end="00:37:45.160">...we think about this surface area driving new</p>
      <p begin="00:37:45.160" end="00:37:48.730">...and it's great for us because it's very easy for us understand</p>
      <p begin="00:37:48.730" end="00:37:52.250">...being successful and that's when more and more</p>
      <p begin="00:37:52.250" end="00:37:54.760">...being called because that means developers</p>
      <p begin="00:37:54.760" end="00:37:58.640">are building solutions users are enjoying the solutions and getting value out</p>
      <p begin="00:37:58.640" end="00:38:03.610">of them and we're all having impact we want to have so we are really starting to see that fly</p>
      <p begin="00:38:03.610" end="00:38:07.840">...go fourteen point four million daily api calls from...when</p>
      <p begin="00:38:07.840" end="00:38:12.330">...but we're actually seeing is the total up in the billions which means we are really</p>
      <p begin="00:38:12.330" end="00:38:17.160">starting to drive this getting a lot done using api running against</p>
      <p begin="00:38:17.160" end="00:38:22.690">office so I want to flip over here...flip this slide?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:22.690" end="00:38:26.660">Jumping the gun...excited so what we wanted...actually share was that</p>
      <p begin="00:38:26.660" end="00:38:31.600">...a releasing...new api in...we've talked a lot about mail calendar</p>
      <p begin="00:38:31.600" end="00:38:36.580">...files we talk about the ipo in the past...you know, there's lots of other products and services</p>
      <p begin="00:38:36.580" end="00:38:41.410">available office...expired...a demos some other them products</p>
      <p begin="00:38:41.410" end="00:38:45.540">...which we can now integrate directly into the video puerto api</p>
      <p begin="00:38:45.540" end="00:38:51.070">the groups api...demo before and preview and also the one that api which we did show</p>
      <p begin="00:38:51.070" end="00:38:55.060">the do dot com demo earlier on and in the future will actually have</p>
      <p begin="00:38:55.060" end="00:38:59.510">the tossed api as well which we'll talk a little bit more about ignite timeframes and</p>
      <p begin="00:38:59.510" end="00:39:04.560">we have added some additional scenarios based on feedback we got from user voice and from the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:08.950">...what very closely with to those existing api...released in</p>
      <p begin="00:39:08.950" end="00:39:13.210">...october timeframes...a juror so we're going to show now is</p>
      <p begin="00:39:13.210" end="00:39:18.000">...unify...the we demonstrating the keynote and...going to go through a few more scenarios</p>
      <p begin="00:39:18.000" end="00:39:23.620">...highlight with the api explore which you can actually use...your...</p>
      <p begin="00:39:23.620" end="00:39:27.950">Yeah, and, actually there's another presentation being given tomorrow I think</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.950" end="00:39:30.710">it ten thirty where they're more into the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:30.710" end="00:39:35.000">unify endpoint and they'll actually using this is a great thing about development</p>
      <p begin="00:39:35.000" end="00:39:39.250">...they'll be using the production environment version of api explore so you get</p>
      <p begin="00:39:39.250" end="00:39:41.510">...we did there where they have nice collapse so</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.510" end="00:39:46.710">expand on the days on responses and that's pretty cool but, let's take a look we've got here I</p>
      <p begin="00:39:46.710" end="00:39:51.110">...talk a little bit more about the structure of the url that I'm actually making</p>
      <p begin="00:39:51.110" end="00:39:56.490">a request with it's pretty straightforward...dot microsoft dot com that is the name of</p>
      <p begin="00:39:56.490" end="00:40:01.560">unify api endpoints...number in there and as you can see were in previews so it</p>
      <p begin="00:40:01.560" end="00:40:06.460">just says beta but that's where we'll use vone vtwo etc and from there I just go into my</p>
      <p begin="00:40:06.460" end="00:40:10.950">tenant or my individual token such as slash me and I can start to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:10.950" end="00:40:14.660">find entities and drive to edges off of those entities and really navigate the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:14.660" end="00:40:19.030">graph so the first thing is actually that I can just run a query call users</p>
      <p begin="00:40:19.030" end="00:40:23.440">in this is actually doing what you would expect which is give-me back all the users in</p>
      <p begin="00:40:23.440" end="00:40:27.870">my active directory of course it's helping us to page through them since we don't get overwhelmed</p>
      <p begin="00:40:27.870" end="00:40:31.610">and responses reasonable but the thing I did this morning</p>
      <p begin="00:40:31.610" end="00:40:34.710">...is exactly corresponds to one</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.710" end="00:40:39.860">...common scenarios is...me filter this down help me write a query so we support a notion</p>
      <p begin="00:40:39.860" end="00:40:45.320">of attributes that you can query on in this case filter equals department and then there's</p>
      <p begin="00:40:45.320" end="00:40:50.120">filter on where the department is equal to operations so we'll run that get back</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.120" end="00:40:54.030">...set of results and then let's just scan down and start to feel pretty</p>
      <p begin="00:40:54.030" end="00:40:58.970">confident that in fact we're getting back the results that we would want to see their and</p>
      <p begin="00:40:58.970" end="00:41:01.960">...highlight the graphing this</p>
      <p begin="00:41:01.960" end="00:41:06.240">...from that collection to an individual user every object in the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:06.240" end="00:41:10.600">graph actually gets a unique and persistent id so this is a huge advantage</p>
      <p begin="00:41:10.600" end="00:41:15.600">in terms of thinking about how can I make sure I can get a placeholder so can always get back to that object</p>
      <p begin="00:41:15.600" end="00:41:19.290">...time even if it moves around so I can take advantage of that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:19.290" end="00:41:24.130">...this individual user and then from there as we</p>
      <p begin="00:41:24.130" end="00:41:28.760">talk about this morning super easy to just drill instantaneously in the files</p>
      <p begin="00:41:29.850" end="00:41:33.820">...ok now again?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:33.820" end="00:41:37.840">We've got this persistent...idea which I can navigate to get to the file and</p>
      <p begin="00:41:37.840" end="00:41:43.130">let's just think a look at some of the properties that you find off of there one of the most interesting things is the</p>

      <p begin="00:41:48.430" end="00:41:52.490">...navigation going from node edge I can go from the file</p>

      <p begin="00:49:02.540" end="00:49:06.930">on in the week where...look deeper into how we build those things with</p>

      <p begin="00:49:12.720" end="00:49:15.740">There was one lost every one of the show so I'm going to</p>

      <p begin="00:49:22.900" end="00:49:28.950">...up...so this is another quick look at another sample that</p>
      <p begin="00:49:28.950" end="00:49:33.600">we've written and you can kinda see how our methodology goes at this point we've written</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.600" end="00:49:38.010">the code we produced an application and then we're going to go put it up on get hub actually I think they re</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38.010" end="00:49:42.940">...live this week it's great so, you can download this and see what we did and build</p>
      <p begin="00:49:42.940" end="00:49:47.650">the exactly the same kind of thing even take these ideas and enhance them the notion here</p>
      <p begin="00:49:47.650" end="00:49:52.550">is that boy when I'm on the road there's a few key conversations if you keep people I want to keep track</p>
      <p begin="00:49:52.550" end="00:49:58.870">of...if I open up my mail inbox I am ...to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:58.870" end="00:50:03.650">a stress and panic about twenty thousand things going on I didn't want to know about so this app is called email</p>
      <p begin="00:50:03.650" end="00:50:08.410">...and what it does is just give me a filtered view of what's coming on so I can just</p>
      <p begin="00:50:08.410" end="00:50:13.180">do the writing by the family and only pay attention to a specific set of conversations what you see</p>
      <p begin="00:50:13.180" end="00:50:19.880">actually...some nice ios ui that we've built ... swiping but,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:19.880" end="00:50:24.860">the key thing is that this is going against the office three sixty-five api...to get the contents</p>
      <p begin="00:50:24.860" end="00:50:30.700">my inbox...a bunch of easy-to-use settings like hey let's take a look at</p>

      <p begin="00:50:53.670" end="00:50:58.660">the nice thing here is when you launch that email actually have the ability to do it follows so I can say I want to</p>
