      <p begin="00:00:59.900" end="00:01:04.820">media experiences team in os g of microsoft and this is my partner in crime</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.820" end="00:01:09.120">I'm baller...kumar a program manager on the creative media experience esteem would</p>
      <p begin="00:01:09.120" end="00:01:14.040">jason and I handle the audio side of things so out of curiosity how many people in the audience</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.040" end="00:01:18.960">have actually built hey I recommend so many faces it makes me smile how many people</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.960" end="00:01:22.880">have actually built...like an audio or video out before.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.040" end="00:01:24.900">...good number of</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.900" end="00:01:28.030">...how many of you are csharp developers.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.450" end="00:01:35.010">How many of you people are cplus-plus developers how many people like writing cplus-plus</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.010" end="00:01:36.520">versus csharp?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:36.520" end="00:01:41.280">Good how many people of the cplus-plus developers have written media foundation</p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:46.550">and media foundation transform code how many of those of you that have done that enjoyed the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.550" end="00:01:47.050">process.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.300" end="00:01:53.070">Okay,...all hazard...that's what...kind of figure okay well we have some good stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:01:53.070" end="00:01:56.860">for you today then I'm just going-to go ahead and dive into this quick</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.860" end="00:01:59.130">...business thing remember to fill</p>
      <p begin="00:01:59.130" end="00:02:04.130">in evaluation form or you guys have seen this I'm just going to skip this...the end of the talk.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.130" end="00:02:07.640">So, other things as a create a person myself outside of work I'm a musician</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.640" end="00:02:11.650">...a lot of creative work one the things that I love is no matter where I</p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.650" end="00:02:15.470">go I always have some type of device within reach so</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.470" end="00:02:19.640">whenever that inspiration hits I can go ahead and capture that on my</p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.640" end="00:02:22.870">...reach over and capture that latest song idea</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.870" end="00:02:26.880">the latest film idea and really just go with it before the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.880" end="00:02:32.260">...leaves me the problem is to really have a great experience doing this</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.260" end="00:02:36.360">you need to have great apps that you can interact with as a user and what</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.360" end="00:02:41.290">we're here to talk about is really how are we making it better to build those great apps for all of</p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.290" end="00:02:46.240">you so we really want to talk about the story of building these great creative</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.240" end="00:02:52.100">and video apps really easily on the windows ten platform so diving into this today</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.100" end="00:02:55.390">there's a couple areas that we're going to talk about we're going to talk about</p>
      <p begin="00:02:55.390" end="00:03:00.150">kind of the video editing experience and what we're doing around creative video we're going to talk about</p>
      <p begin="00:03:00.150" end="00:03:03.420">the creative audio side of things and what we're doing there as well as</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.420" end="00:03:07.810">touching on some music oriented apis like...and stuff like that to tell you how</p>
      <p begin="00:03:07.810" end="00:03:11.080">...evolved in the last year...course we just want to focus on</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.080" end="00:03:15.260">...demos lots of code to show you guys all of this stuff hopefully all</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.260" end="00:03:21.720">this stuff working on the bits that you have available to go grab and start using today?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:21.720" end="00:03:24.050">So, first let's talk about creative video experiences</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.050" end="00:03:28.380">when we actually take a look back and look at how media editing</p>
      <p begin="00:03:28.380" end="00:03:30.750">exists today let's say on windows three-point-one.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:31.800" end="00:03:35.300">Yes, we have a fully customizable video editing experience</p>
      <p begin="00:03:35.300" end="00:03:39.750">...media foundation very powerful there's a lot of things you can do</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.750" end="00:03:42.520">...requires a lot of lower-level code requires a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:03:42.520" end="00:03:46.560">of domain expertise and frankly takes a lot of code to do even the most</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:51.090">basic of scenarios like let's say I want to do basic things like combining one video</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.090" end="00:03:55.520">onto another video...to overlay one video on another video I want to work with</p>
      <p begin="00:03:55.520" end="00:04:00.490">those videos by let's say adding a background audio track or something like that any of those</p>
      <p begin="00:04:00.490" end="00:04:05.440">scenarios that should ultimately be really easy...kind of the basic scenarios...creative</p>
      <p begin="00:04:05.440" end="00:04:12.070">video experience becoming incredibly difficult when you're having to do with media foundation today.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.070" end="00:04:17.050">one of the things that we did that we announced last year build is on windows phone eight-point</p>
      <p begin="00:04:17.050" end="00:04:22.700">one we introduce this new media composition api that makes it super simple</p>
      <p begin="00:04:22.700" end="00:04:26.960">which...a couple lines of code to do the basic things like trimming a video</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.960" end="00:04:31.590">stitching different videos together adding background audio so on now to show that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:31.590" end="00:04:35.920">an action let's say I want to do a simple thing where I just want to trim</p>
      <p begin="00:04:35.920" end="00:04:40.000">twenty two seconds from a file well once again we're talking about just a couple</p>
      <p begin="00:04:40.000" end="00:04:44.890">lines of code here to do this kind of thing let's say I want to build a slide show where I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:44.890" end="00:04:49.570">take my favorite thirty photos and come...have each of them displayed</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.570" end="00:04:54.290">for ten seconds and then encode that to a video and be able to send it out</p>
      <p begin="00:04:54.290" end="00:04:58.650">to my favorite social network or what have you once again with media composition in windows</p>
      <p begin="00:04:58.650" end="00:05:01.940">phony point one this became a lot more simple to do where</p>
      <p begin="00:05:01.940" end="00:05:05.730">...just talking about us add the photos as media clips</p>
      <p begin="00:05:05.730" end="00:05:10.550">...this composition and you can dot you...bind that composition to a media elements</p>
      <p begin="00:05:10.550" end="00:05:15.740">use media trance coder anything to say that out very simple?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.740" end="00:05:18.590">But, one of the things at the start of windows ten.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:19.670" end="00:05:23.550">We started asking ourselves okay that's great and all but what do we need</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23.550" end="00:05:26.900">to do necks what's kind of the next things that need to be done</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.900" end="00:05:31.960">and one of the first things we realised any of you been in the video space for a while</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31.960" end="00:05:35.180">...started to realize video starting to...be</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.180" end="00:05:39.770">a stagnant thing anymore the order static piece of content that you work with</p>
      <p begin="00:05:39.770" end="00:05:44.690">a used to be that maybe I have a bunch of video files on my computer that I grab those</p>
      <p begin="00:05:44.690" end="00:05:49.440">I manipulate them I edit them and then I produce some video file on the output</p>
      <p begin="00:05:49.440" end="00:05:54.430">what we're seeing now is video is becoming a lot more about interactivity what are the ways that users are</p>
      <p begin="00:05:54.430" end="00:05:59.360">wanting to interact with the videos and one of the cool things is those interactions</p>
      <p begin="00:05:59.360" end="00:06:04.740">are actually starting to be captured in the content itself so some great work from partners like...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.740" end="00:06:09.520">smith with their coaches I app vanessa...movie maker app and even our own hollow</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.520" end="00:06:13.480">...product you see this idea that now I'm annotating on a video I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.480" end="00:06:18.380">eating on top of it I'm wanting to manipulated in some way and those actions that I'm taking</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.380" end="00:06:24.380">with the video are the things I want to capture naturally save out so then we</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24.380" end="00:06:29.370">started to look okay this is great we introduce some cool features and windows sony point one that a lot of people really</p>
      <p begin="00:06:29.370" end="00:06:34.270">enjoy how do we take this role of interactive ness and bring it</p>
      <p begin="00:06:34.270" end="00:06:38.910">to windows ten well the first kind of obvious step is we need to take this media</p>
      <p begin="00:06:38.910" end="00:06:43.910">composition api and bring it to the universal windows platform so now media</p>
      <p begin="00:06:43.910" end="00:06:48.600">composition you-can use this regardless of what device running as long as...university as long as</p>
      <p begin="00:06:48.600" end="00:06:53.170">...universal windows platform device so you can run it on your xbox you</p>
      <p begin="00:06:53.170" end="00:06:57.770">can run on windows phone you can run on windows write the code once and that exact same code</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57.770" end="00:07:01.750">ones on all the different device families.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.750" end="00:07:03.230">But, then there was still a gap we</p>
      <p begin="00:07:03.230" end="00:07:07.300">...that's great for the basic scenarios like trimming in stitching</p>
      <p begin="00:07:07.300" end="00:07:12.070">and adding audio but the other ways that you want to interact with video creating cool of</p>
      <p begin="00:07:12.070" end="00:07:16.410">...maybe overlaying one video on top of another video maybe I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:16.410" end="00:07:20.990">overly photos on top of photos or any combination of the sorts.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:20.990" end="00:07:25.930">You know, those were once again immediate steps where you could use media composition for the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:25.930" end="00:07:30.350">basic things...was designed for but then you ultimately fell off this...this clip</p>
      <p begin="00:07:30.350" end="00:07:35.440">of complexity we're now you have to down dive down back in the media foundation</p>
      <p begin="00:07:35.440" end="00:07:40.220">...working in cplus-plus again so we added some cool things in windows</p>
      <p begin="00:07:40.220" end="00:07:45.120">ten that bridges that gap...you have to draw a to have to fall off the cliff we want</p>
      <p begin="00:07:45.120" end="00:07:49.820">to keep you in the things that keep you focused on adding user value</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.820" end="00:07:54.320">to your experiencing that will keep your users coming back for more.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.320" end="00:07:57.520">So, rather than talk...show you all this kind of stuff I just want to coded</p>
      <p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:06.090">...I would rather drop in the visual studio switches over and show you some of this an action.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.090" end="00:08:09.990">So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to first leverage the basic stuff that we did</p>
      <p begin="00:08:09.990" end="00:08:14.150">around media composition and we'll see this app in action in a</p>
      <p begin="00:08:14.150" end="00:08:19.340">...the first thing I need to do is create a media clip?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:19.340" end="00:08:24.030">I've already have the user pick from a storage file and then I can just take that media clip</p>
      <p begin="00:08:24.030" end="00:08:29.850">in I can go ahead and add it to our composition and now we have a media clip to work</p>
      <p begin="00:08:29.850" end="00:08:34.710">with well we were talking about the our of overlays now to actually make this and overlays the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.710" end="00:08:39.590">great thing about the overly support now in media composition with windows ten is</p>
      <p begin="00:08:39.590" end="00:08:44.440">that overlays also build on top of media clips so anything that could be source from a media clipper</p>
      <p begin="00:08:44.440" end="00:08:49.000">foreign image of file of photo what color can also be used</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.000" end="00:08:53.480">as overlays so let's go ahead and add some overlays.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:53.480" end="00:08:55.760">What I'm going to do...up here I'm going-to go ahead and</p>
      <p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:09:02.300">add-in overlay layer which we'll talk in a minute what in overlay layer is?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:02.300" end="00:09:03.950">Media a</p>
      <p begin="00:09:03.950" end="00:09:09.740">cane composition overlay layers and I'm going to add that overlay layer.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.740" end="00:09:12.150">Now of course now we have this overly layer think about</p>
      <p begin="00:09:12.150" end="00:09:16.350">an overly layer as kind of like a container it's something that we can throw a bunch</p>
      <p begin="00:09:16.350" end="00:09:21.180">of overlays into so-if you want-to do twelve overlays and keep them in one rendering</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.180" end="00:09:25.790">paths or you want to animate them together or something you can group them together in this concept</p>
      <p begin="00:09:25.790" end="00:09:30.230">...layer will actually show one of the other cool things custom composite errors</p>
      <p begin="00:09:30.230" end="00:09:36.330">are made possible with this idea of overlay layers but let's go ahead before we do that let's go ahead and</p>
      <p begin="00:09:36.330" end="00:09:37.190">add some overlays.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:40.460" end="00:09:44.920">Once again I mention so-you creamed overlay and we're going to add that media overlay to</p>
      <p begin="00:09:44.920" end="00:09:48.840">our overly layer that we added and you can see the media overlay we just paths</p>
      <p begin="00:09:48.840" end="00:09:50.280">...the clip the rest is</p>
      <p begin="00:09:50.280" end="00:09:57.370">basically the position that we want to overlay and we can give it a capacity and that kind of thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:57.370" end="00:10:01.800">what actually this to show you how many overlays we can handle let's do the same thing</p>
      <p begin="00:10:01.800" end="00:10:08.170">...add the ability of doing some other overlays as well?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:08.170" end="00:10:12.100">Go ahead and run this now this project you'll notice...all csharp.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:12.100" end="00:10:15.230">It's real when we get further long you'll see that one</p>
      <p begin="00:10:15.230" end="00:10:19.530">...when two-d to do a lot of cool stuff in the overlays and effects and with</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.530" end="00:10:23.830">the new when two-d support all that kind of stuff but the reason it takes longer to compile is of course</p>
      <p begin="00:10:23.830" end="00:10:29.030">...using project and to compile this all natively.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:29.030" end="00:10:33.600">So, let's go ahead and add a base video.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:33.600" end="00:10:38.320">...going to add and overlay if I play...</p>
      <p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:39.850">You can see the top left.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:40.880" end="00:10:44.970">We have one video that we've overlaid on top of another video once again</p>
      <p begin="00:10:44.970" end="00:10:49.860">no graphical hiccups or anything like that the top left actually has opacity so you can see the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:49.860" end="00:10:55.330">bottom layer through it really easy just once again couple lines of code to get this but,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:55.330" end="00:11:00.680">you know, are not all impressed by that...what I want...a couple more?</p>
      <p begin="00:11:00.680" end="00:11:05.420">I heard people really like photos of kids so I'm going to add a couple overlays from.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:05.420" end="00:11:09.850">My first son about six years ago.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:09.850" end="00:11:14.520">Let's play this now you can see were overlying for videos on top of a</p>
      <p begin="00:11:14.520" end="00:11:16.860">...video and each one of them have opacity</p>
      <p begin="00:11:16.860" end="00:11:20.520">...managing that once again we're talking about just a couple lines of code rather</p>
      <p begin="00:11:20.520" end="00:11:26.260">than the literally thousands of lines of...have taken in media foundation.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:26.260" end="00:11:29.960">Once again cool nice and simple really easy I like this.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:30.990" end="00:11:31.820">You know, that's not</p>
      <p begin="00:11:31.820" end="00:11:38.050">all that special let's start showing you some of the cool stuff that we can actually start doing so I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:11:38.050" end="00:11:42.260">come over here and when I create that layer one of the things...notices</p>
      <p begin="00:11:42.260" end="00:11:47.090">there's an overload for media overlay layer where I can actually pass in a custom composite</p>
      <p begin="00:11:47.090" end="00:11:52.910">...definition so I have a custom...we're going to build here?</p>
      <p begin="00:11:52.910" end="00:11:57.570">Let me give it.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:57.570" end="00:12:01.580">...so we're going to use this example composite or that I've...</p>
      <p begin="00:12:01.580" end="00:12:05.170">And, in this example composite or if I go here an example</p>
      <p begin="00:12:05.170" end="00:12:10.120">composites just something that implements this new uw p interface I video composite</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.120" end="00:12:16.940">or if we can go there and the methods that are most relevance.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:16.940" end="00:12:21.600">...to use this composite frame method that we'll give you all the surfaces that you need to</p>
      <p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:26.560">overlay and then you give us the output frame on the...which we'll see in a minute and</p>
      <p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:31.430">then setting coding properties will tell you how the videos encoded and give you the direct</p>
      <p begin="00:12:31.430" end="00:12:35.830">three-b device so then you can use directory...when</p>
      <p begin="00:12:35.830" end="00:12:41.340">two-d even use anything like that to actually do your overlays with which is actually what we're going to do</p>
      <p begin="00:12:41.340" end="00:12:45.650">you how many people did any of you in the...talk before this online</p>
      <p begin="00:12:45.650" end="00:12:50.500">...okay just a couple so you guys are going to see some fun stuff here</p>
      <p begin="00:12:51.800" end="00:12:55.620">where what I'm going to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:55.620" end="00:13:00.280">This is...two-d so once again we're all in csharp and I have.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:00.280" end="00:13:04.180">This composite frame contacts where if I go into the definition of that we</p>
      <p begin="00:13:04.180" end="00:13:07.910">give you the background frame which is the base that your overlying on top of</p>
      <p begin="00:13:07.910" end="00:13:11.290">...we give you a bunch of surfaces to overlay which you'll see all these are just</p>
      <p begin="00:13:11.290" end="00:13:14.750">I direct three-d surfaces so anything that can work</p>
      <p begin="00:13:14.750" end="00:13:19.720">with those basic interfaces and interop with those basic interfaces you can use to implement a</p>
      <p begin="00:13:19.720" end="00:13:24.100">...custom composite roars and effects as we'll see now and then you just give us</p>
      <p begin="00:13:24.100" end="00:13:28.580">the output frame so what I've done in this setup is I've created</p>
      <p begin="00:13:28.580" end="00:13:33.160">the output surface from that output frame on the context and then I've created a</p>
      <p begin="00:13:33.160" end="00:13:37.840">rendell target in a drawing session which are from one to the to basically be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:13:37.840" end="00:13:43.690">draw to it so of course one thing that I want to do is I want to go ahead</p>
      <p begin="00:13:43.690" end="00:13:45.740">...I don't want...search.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:45.740" end="00:13:47.560">I want to.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:47.560" end="00:13:52.920">Get all the surfaces that we want to overlay.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:52.920" end="00:13:57.850">And, one thing you'll notice a from then I look at this member we were we specified like</p>
      <p begin="00:13:57.850" end="00:14:02.840">the position and the opacity and all that kind of stuff but at this point we're just dealing with</p>
      <p begin="00:14:02.840" end="00:14:06.720">the interop types...direct three-d surface so it's just directory d surface we</p>
      <p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:11.570">want to go get that original overlay as well which you can do directly off the context object</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.570" end="00:14:15.600">as well so I'm going to say overlaying context.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:17.030" end="00:14:23.340">Get overlay for surface and I'm going to pass in that surface were overlaying and then I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:14:23.340" end="00:14:25.110">draught so.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:25.110" end="00:14:29.270">Rectangles are boring so let's actually draw the videos as</p>
      <p begin="00:14:29.270" end="00:14:32.440">...lips is just to see if we...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:32.440" end="00:14:37.100">I'm pretty sure we can at least the other times I've run this demo it's worked so,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:37.100" end="00:14:41.530">I'll let's draw the overlays.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:41.530" end="00:14:44.830">You can see I'm creating a canvas image brush and other</p>
      <p begin="00:14:44.830" end="00:14:49.740">when to deconstruct from the from the bitmap which is essentially</p>
      <p begin="00:14:49.740" end="00:14:53.120">the overly surface that we've given and then I'm using...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:53.120" end="00:14:57.460">with that brush to actually paint the image onto</p>
      <p begin="00:14:57.460" end="00:15:01.440">the overlay and the output frame now something else</p>
      <p begin="00:15:01.440" end="00:15:06.020">...have heard common feedback about is this is great</p>
      <p begin="00:15:06.020" end="00:15:10.210">...then people a basic scenario that they might want to use text overlay I want</p>
      <p begin="00:15:10.210" end="00:15:15.140">to actually overly a like a title slide or something like that on top of a video.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:15.140" end="00:15:19.030">Once again before even a basic scenario like that if you were in windows</p>
      <p begin="00:15:19.030" end="00:15:23.670">code would require you to drop down to media foundation but now.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:23.670" end="00:15:29.410">Since I'm in...two-d I can use the draw text as part of the canvas drawing session</p>
      <p begin="00:15:29.410" end="00:15:36.050">when two-d the overly some text so let's go ahead and run that.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:36.050" end="00:15:36.510">Once again it's</p>
      <p begin="00:15:36.510" end="00:15:41.470">going to take a bit to build because this is all compiling again with project and as we come up now I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:15:41.470" end="00:15:48.280">going-to go ahead and overlay all the different configure this again with all the different overlays.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:48.280" end="00:15:51.210">Our base one that's pretty cool.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:51.210" end="00:15:58.840">...that overlay...the three kid ones.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:58.840" end="00:16:03.270">I'm going to plea this you'll see we have tax drawn.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:03.270" end="00:16:05.820">We have the one that we have all the videos</p>
      <p begin="00:16:05.820" end="00:16:09.790">obvious is graphics accelerated it's all in csharp so you can see even though</p>
      <p begin="00:16:09.790" end="00:16:13.990">...overlying text...overlying for videos on-base video there's no glitches</p>
      <p begin="00:16:13.990" end="00:16:21.820">and performance...it all just runs perfectly smoothly.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:21.820" end="00:16:23.400">Okay, now we're kind of stepping it up a</p>
      <p begin="00:16:23.400" end="00:16:33.380">bits as ball would say network cooking with fire so that's actually move this along.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:33.380" end="00:16:39.590">And, later we're actually going to see one of our partners what kind of cool stuff they've done with that custom composite are</p>
      <p begin="00:16:39.590" end="00:16:43.910">So, let's talk about effects let's say I want to do it some type of image filter that</p>
      <p begin="00:16:43.910" end="00:16:48.650">applying to the video before no,...went out to msdn I grabbed</p>
      <p begin="00:16:48.650" end="00:16:54.310">are official sample and here's how to do a gray-scale effect in a windows store app about two</p>
      <p begin="00:16:54.310" end="00:16:59.260">thousand lines of media foundation transform code all a lot of plumbing and everything like that</p>
      <p begin="00:16:59.260" end="00:17:03.250">once again media foundation incredibly flexible incredibly powerful</p>
      <p begin="00:17:03.250" end="00:17:06.640">kinda overkill for a lot of things using this new model we're talking about a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:06.640" end="00:17:11.080">ninety lines of code which that boils down to basically five maybe six lines of</p>
      <p begin="00:17:11.080" end="00:17:15.420">...decode so about a ninety six percent reduction in code to</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.420" end="00:17:20.220">do basic video...with this new model.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:20.220" end="00:17:23.930">Now this new model there's kind of three key things that we talk about that</p>
      <p begin="00:17:23.930" end="00:17:28.340">we like about this model first of all I imagine it's universal windows platform based</p>
      <p begin="00:17:28.340" end="00:17:31.790">so you write your effect once it'll run on windows</p>
      <p begin="00:17:31.790" end="00:17:35.830">they'll run on windows phone it'll run on xbox all that kind of stuff so once again allows you</p>
      <p begin="00:17:35.830" end="00:17:42.480">to focus on the things that you care about and...going to be up...for your users.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:42.480" end="00:17:45.880">One of the other thing is the course using existing libraries and code</p>
      <p begin="00:17:45.880" end="00:17:50.310">since we interop everything as just a direct three-d surface and a direct three-d</p>
      <p begin="00:17:50.310" end="00:17:55.270">device if you have the existing cheaters like direct actuators...ll</p>
      <p begin="00:17:55.270" end="00:17:59.920">shoulders you can use direct three-d to actually apply your own custom shatters to these video</p>
      <p begin="00:17:59.920" end="00:18:01.730">...if you want to use the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:01.730" end="00:18:05.900">...imaging sdk we also have support for another construct called so</p>
      <p begin="00:18:05.900" end="00:18:10.860">for software bitmap which is a common piece of technology that allows you to interop easily with</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.860" end="00:18:16.090">the...imaging sdk or other...out there that allow you to do cpu</p>
      <p begin="00:18:16.090" end="00:18:22.290">based image processing and as well as we just saw one two-d and the other thing is it's cry</p>
      <p begin="00:18:22.290" end="00:18:27.990">...usable across the entire media stack so while we're showing...show this in</p>
      <p begin="00:18:27.990" end="00:18:32.780">the use of media composition this is stuff that you can easily apply the use of</p>
      <p begin="00:18:32.780" end="00:18:37.060">...to media elements to media capture to media</p>
      <p begin="00:18:37.060" end="00:18:40.910">trans coder any of those other media apis so once again you create</p>
      <p begin="00:18:40.910" end="00:18:44.110">the effect once in a very powerful way</p>
      <p begin="00:18:44.110" end="00:18:51.360">and you can use it anywhere you want across any device family across any media api.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:51.360" end="00:18:54.210">So, let's actually show the implementation of an...</p>
      <p begin="00:18:55.370" end="00:19:01.180">Rather than talking...you about what all this looks like let's actually just show it to-you...action.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:01.180" end="00:19:05.000">So, one thing that I need to do on that basis video</p>
      <p begin="00:19:05.000" end="00:19:09.220">let's add-in effect to it so adding in effect we have these</p>
      <p begin="00:19:09.220" end="00:19:15.090">video affect definitions this is part of the api...shipped...windows phony point one.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:15.090" end="00:19:16.550">So, I'm going to creates</p>
      <p begin="00:19:16.550" end="00:19:21.200">...that I'm going to create a new video...definition and I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:28.750">pass in this new saturation video effects that we're doing.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:28.750" end="00:19:33.460">You might ask why this extra...role of a video fact definition I can I just</p>
      <p begin="00:19:33.460" end="00:19:38.390">...instance of an effect well one of the major uses the media composition</p>
      <p begin="00:19:38.390" end="00:19:42.950">is it's basically just a graph that represents operations you want to its in the typical</p>
      <p begin="00:19:42.950" end="00:19:47.700">nonlinear editing it's not destructive so it's just defining the intention of the operations and</p>
      <p begin="00:19:47.700" end="00:19:50.900">what you can do is you wire up the entire media composition and you can</p>
      <p begin="00:19:50.900" end="00:19:55.750">actually purses that to a file and save it as a project and then load it late load</p>
      <p begin="00:19:55.750" end="00:20:01.140">it later so this way we can low by having that acid or the runtime class name from</p>
      <p begin="00:20:01.140" end="00:20:05.910">...rt we can actually load those only ads needed and it allows us to kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:20:05.910" end="00:20:10.290">...we inflate the media composition graph?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:10.290" end="00:20:15.210">let's implement the saturation video...once again you'll see it's just implementing</p>
      <p begin="00:20:15.210" end="00:20:19.270">...interface I basic video...which is a new interface and windows ten</p>
      <p begin="00:20:19.270" end="00:20:23.220">...a boils down to once again the setting coding properties that here we're creating a new wintry</p>
      <p begin="00:20:23.220" end="00:20:28.130">...canvas device with a direct three-d device from the media pipeline and it's</p>
      <p begin="00:20:28.130" end="00:20:31.860">basically process frame method if we look at the context you'll see there's</p>
      <p begin="00:20:31.860" end="00:20:36.240">...input frame and output frame so we give you the input frame you give us the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:42.310">result in the output frame and then we will use that in the rest of the pipeline.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:42.310" end="00:20:46.640">So,...do this let's do the same thing where I'm going to</p>

      <p begin="00:21:04.660" end="00:21:11.000">...as opposed to that two thousand lines of...code but I kinda want to make it a</p>
      <p begin="00:21:11.000" end="00:21:15.270">little cooler so one of things I have is in the app</p>
      <p begin="00:21:15.270" end="00:21:20.200">you might have seen a slide bar while the video is running I want</p>
      <p begin="00:21:20.200" end="00:21:23.890">to actually control that sly bar in change the parameters to the effect</p>
      <p begin="00:21:23.890" end="00:21:28.450">while the video is running so that a user can perhaps preview how they</p>
      <p begin="00:21:28.450" end="00:21:33.110">want the effect to look and then snap-on that value so everything in the</p>

      <p begin="00:21:41.470" end="00:21:46.140">I'm passing in a saturation value based on that slider and all I need to do is when I</p>

      <p begin="00:21:48.950" end="00:21:54.600">Of this effect I'm also going to give it that configuration and then in my</p>

      <p begin="00:21:57.890" end="00:21:59.850">I'm going to read from it me create this</p>
      <p begin="00:21:59.850" end="00:22:03.280">parameter so in set.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:03.280" end="00:22:06.390">Set properties...different method we give you the property sets that was</p>

      <p begin="00:22:19.090" end="00:22:21.410">We'll go ahead and build that and run this.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:21.410" end="00:22:25.030">After build this allow us to press play on the video</p>
      <p begin="00:22:25.030" end="00:22:31.020">...actually tweak the slider value while the videos running I'm going to have</p>

      <p begin="00:22:52.310" end="00:22:55.000">Nci...full control over this no</p>

      <p begin="00:23:04.540" end="00:23:05.040">Ok.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:06.050" end="00:23:06.360">So, this</p>
      <p begin="00:23:06.360" end="00:23:11.350">is a quick one what's actually before I bring my partner up on stage.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:11.350" end="00:23:14.150">I want to show you some cool stuff that.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:14.150" end="00:23:15.130">David and</p>
      <p begin="00:23:15.130" end="00:23:19.200">...did the in the audience somewhere I'm pretty sure</p>
      <p begin="00:23:19.200" end="00:23:23.690">...they are there in the front-row so there the creators of movie maker eight-point one</p>
      <p begin="00:23:23.690" end="00:23:28.340">on windows phone one of the top paid apps in the store and we worked with them with this new api</p>
      <p begin="00:23:28.340" end="00:23:33.670">say hey guys we want you to go create some cool stuff with this so I want to show off what they</p>
      <p begin="00:23:33.670" end="00:23:38.360">actually did for us in a very short amount of time actually</p>
      <p begin="00:23:38.360" end="00:23:44.490">to show you the our of this...keep fingers crossed that are reboot the machine...</p>
      <p begin="00:23:44.490" end="00:23:48.240">Break this demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:50.250">So, this is a preview specifically for</p>
      <p begin="00:23:50.250" end="00:23:55.150">the build conference of movie maker ten that they worked on.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:55.150" end="00:23:58.550">You can see I can play it and then I'm scrolling through and eigen</p>
      <p begin="00:23:58.550" end="00:24:03.670">...clips and all that kind of stuff the cool thing I want to show you...transition support</p>
      <p begin="00:24:03.670" end="00:24:11.530">so...overlays here's a simple fade you'll see you can fade to the next one.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:11.530" end="00:24:14.640">Let's do a slide I'm actually going to do a different</p>
      <p begin="00:24:14.640" end="00:24:17.820">using animation let's balance it out.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:17.820" end="00:24:22.640">From the top and let's zoom on it when we're started.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:22.640" end="00:24:26.120">Play that's.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:26.120" end="00:24:28.530">You'll see boom group.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:28.530" end="00:24:32.030">Let's get fun though I'm on a.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:32.030" end="00:24:36.480">Is where we cross our fingers hope that this works?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:36.480" end="00:24:42.730">Because I want to show you some of the cooler ones let's do something called slices.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:42.730" end="00:24:44.360">Okay, that's pretty cool.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:45.540" end="00:24:47.640">...alternate...</p>
      <p begin="00:24:47.640" end="00:24:49.830">Number this is all csharp code I think davis</p>
      <p begin="00:24:49.830" end="00:24:56.790">...about ten to eleven cot lines of csharp code okay that was cool.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:56.790" end="00:25:00.600">This is the more cool button I like that all the way up to five hundred let's go up to</p>
      <p begin="00:25:00.600" end="00:25:08.120">five hundred slices and see how this performs.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:08.120" end="00:25:12.290">Let's look at that again now when I played again actually look at the right side of the video and you can</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.290" end="00:25:16.790">see the original video as we're doing the effect is still animated it's still playing</p>
      <p begin="00:25:16.790" end="00:25:20.670">...processing the frame every time.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:20.670" end="00:25:25.570">We are not once again csharp seven-eleven lines of code I think they said the build this entire app</p>
      <p begin="00:25:25.570" end="00:25:30.440">to crm thirty hours something like that thirty hours to bake a lot of the time</p>
      <p begin="00:25:30.440" end="00:25:33.130">with learning when two-d because it's a bit of a different kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:25:33.130" end="00:25:41.840">...to get into if you've been using the libya imaging sdk or something like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:41.840" end="00:25:48.050">...get moi.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:48.050" end="00:25:49.700">Very cool stuff.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:49.700" end="00:25:52.170">So, I'm going to pass...</p>
      <p begin="00:25:52.170" end="00:25:53.750">Is going to come up here and talk</p>
      <p begin="00:25:53.750" end="00:25:57.690">to-you about some of the next stuff that we're working on in the creative space?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:57.690" end="00:26:01.860">All right let's see if you-can get this party rolling.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:01.860" end="00:26:06.430">...started the party with video stuff let's talk about audio stuff.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:06.430" end="00:26:09.260">Creative audio experiences has been a focus for us in windows</p>
      <p begin="00:26:09.260" end="00:26:14.210">stand in general we wanted to make it easier than ever for you guys to write creative</p>
      <p begin="00:26:14.210" end="00:26:19.030">interactive and music applications understand and what does this mean for you guys</p>
      <p begin="00:26:19.030" end="00:26:23.410">what this means is that you guys can concentrate on writing code that makes your</p>
      <p begin="00:26:23.410" end="00:26:27.940">app unique and your...special instead of having to spend time writing code that is</p>
      <p begin="00:26:27.940" end="00:26:33.230">like the underlying pipeline...foundation park and the first part that we</p>
      <p begin="00:26:33.230" end="00:26:37.900">did is invest in maybe some of you may remember that</p>
      <p begin="00:26:37.900" end="00:26:42.770">last year and build jason introduced the preview version of...when</p>
      <p begin="00:26:42.770" end="00:26:47.270">...media apis so why don't we invest in media in the first-place we</p>
      <p begin="00:26:47.270" end="00:26:51.220">invested in mediad because as a lot of you guys who write music apps</p>
      <p begin="00:26:51.220" end="00:26:56.040">...musicians themselves null mute...is the glue that holds...</p>
      <p begin="00:26:56.040" end="00:27:00.890">music creation together is used to connect and control all kinds of devices...</p>
      <p begin="00:27:00.890" end="00:27:05.870">choose to...computers controllers digital instrument synthesizers</p>
      <p begin="00:27:05.870" end="00:27:09.480">women...also used to control some lighting equipment</p>
      <p begin="00:27:09.480" end="00:27:14.360">it's a pretty fascinating protocol so we release this as a preview api</p>
      <p begin="00:27:14.360" end="00:27:19.350">mostly in new get form for visual studio within list this to get feedback</p>
      <p begin="00:27:19.350" end="00:27:23.940">from you guys for the kind of features capabilities that you want to see in the space</p>
      <p begin="00:27:23.940" end="00:27:28.920">and some of the biggest feedback has been that you want to see this not as a new</p>
      <p begin="00:27:28.920" end="00:27:33.640">get package for windows or visual studio...you want to see this big into the platform</p>
      <p begin="00:27:33.640" end="00:27:37.110">...first step towards operating this feedback has been to actually go ahead and</p>
      <p begin="00:27:37.110" end="00:27:44.790">...this into the platform...now available on all of windows ten?</p>
      <p begin="00:27:44.790" end="00:27:46.610">Universal a platforms but what</p>
      <p begin="00:27:46.610" end="00:27:51.460">...this really mean instead of talking apart editing it's more exciting to show you guys</p>
      <p begin="00:27:51.460" end="00:27:55.490">are demo so let me go ahead and show you guys this demo of a little lap that</p>
      <p begin="00:27:55.490" end="00:28:03.690">we have written let's see if demo...are with us.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.690" end="00:28:08.330">Okay, how many of, you know, what the...</p>
      <p begin="00:28:08.330" end="00:28:08.960">Okay,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:08.960" end="00:28:13.700">a few of, you know, for those of you...don't know this is a innovation launch pad it's</p>
      <p begin="00:28:13.700" end="00:28:17.460">a media controller it's got a bunch of buttons that you push the same media</p>
      <p begin="00:28:17.460" end="00:28:21.660">compliance the device of the other end of this connection here I have a computer</p>
      <p begin="00:28:21.660" end="00:28:26.170">it used to create all kinds of cool scenarios you they should just go online search for videos people</p>
      <p begin="00:28:26.170" end="00:28:31.400">do some amazing stuff with this and today we're going to use this in somewhat</p>
      <p begin="00:28:31.400" end="00:28:36.220">nontraditional sense we're not going to use this to send commands the computer we're</p>
      <p begin="00:28:36.220" end="00:28:41.160">going to do the other way we're going to send commands to this device from</p>
      <p begin="00:28:41.160" end="00:28:46.150">the pc and the combines that we're going to send is to turn on some...eds which are under</p>
      <p begin="00:28:46.150" end="00:28:55.960">need these buttons we're going to make it look like a leader...so let's see if this works.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:55.960" end="00:28:58.080">Okay, we have this here</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:02.430">so I hit connect to launch part and then I</p>
      <p begin="00:29:02.430" end="00:29:09.300">...do cool stuff can...see this can you guys...what it says.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:09.300" end="00:29:11.940">Okay, it says hello windows stent</p>
      <p begin="00:29:11.940" end="00:29:15.670">...what it says this is all cool but what does this mean</p>
      <p begin="00:29:15.670" end="00:29:20.230">for a universal windows platform api you can do this with any windows api right where it</p>
      <p begin="00:29:20.230" end="00:29:25.120">is really cool is the our I have here a roxbury</p>
      <p begin="00:29:25.120" end="00:29:29.840">pie running windows ten another motivation launch fired connected to the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:35.470">raspy...I'm going to...deployed this exact same code to the raspy pi over</p>
      <p begin="00:29:35.470" end="00:29:51.890">here without changing a single line of code and show you guys how that's going to work.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.500" end="00:29:59.970">Ok.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:59.970" end="00:30:04.850">So, this is actually running on the rest body pipe exact same</p>
      <p begin="00:30:04.850" end="00:30:07.860">lab zero...changes all I did was change the target and</p>
      <p begin="00:30:07.860" end="00:30:12.030">...it cyclic connector lunch parrot.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:12.030" end="00:30:15.600">Do cool stuff same thing over again?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:15.600" end="00:30:20.350">How cools that exact same code running on a pc</p>
      <p begin="00:30:20.350" end="00:30:23.530">...but if I can sorry...to</p>
      <p begin="00:30:23.530" end="00:30:28.600">...guys imagine...it's such a little tiny device so this gives us the this shows</p>
      <p begin="00:30:28.600" end="00:30:34.870">the our of what the universal windows of platform can really do?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:34.870" end="00:30:39.860">So, let's go back over here but that's not all sure we put</p>
      <p begin="00:30:39.860" end="00:30:45.080">...bigoted into the platform and we made part of the universal windows</p>
      <p begin="00:30:45.080" end="00:30:48.100">But, we've done more than that you guys give us a lot of good feedback and</p>
      <p begin="00:30:48.100" end="00:30:52.000">...this feedback and reprint inc the first one is</p>
      <p begin="00:30:52.000" end="00:30:56.410">...device access this means that more than one app can actually communicate</p>
      <p begin="00:30:56.410" end="00:31:01.780">two-way connected media device simultaneously what this means for...is that you can now</p>
      <p begin="00:31:01.780" end="00:31:06.350">write your apps without having to worry about what other app is accessing this media device</p>
      <p begin="00:31:06.350" end="00:31:10.820">you can concentrate on your creative scenarios instead of having to worry about devices</p>
      <p begin="00:31:10.820" end="00:31:15.080">...piece of feedback we received was that you wanted to use the in build sent</p>
      <p begin="00:31:15.080" end="00:31:18.690">...platform as a media output device so we made this accessible</p>
      <p begin="00:31:18.690" end="00:31:21.910">...through the media apis the inbox microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:31:21.910" end="00:31:26.800">...table g ascent is now listed does just another media output device it</p>
      <p begin="00:31:26.800" end="00:31:30.510">will be enumerated in the media apis you guys can usage you can play</p>
      <p begin="00:31:30.510" end="00:31:35.540">sounds we ate all of that good stuff the only thing to note is that the sounds are pretty large</p>
      <p begin="00:31:35.540" end="00:31:38.670">in sayce especially when it comes to things like roxbury pie</p>
      <p begin="00:31:38.670" end="00:31:42.460">...so we've made this available as a framework package from the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:42.460" end="00:31:47.470">windows store so you need to declares as a dependency in your...makes manifest in your visual</p>
      <p begin="00:31:47.470" end="00:31:52.230">studio project and it will be pulled from the store dynamically upon app launch.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:52.230" end="00:31:56.240">The other part that we also did for the synthesizer is technique</p>
      <p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:00.530">increase the performance and the latency characteristics of the synthesizer and that's not our</p>
      <p begin="00:32:00.530" end="00:32:05.330">...continuing to improve the performance of the synthesizer in future releases and</p>
      <p begin="00:32:05.330" end="00:32:10.150">the other aspect that we improved for many is device naming.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:10.150" end="00:32:14.430">The traditionally windows has had some we've gotten feedback</p>
      <p begin="00:32:14.430" end="00:32:18.660">the names that the media api show or not intuitive so right</p>
      <p begin="00:32:18.660" end="00:32:22.720">now what we do is we try to query the firmware of the...media device to see if</p>
      <p begin="00:32:22.720" end="00:32:26.600">there is a logical name that exists over there and be...doctoral so</p>
      <p begin="00:32:26.600" end="00:32:31.490">when you're creating the devices to your api you find names that you would</p>
      <p begin="00:32:31.490" end="00:32:35.360">identify it for the devices as well as the ports.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:39.280">So, all of this is great board what else did we do in the field</p>
      <p begin="00:32:39.280" end="00:32:43.700">of interactive audio what we have done is we've gotten some feedback</p>
      <p begin="00:32:43.700" end="00:32:47.960">...it we have a bunch of audio apis but they're not always the</p>
      <p begin="00:32:47.960" end="00:32:51.960">easiest to use because some audio apis a very-high-level submodular apis</p>
      <p begin="00:32:51.960" end="00:32:56.430">a video specialized and let's walk through that with the</p>
      <p begin="00:32:56.430" end="00:33:02.570">simple scenario how many of you here have done karaoke at some point.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:02.570" end="00:33:04.730">Yeah, I'm all right.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:04.730" end="00:33:07.130">For those of you would never done it today might be</p>
      <p begin="00:33:07.130" end="00:33:16.550">your lucky day we'll see if we can get you on stage singing karaoke with me at the end of the session.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:16.550" end="00:33:21.200">...so let's draw the block diagram of what we need for</p>
      <p begin="00:33:21.200" end="00:33:24.000">...walked away before we actually going to discussion of these apis.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:25.120" end="00:33:28.630">For those of you...don't have done...okay, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:28.630" end="00:33:33.060">the scenario...simple you have a microphone you have a speaker you have a connection right</p>
      <p begin="00:33:33.060" end="00:33:35.100">what's important also here is that you need</p>
      <p begin="00:33:35.100" end="00:33:40.730">to connection that is low latency it is important to have low latency because nobody wants to hear an echo of</p>
      <p begin="00:33:40.730" end="00:33:45.500">themselves when they're singing into the microphone and what you also need to have is a backing</p>
      <p begin="00:33:45.500" end="00:33:48.510">crack...to have something like...that</p>
      <p begin="00:33:48.510" end="00:33:53.800">you play in the background when you're singing on top of it that...to...your...</p>
      <p begin="00:33:53.800" end="00:33:58.990">We're going to make this scenario slightly more interesting with the potential for blackmail</p>
      <p begin="00:33:58.990" end="00:34:02.710">by a recording this to a file so whoever singing we're</p>
      <p begin="00:34:02.710" end="00:34:08.450">going to record this to a file and this is pretty simple right but these lines you see</p>
      <p begin="00:34:08.450" end="00:34:13.290">or getting messy so let's clean that up but keep the scenario simple let's add a sub</p>
      <p begin="00:34:13.290" end="00:34:16.500">makes a or a mixing let's mix these two signals</p>
      <p begin="00:34:16.500" end="00:34:19.170">...still simple the mixer has to inputs</p>
      <p begin="00:34:19.170" end="00:34:24.180">...output pretty straightforward right I want to make the scenario you</p>
      <p begin="00:34:24.180" end="00:34:28.940">even more interesting I want to apply some kind of an effect on my</p>
      <p begin="00:34:28.940" end="00:34:33.820">mixing mixed signal let's say in this case I want to apply</p>
      <p begin="00:34:33.820" end="00:34:38.170">...river signal I want to make myself sound like I'm singing</p>
      <p begin="00:34:38.170" end="00:34:40.940">in a cave or maybe singing in a studio</p>
      <p begin="00:34:40.940" end="00:34:44.700">and auditorium or something like that and</p>
      <p begin="00:34:44.700" end="00:34:49.460">...singer I will admit that but I don't want to sound terrible especially when the file</p>
      <p begin="00:34:49.460" end="00:34:53.850">is being recorded so maybe I want to have some kind...auto tune or something like this for</p>
      <p begin="00:34:53.850" end="00:34:58.110">see the microphone that makes me sound not so terrible and to make</p>
      <p begin="00:34:58.110" end="00:34:59.870">this scenario even more</p>
      <p begin="00:34:59.870" end="00:35:04.820">interesting let's add a visual aspect to with the takes a</p>
      <p begin="00:35:04.820" end="00:35:09.020">...this data...and maybe does some spectrum analysis and</p>
      <p begin="00:35:09.020" end="00:35:14.510">...waveform things like that and let's now tabulated all of the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:14.510" end="00:35:20.320">things that we need in order to accomplish the...the bottom over there particular</p>
      <p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:25.090">right I mean there's nothing there that we can talk about and we all want things to be easy to code.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:25.090" end="00:35:30.840">So, let's discuss this in terms of what we have today how would you do</p>
      <p begin="00:35:30.840" end="00:35:32.180">So, let me paint a picture the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:32.180" end="00:35:37.330">appear landscape today is that you have some high-level choices you have say the media</p>
      <p begin="00:35:37.330" end="00:35:42.050">element which can do some of these things not a whole lot but it is high-level</p>
      <p begin="00:35:42.050" end="00:35:45.610">...easy-to-use right...it's...api is available all of the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:45.610" end="00:35:50.250">...projected languages csharp javascript etc and then you</p>
      <p begin="00:35:50.250" end="00:35:54.210">have media capture which again cannot do other things but</p>
      <p begin="00:35:54.210" end="00:35:58.890">...still easy-to-use and the problem is there's no easy way to string these</p>
      <p begin="00:35:58.890" end="00:36:04.310">two aps together in order to accomplish the scenario so what are...choices to be help.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:04.310" end="00:36:07.930">Juicing...to falling off the complexity cliff.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:07.930" end="00:36:12.910">That's what you have to do in order to use cplus-plus api they're hard to use nobody wants to go to cplus-plus unless you</p>
      <p begin="00:36:12.910" end="00:36:16.670">have...should gives you a lot of our but with that our also comes a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:36:16.670" end="00:36:21.590">complexity you have x audio you have was happy which are the apis and cplus-plus</p>
      <p begin="00:36:21.590" end="00:36:26.860">...native staff but the problem with that is even things</p>
      <p begin="00:36:26.860" end="00:36:31.550">like playing back a simple mpthree file is not easy why</p>
      <p begin="00:36:31.550" end="00:36:36.120">because x...and what have we don't understand the concept of mpthree which means to</p>
      <p begin="00:36:36.120" end="00:36:40.740">write a simple karaoke hap you have to know rule your own mpthree parser</p>
      <p begin="00:36:40.740" end="00:36:44.250">item sign up for dot I don't want to write my own mpthree parser just because they want</p>
      <p begin="00:36:44.250" end="00:36:49.470">...simple karaoke app same thing with saving to a file if I want to write the to like recording</p>
      <p begin="00:36:49.470" end="00:36:52.290">...and pthree or something I don't want to have to</p>
      <p begin="00:36:52.290" end="00:36:55.940">write my own will mpthree parser in order to figure out where to put what</p>
      <p begin="00:36:55.940" end="00:36:59.700">...in order to solve this the introduced a</p>
      <p begin="00:36:59.700" end="00:37:03.560">...api in windows stand called audio...</p>
      <p begin="00:37:03.560" end="00:37:08.470">Liked name suggests audio graph is a graph base dpi what is a graph</p>
      <p begin="00:37:08.470" end="00:37:11.820">adp I mean it means you have the concept of</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.820" end="00:37:15.860">nodes the nodes accomplish different things you can make them do different things and you</p>
      <p begin="00:37:15.860" end="00:37:20.560">just random along and you realize whatever scenario you want.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:20.560" end="00:37:25.460">And, lets it as you can see it suffice it fulfills all</p>
      <p begin="00:37:25.460" end="00:37:30.550">of...and this is an api that has been designed with interactive audio in</p>
      <p begin="00:37:30.550" end="00:37:35.500">mind you don't have to twist other apis that were not designed for interactive audio to relays</p>
      <p begin="00:37:35.500" end="00:37:40.470">your scenario plus you get to work in the high-level language like csharp even all</p>
      <p begin="00:37:40.470" end="00:37:44.720">if your coding over there and the best part it's a universal windows platform api so</p>
      <p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:49.390">trans everywhere including...to.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:49.390" end="00:37:54.190">What does this mean...audio graph so let's translate?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:54.190" end="00:37:55.800">The objects that we saw the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:55.800" end="00:37:59.230">...into audio...objects.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:59.230" end="00:38:02.660">The audio crafts uses...very similar concept like</p>
      <p begin="00:38:02.660" end="00:38:06.310">...calls these objects nodes that it strings them along together and the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:06.310" end="00:38:10.630">nor names are pretty self-explanatory you have your device input node which</p>
      <p begin="00:38:10.630" end="00:38:15.630">is what mike you have your diverse output node which is what is speaker file input file</p>
      <p begin="00:38:15.630" end="00:38:20.890">output similar for you have your submits node and like jason mentioned he introduced</p>
      <p begin="00:38:20.890" end="00:38:25.880">the I basing video affect similarly you have the I basic argue effect that can be</p>
      <p begin="00:38:25.880" end="00:38:29.960">used altered the universal windows platform apis that you can</p>
      <p begin="00:38:29.960" end="00:38:33.840">use to process data you can write-in csharp...without having to worry</p>
      <p begin="00:38:33.840" end="00:38:38.160">about writing heavy-duty cplus-plus score just to have a simple effect</p>
      <p begin="00:38:38.160" end="00:38:43.390">in this case we were he was doing gray-scale in our case we're doing a is</p>
      <p begin="00:38:43.390" end="00:38:44.240">...analysis.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:45.290" end="00:38:48.020">So, let's.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:48.020" end="00:38:52.910">Move to visual studio where we're going to try and create</p>
      <p begin="00:38:52.910" end="00:39:20.520">this api or create this karaoke up with the stuff that we've shown.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:20.520" end="00:39:24.540">Okay, so, what do you guys think?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:24.540" end="00:39:28.780">That the...different components that need to be there we looked at a diagram</p>
      <p begin="00:39:28.780" end="00:39:32.140">let's build each of those diagrams or each of those nodes that we</p>
      <p begin="00:39:32.140" end="00:39:36.340">sign the previous diagram encode the first we need to create...audio</p>
      <p begin="00:39:36.340" end="00:39:40.790">...instance in order to bind all of this together before we create a audio</p>
      <p begin="00:39:40.790" end="00:39:44.060">...instance what...need to do</p>
      <p begin="00:39:44.060" end="00:39:49.060">...normally contributed with something in this case you can't...out what is called</p>
      <p begin="00:39:49.060" end="00:39:54.060">a settings object so you first create the sightings object and then you pasta</p>
      <p begin="00:39:54.060" end="00:39:57.270">...the settings object into the creation of audio</p>
      <p begin="00:39:57.270" end="00:40:00.720">graph so this creating...with the setting for</p>
      <p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:08.520">simply sake in our current demo we're just going to.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:08.520" end="00:40:11.220">The only settings we're going to specify is the audio</p>
      <p begin="00:40:11.220" end="00:40:15.040">...category and david who is</p>
      <p begin="00:40:15.040" end="00:40:19.780">goo speaking in the coming days is going to delve deep into what these audio categories</p>
      <p begin="00:40:19.780" end="00:40:24.770">mean but for now we're playing a media related stuff so we're going to pick media this is the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:24.770" end="00:40:29.690">only non optional part of the settings object we're going to clean the settings object and we have</p>
      <p begin="00:40:29.690" end="00:40:33.660">an asynchronous method...create the asic</p>
      <p begin="00:40:33.660" end="00:40:37.950">...business audio graph it returns the result object the result</p>

      <p begin="00:40:46.730" end="00:40:49.220">These enough rightly lines of code...the to create audio</p>
      <p begin="00:40:49.220" end="00:40:53.580">...and now we need to do what stringing together for</p>
      <p begin="00:40:53.580" end="00:40:58.170">...sound from the speakers.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:58.170" end="00:41:02.840">That's a two lines of code is all you need to be able to make a connection to the speaker</p>
      <p begin="00:41:02.840" end="00:41:07.140">you have a line that says create device output node similarly returns</p>
      <p begin="00:41:07.140" end="00:41:09.890">...just like you saw previously boom that's</p>
      <p begin="00:41:09.890" end="00:41:14.690">...the next part is going to be creating a</p>
      <p begin="00:41:15.790" end="00:41:21.510">device input node for the microphone.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:21.510" end="00:41:31.090">That's it you need to provide a media capture category over here.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:31.090" end="00:41:34.660">Please ignore the...printed...running preview bits of windows and as you can...</p>
      <p begin="00:41:35.780" end="00:41:40.080">You create a media of the device input</p>
      <p begin="00:41:40.080" end="00:41:44.080">...asynchronous methods and all of these calls are unlocking new return the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:44.080" end="00:41:49.040">result object in which you have a device input and that's a pretty simple right.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:52.480">And, then what else do we need to we need to player device a you need</p>
      <p begin="00:41:52.480" end="00:41:56.800">to file input node to play a recording dot mpthree?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:56.800" end="00:42:00.030">In this case we're going to make...funky and...twinkle,</p>

      <p begin="00:42:09.420" end="00:42:12.860">We're going to see if we can get somebody that knows</p>
      <p begin="00:42:12.860" end="00:42:15.760">the song so the real audio</p>
      <p begin="00:42:15.760" end="00:42:20.680">...part is the last two lines the first two lines you open the storage find their standard aps that you guys</p>

      <p begin="00:42:33.530" end="00:42:43.170">file into...like we talked about so we're going to...file output node.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:43.170" end="00:42:48.050">That's it the first-line creates the storage file and then the second part</p>
      <p begin="00:42:48.050" end="00:42:51.410">and the third part actually is the audio graphical pretty simple</p>
      <p begin="00:42:51.410" end="00:42:55.410">right is anybody everybody with me so far anybody did I lose.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:55.410" end="00:42:59.390">...is enough so you'll notice here ...created recording</p>
      <p begin="00:42:59.390" end="00:43:03.600">that wave but that's not what we talk about we talked about creating recording and</p>
      <p begin="00:43:03.600" end="00:43:08.550">mpthree the default option for audio graft saves to recording at wave so we're going</p>
      <p begin="00:43:08.550" end="00:43:13.530">to mpthree over here by changing the filename isn't enough?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:13.530" end="00:43:24.510">So, we're going to create.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:24.510" end="00:43:30.180">...going to do this.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:30.180" end="00:43:31.890">These are.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:31.890" end="00:43:36.480">For aps already exists.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:42.450">That's it that's all you need to create an mpthree file you wanted to create a...or you wanted to create a</p>
      <p begin="00:43:42.450" end="00:43:46.290">wm a file but if you want to change the encoding properties you just</p>
      <p begin="00:43:46.290" end="00:43:51.870">...and customize the your profile that's all you need to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:51.870" end="00:43:54.560">And, then we're mostly done right what else is left the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:54.560" end="00:44:04.920">submits node so we need to create the submits node which is literally one-line.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:04.920" end="00:44:08.340">That's it creates a mix not boom but then this doesn't create</p>
      <p begin="00:44:08.340" end="00:44:12.000">...input...incoming and outgoing connection so we're going to just create</p>
      <p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:19.890">and input outgoing connections we're going to wire them up.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:19.890" end="00:44:22.340">So, you have for...it has to inputs...</p>
      <p begin="00:44:22.340" end="00:44:27.260">outputs the numbers that you see over there is the gain.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:27.260" end="00:44:32.160">So, in this case the microphone I want to push up again so I can actually hear my own</p>
      <p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:37.010">weiss above the backing track which is why the phili input has</p>
      <p begin="00:44:37.010" end="00:44:44.000">...suppress the gain of...zero-point-five whereas the mike of...high and...five-point-zero.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:44.000" end="00:44:46.990">And, then I'm going to create a custom effect</p>
      <p begin="00:44:46.990" end="00:44:50.500">that jason talked about using a basic audio</p>
      <p begin="00:44:50.500" end="00:44:55.330">...that in this case I'm not going to do a full spectrum analyzer</p>
      <p begin="00:44:55.330" end="00:44:59.540">instead all I'm doing is looking at the volume of the signal and returning the decibel</p>
      <p begin="00:44:59.540" end="00:45:03.710">value that represent visual we're...going to the implementation of the</p>
      <p begin="00:45:03.710" end="00:45:14.870">code over here but we will discuss that in the st samples.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:14.870" end="00:45:23.150">And, let's see if this compiles.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:23.150" end="00:45:26.200">And,...compiling do I have a volunteer for somebody to come and</p>
      <p begin="00:45:26.200" end="00:45:33.540">seeing this with me anyone all right, come on, up.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:33.540" end="00:45:35.580">...everybody...</p>
      <p begin="00:45:37.130" end="00:45:38.410">All right.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:38.410" end="00:45:41.480">So, we're going to use this microphone...intuit.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:41.480" end="00:45:44.970">So, let's wait and to compiles, compiles, compiles.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:46.170" end="00:45:59.760">All right.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:59.760" end="00:46:00.960">All right moi.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:07.880" end="00:46:15.890">World so.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:15.890" end="00:46:20.730">Okay, everybody given behind the mouth.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:20.730" end="00:46:21.980">...I told</p>
      <p begin="00:46:21.980" end="00:46:26.280">you were going to have a party over here so let's see where it actually recorded</p>
      <p begin="00:46:26.280" end="00:46:31.150">it recorded in the music folder you have your recording dot mpthree</p>
      <p begin="00:46:31.150" end="00:46:31.650">overhear.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:32.830" end="00:46:46.250">...double-click this and make sure that...actually place.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:46.250" end="00:46:48.570">You guys see...</p>
      <p begin="00:46:50.090" end="00:46:52.380">...was fun wasn't.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:52.380" end="00:46:55.900">It's all this is all great.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:55.900" end="00:46:57.490">So, let's.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:57.490" end="00:47:03.010">What we haven't covered is we're doing a kind?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:03.010" end="00:47:08.150">We're running a little shards so we're going to skip the custom effects that we're going to have the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:08.150" end="00:47:09.870">...the audio</p>
      <p begin="00:47:09.870" end="00:47:17.740">...provides let me just run you guys to a quick simple echo effect let me show you the code.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:17.740" end="00:47:19.460">So, all they do is create and</p>
      <p begin="00:47:19.460" end="00:47:23.440">...definition and I have parameters and I just added to my</p>
      <p begin="00:47:23.440" end="00:47:27.170">...node a by default its enabler and I don't want</p>
      <p begin="00:47:27.170" end="00:47:31.190">to enable unless I click on a button to actually say enable this effect so I go</p>
      <p begin="00:47:31.190" end="00:47:38.350">ahead and disabled...I have...you why...click...to...and.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:38.350" end="00:47:44.960">This is...great so let's move to this.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:49.590">the karaoke...fun but there is one part that we</p>
      <p begin="00:47:49.590" end="00:47:54.980">...talked about...say latency was important for a karaoke upward really</p>
      <p begin="00:47:54.980" end="00:47:59.680">haven't discussed how or why we address latency first</p>
      <p begin="00:47:59.680" end="00:48:05.050">let me go a little bit deeper into the topic of latency because this requires some level of</p>
      <p begin="00:48:05.050" end="00:48:09.270">detail and I want to make sure that you guys realize all of the work when the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:09.270" end="00:48:14.040">microsoft has done in this area four-wheel for latency?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:14.040" end="00:48:18.040">First we heard a lot of feedback...latency is very important for interactive</p>
      <p begin="00:48:18.040" end="00:48:22.930">audio scenarios and just any kind of audio scenario in general for the pro audio</p>
      <p begin="00:48:22.930" end="00:48:27.950">creative professionals...lot-of feedback we've taken this seriously and we have done a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:48:27.950" end="00:48:31.610">work in windows tend to reduce latency typical numbers,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:31.610" end="00:48:36.740">for example, like device like the surface pro tree in windows eight-point one used to</p>
      <p begin="00:48:36.740" end="00:48:41.540">...milliseconds round-trip we'll talk a little bit in a couple of minutes about</p>
      <p begin="00:48:41.540" end="00:48:44.920">what...fifteen milliseconds means and when you upgraded</p>
      <p begin="00:48:44.920" end="00:48:49.680">to windows can you will get a round-trip millie a latency of about ten</p>
      <p begin="00:48:49.680" end="00:48:55.070">milliseconds this is a you should get similar numbers on your hp specter</p>
      <p begin="00:48:55.070" end="00:49:00.010">that-you received today as well this will obviously depend on the device and the diverse</p>
      <p begin="00:49:00.010" end="00:49:03.700">will get into a little bit of details in a couple of minutes what why?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:03.700" end="00:49:06.660">So, let's bring them time talking about what the fifty milliseconds</p>
      <p begin="00:49:06.660" end="00:49:10.010">is first there are two large</p>
      <p begin="00:49:10.010" end="00:49:15.780">sector categories of latency that most people talk about the first one is touch to sound</p>
      <p begin="00:49:15.780" end="00:49:19.470">...sound is the time you hear the argue from the moment</p>
      <p begin="00:49:19.470" end="00:49:21.380">to touch your touch-screen.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:21.380" end="00:49:26.030">The second part is a round-trip latency round-trip latency is when you</p>
      <p begin="00:49:26.030" end="00:49:30.110">have a microphone you sing...the audio flows through the capture</p>
      <p begin="00:49:30.110" end="00:49:34.120">stack into the audio engine and then...flows back through the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:34.120" end="00:49:39.000">...part of the speakers and it's the time you...into</p>
      <p begin="00:49:39.000" end="00:49:43.930">the microphone to the time you hear yourself and this is the part that we're going to be concentrating on</p>
      <p begin="00:49:43.930" end="00:49:48.590">this session because that's more related audio we're not going to...stack.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:48.590" end="00:49:53.130">So, since I talk about the audio stuff let me paint you picture of what the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:53.130" end="00:49:57.470">audio subsystem looks like this is how audio looks like</p>
      <p begin="00:49:57.470" end="00:50:02.390">on windows where you have the application on top you have the hardware and the bottom you have the audio engine that</p>
      <p begin="00:50:02.390" end="00:50:08.310">...in between and...doctor each other with buffers the buffers are standard</p>
      <p begin="00:50:08.310" end="00:50:14.120">is our ten millisecond buffered that you used to communicate between each other the majority of the work that we've</p>
      <p begin="00:50:14.120" end="00:50:17.920">done in windows terror a huge amount of work that we put into the argue engine has been to</p>
      <p begin="00:50:17.920" end="00:50:22.920">re architect and redesign the audio engine that on the exact same hardware you will get a minimum</p>
      <p begin="00:50:22.920" end="00:50:26.420">of fifteen milliseconds the savings in the round-trip</p>
      <p begin="00:50:26.420" end="00:50:31.270">scenario but what we have also done is enabled support for smaller</p>
      <p begin="00:50:31.270" end="00:50:36.050">buffers smaller buffers means that each layer has to wait less for the other</p>
      <p begin="00:50:36.050" end="00:50:41.520">layer-two handed data and this obviously requires hardware support and therefore device</p>
      <p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:46.180">driver support so we've enabled new methods for the device to</p>
      <p begin="00:50:46.180" end="00:50:50.330">announce these capabilities to the audio engine and then application can then query</p>
      <p begin="00:50:50.330" end="00:50:55.210">these capability aim to be audio engine to figure out what kind-of for</p>
      <p begin="00:50:55.210" end="00:51:00.850">support happens on that particular device all of this is great.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:00.850" end="00:51:04.280">But, we still haven't talked about hoping use latency in audio</p>
      <p begin="00:51:04.280" end="00:51:08.880">graph...all of this is...it takes like a million lines of code to use low latency</p>
      <p begin="00:51:08.880" end="00:51:12.920">autograph right so let me just jump back to visual studio for</p>
      <p begin="00:51:12.920" end="00:51:17.910">a quick second to show you exactly how many lines of code it is.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:17.910" end="00:51:21.050">To use low latency audio graph.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:21.050" end="00:51:27.590">You remember those settings object be created to create the audio graph.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:27.590" end="00:51:32.450">All we need to do here is say's settings dot.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:32.450" end="00:51:35.740">Quantum size selection mode and we have to say quantum say</p>
      <p begin="00:51:35.740" end="00:51:40.060">selection more dot...latency that's a...</p>
      <p begin="00:51:40.060" end="00:51:44.600">line of code that is all it takes to go into the lowest latency more than that particular</p>
      <p begin="00:51:44.600" end="00:51:49.700">hardware device so if I now recompile this hardware this karaoke app that</p>
      <p begin="00:51:49.700" end="00:51:54.120">...have on this particular hardware you will hear an even lower latency</p>
      <p begin="00:51:54.120" end="00:51:58.990">although that's mostly more obvious for the person singing...because for the person hearing you don't really know</p>
      <p begin="00:51:58.990" end="00:52:03.850">when them all the words...smart sowe're going to skip the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:03.850" end="00:52:10.670">...particular demo of...and...move back into our point.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:10.670" end="00:52:14.810">...so, that's all of the work that we did inwindows</p>
      <p begin="00:52:14.810" end="00:52:17.740">ten for audio and.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:17.740" end="00:52:22.660">If nothing else we want you to remember these top points when you guys</p>
      <p begin="00:52:22.660" end="00:52:25.830">need to them because we covered a...the first we want you do</p>
      <p begin="00:52:25.830" end="00:52:31.090">remember reducing talked about for media composition...was introduced in windows</p>
      <p begin="00:52:31.090" end="00:52:35.320">for a pipeline we bring this into the universal windows platform we</p>
      <p begin="00:52:35.320" end="00:52:41.250">increased performance as well as we have additional...capabilities like</p>
      <p begin="00:52:41.250" end="00:52:45.980">...and overlays and the other stuff we talk about today is</p>
      <p begin="00:52:45.980" end="00:52:47.040">maybe?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:47.040" end="00:52:51.790">We looked at a very core demo of how many runs in the universal windows platform using raspy</p>
      <p begin="00:52:51.790" end="00:52:54.400">...as an example and we also introduced a</p>
      <p begin="00:52:54.400" end="00:52:58.740">brand-new api for interactive audio applications called audio...</p>
      <p begin="00:52:58.740" end="00:53:04.080">And, we introduced low latency argue...the work that we did in there I want to say that low</p>
      <p begin="00:53:04.080" end="00:53:08.550">latency is a complicated topic and it's a very deep topic so we didn't really do justice</p>
      <p begin="00:53:08.550" end="00:53:13.310">overhear to cover all of the details we will be...a white paper with a</p>
      <p begin="00:53:13.310" end="00:53:18.240">lot of details on all the work that we did in low latency and what how you can use it in audio...and</p>
      <p begin="00:53:18.240" end="00:53:20.990">...copy and all of the different goodness is how you can</p>
      <p begin="00:53:20.990" end="00:53:25.630">query the driver to figure out of the stuff that it better</p>

      <p begin="00:53:30.890" end="00:53:35.670">the creative media experiences angle is receiving a lot of coverage there's</p>
      <p begin="00:53:35.670" end="00:53:40.990">...news to come in the keynote...which I think you guys would really like?</p>
