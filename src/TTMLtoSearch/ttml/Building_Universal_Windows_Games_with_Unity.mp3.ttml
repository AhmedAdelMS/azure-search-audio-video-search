      <p begin="00:00:03.970" end="00:00:05.220">Welcome,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:05.220" end="00:00:09.760">welcome, welcome...has pop-up...redoing.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.760" end="00:00:14.360">Good...more people answered expected answered at five o'clock in the day so thank you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.360" end="00:00:17.900">very much for coming my name is average hooper ame technically managers</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.900" end="00:00:23.500">...microsoft working out of southern california I do a lot on the gaming side I came</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.500" end="00:00:28.540">from enterprise background and about two years ago by accident somebody hack upon mentioned something about unity</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.540" end="00:00:33.340">who knows about the dependency injection software unity right and that's what I thought they were talking about and I found</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.340" end="00:00:36.730">...whole game engine out there and that change my career so things happen</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.730" end="00:00:45.930">...crazy way here don't forget the some evaluation that's important to all...especially myself?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.930" end="00:00:51.940">We're going to be doing and overview of unity how many people are using unity currently you folks</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.940" end="00:00:56.080">third folks article...to do it...overview this is not can be an</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.080" end="00:00:59.310">...session although for the folks...uni</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.310" end="00:01:04.110">...a couple basing points and asher not totally lost looking at the interface and what we're doing</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.110" end="00:01:07.830">tooling where microsoft fits in on a tooling story with unity?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.830" end="00:01:12.640">And, universal windows apps and universal windows platform talk about how we can build for that from unity</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.640" end="00:01:19.700">...some cross device strategies and where we're going a little bit of a roadmap?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.700" end="00:01:24.640">So, unity and visual studio my two favorite software products.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.640" end="00:01:29.250">...five is the recent version where they may some really cool announcements outside</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.250" end="00:01:34.050">...support they change the licensing model on there so if you get the free version or the pro</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.050" end="00:01:38.510">version they have the same basic feature set ninety nine-point nine inine the same feature set</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.510" end="00:01:42.850">pro gives you some additional cloud-based services analytics build et-cetera so,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.850" end="00:01:48.000">my favorite features I'll just talk about real quick here animation if you have any sort of character</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:51.380">...for example, let's say you have the zombie that...bought</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.380" end="00:01:56.010">...which I'll talk about or designer created for you can take any animation maybe somebody shooting</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.010" end="00:02:00.760">and aero or somebody doing zombie walk where I've seen one literally in...game I saw...doing</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.760" end="00:02:05.980">...them style dance you can take those animations and apply them to any other character and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:05.980" end="00:02:12.040">...animations the graphics engine was revamping...changes their to give essentially triple a</p>
      <p begin="00:02:12.040" end="00:02:16.980">quality highlighting and your games optimizing they've got a profiler</p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.980" end="00:02:21.350">built-in unity as well as a framed bagger now as well as the audio system</p>
      <p begin="00:02:21.350" end="00:02:26.030">unity was also revamping five and now they have a audio mixer and tutti</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.030" end="00:02:30.730">and three-d physics they use to very well-known engines out there and, there are other products</p>
      <p begin="00:02:30.730" end="00:02:36.450">...as well box tutti and in...and video physics...that allows you</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.450" end="00:02:40.600">to have hundreds of physics objects in your scenes things bouncing around</p>
      <p begin="00:02:40.600" end="00:02:44.620">cloudy with each other so very high-performance...five things you couldn't do in the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.620" end="00:02:53.100">prior for versions and from scripting standpoint support csharp and that's all I care about.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.100" end="00:02:59.560">The first image here's an example you can see...aaa quality demo they put out there that characters</p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.560" end="00:03:04.570">...animation system the second time the global illumination system gi that's including now</p>
      <p begin="00:03:04.570" end="00:03:08.580">and unity five the third screen shot there is from the profiler you want to look at</p>
      <p begin="00:03:08.580" end="00:03:12.100">the memory analysis and...call things like that you can all do that</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.100" end="00:03:20.230">...unity and lastly...two-d tools which will look at a little bit later on as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:20.230" end="00:03:24.520">Is unity right for you and there's one reason I show this slide</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.520" end="00:03:26.830">...has a forty five percent market share the next</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.830" end="00:03:30.800">...competitor seventeen percent and I want to be a</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.800" end="00:03:35.110">sales I'm I want to be from developer standpoint I develop something I...support</p>
      <p begin="00:03:35.110" end="00:03:39.300">...for there's a large community using a particular product a our millions</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.300" end="00:03:44.170">...developers using uni and almost any question you ask to find...a very stack overflowed type format</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.170" end="00:03:48.940">or forums and our people info download etc...almost any question you can go</p>
      <p begin="00:03:48.940" end="00:03:55.330">and search on...somebody's already ask before and if not there's a great community help you out?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:55.330" end="00:04:06.020">All right let's get right into a demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.020" end="00:04:11.780">And, let's not be and presenter mode let's go and duplicate my screen.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:11.780" end="00:04:14.420">Do jumping jacks and you can see it?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14.420" end="00:04:17.370">Hi, yes, anything anybody was going to thank you.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.450" end="00:04:23.340">All right so this...what we're going to create...how we can kind of...and together before we do other things like</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.340" end="00:04:27.760">...into platform so this is a fun game idea to start a fairly recently called</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.760" end="00:04:28.800">metal warfare.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:30.050" end="00:04:35.920">I have...for that.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:35.920" end="00:04:38.380">So, this is...warfare your tank.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.380" end="00:04:41.550">Driver tank and you can do fun things like</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.550" end="00:04:45.660">...the around and...this stuff.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.660" end="00:04:49.640">Because that's what really happens in real-life.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.640" end="00:04:50.140">Samoa.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:52.450" end="00:04:56.870">You get the idea there's a timer counting down you have two minutes or its doom and a little</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.870" end="00:05:00.740">...counter it's a fairly.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:00.740" end="00:05:06.400">Decent looking game although from a standpoint is actually fairly simple.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:10.130">And, it might look like...complex so what kind of kind...deconstruct this a little bit</p>
      <p begin="00:05:10.130" end="00:05:15.900">and see how we can actually build this up so do that let's start with another instance of humanly have open</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.900" end="00:05:22.050">here I'll just show you kind of steps I...get here and just...file new project.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.050" end="00:05:26.280">My...demo you may supports to dem three-d is a three-d engines so even</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.280" end="00:05:30.600">...two games are really three-d environment is just fixing...to axis wire developing</p>
      <p begin="00:05:30.600" end="00:05:34.190">...pop in and out of that so it's very easy to make a two-point-five the game,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.190" end="00:05:36.370">for example, where you mix three-d...missing?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:37.410" end="00:05:39.610">...my...on my demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:39.610" end="00:05:44.890">Create project but before we do that there's also this box here and when I first arguing</p>
      <p begin="00:05:44.890" end="00:05:48.750">development want to check everything off...I...they did and don't do that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.750" end="00:05:53.520">...thought the only the same...these think of them is a new get packages in a senses</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:57.590">...package functionality you can bring your game some?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:57.590" end="00:06:02.950">Get install my...default right there and you can...from anywhere if you download stuff...the access or will show you</p>
      <p begin="00:06:02.950" end="00:06:06.890">...shortly those come down as...packages I have a folder I keep all my favorite</p>
      <p begin="00:06:06.890" end="00:06:11.520">unique packages and they're just essentially compress files lots of functionality can be audio</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.520" end="00:06:14.800">scripts images three-d models all package japanese</p>
      <p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:19.220">...little bundles so just for this one's to show you how we started building it...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:19.220" end="00:06:24.320">check-off environment and the environment package brings in some things like trees usually five now use this</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24.320" end="00:06:28.860">been tree system awesome tree system also use in movies and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:28.860" end="00:06:32.860">...some images I can use the kind of texture...little bit and that's all I did but just</p>
      <p begin="00:06:32.860" end="00:06:36.620">to save time I will cancel that out and...show you?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.620" end="00:06:39.140">The next step out of there.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:39.140" end="00:06:44.270">Now...interface again this is intrude unity...do want to kinda talk about the interface or some folks</p>
      <p begin="00:06:44.270" end="00:06:47.250">argue...here this is your virtual environment here this is</p>
      <p begin="00:06:47.250" end="00:06:51.520">...level this is your...is we're going to your design...of unity.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:51.520" end="00:06:51.780">Think</p>
      <p begin="00:06:51.780" end="00:06:58.430">about work on a form like an example designer something everything here this is what's in your scene.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.430" end="00:07:00.550">And, over here on the properties what's</p>
      <p begin="00:07:00.550" end="00:07:04.680">you're seeing now everything ninety nine-point nine percent of everything stems</p>
      <p begin="00:07:04.680" end="00:07:09.460">...game object just like...is not object net right ninety nine-point</p>
      <p begin="00:07:09.460" end="00:07:13.650">you say that again for third-time they...nine percent of things in dot net I'm here from system the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.650" end="00:07:18.950">object think about game object as a root object for almost everything else it has a basic naming</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.950" end="00:07:24.450">has a tag just like in visual studio or when you're doing windows former...development...tags something</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.450" end="00:07:29.430">is...texturing...can use...describe something we can find something my tag?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:29.430" end="00:07:33.360">So, name a tag and transform where'd isn't space.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:33.360" end="00:07:36.480">You can move things around...equates to these buttons</p>
      <p begin="00:07:36.480" end="00:07:40.540">...toolbar as well now everything else after that are components everything comes to life</p>
      <p begin="00:07:40.540" end="00:07:45.310">by components if I look at a light is nothing more than a game object</p>
      <p begin="00:07:45.310" end="00:07:48.830">that these properties and got this like component on top of their if I look at</p>
      <p begin="00:07:48.830" end="00:07:52.980">the camera is also a game object has a camera components what turns</p>
      <p begin="00:07:52.980" end="00:07:58.120">new camera when you add a script gets added as a component two-game object if I look at</p>
      <p begin="00:07:58.120" end="00:08:00.870">...for example, a cuba's a game object</p>
      <p begin="00:08:00.870" end="00:08:05.840">...got a mesh filter which is responsible for reading the vertices...the model and passing out over to this thing called</p>
      <p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:12.030">...measure under which makes it visible or invisible your see the...games we have this invisible border the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:12.030" end="00:08:14.740">...me like I wonder how...that.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:15.780" end="00:08:20.150">Invisible mortar that's exactly what happens.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:20.150" end="00:08:22.560">...so let's look at some of the built-in functional</p>
      <p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:27.030">...is not a three-d modeling system asterisks because they do have some tools built-in you can</p>
      <p begin="00:08:27.030" end="00:08:30.250">do some three-d modeling and there's third-party tools like...for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30.250" end="00:08:35.240">we can actually do modeling inside unity but...one of the built-in systems here since I use it to build-out that</p>
      <p begin="00:08:35.240" end="00:08:38.360">...game and that's the terrain...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:38.360" end="00:08:43.140">...a new terrain and comes out is...here I want to textured I want to add image on</p>
      <p begin="00:08:43.140" end="00:08:47.360">to that terrain and that's what this paintbrush here's for so I...my train I get</p>
      <p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:49.730">...components a game object with some other components</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.730" end="00:08:52.720">here and I click on the paintbrush.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:52.720" end="00:08:59.480">I can add...texture in other words I can take an image in plastered all over there so I'm going to add a texture here and...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:59.480" end="00:09:05.390">And, if I search for ground or grass there's a couple basic ones...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:05.390" end="00:09:08.910">First one gets applied goes all over the entire surface so you can</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.910" end="00:09:13.260">see it's repeatable how do you change that a real-world environment</p>
      <p begin="00:09:13.260" end="00:09:17.980">when we solve this game right here if you get close sometimes some things look repeatable by</p>
      <p begin="00:09:17.980" end="00:09:22.940">mixing it up by...different textures on top of you can see here about some sand there's a...texture there's</p>
      <p begin="00:09:22.940" end="00:09:29.320">...little...the green texture so my randomized in your terrain things look a little bit different.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:29.320" end="00:09:31.960">Now we need to...this out that's nothing we can do with our</p>
      <p begin="00:09:31.960" end="00:09:36.060">...tools here the first one raise or lower terrain and I think this is like my favorite</p>
      <p begin="00:09:36.060" end="00:09:40.550">...because you can do cool things like this.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:40.550" end="00:09:43.390">Start drawing stuff out.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:43.390" end="00:09:43.560">If you</p>
      <p begin="00:09:43.560" end="00:09:48.570">want paint something like a plateau or mesa specific.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:49.740" end="00:09:52.040">Was a little high.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:52.040" end="00:09:56.610">Windows up you can actually use notes...come in any road them down a little bit more</p>
      <p begin="00:09:56.610" end="00:10:01.300">...of some of these are very like a very jagged not realistic looking so can</p>

      <p begin="00:10:12.260" end="00:10:16.580">also straight and just like that we have a basic terrain of course I would want to take other images</p>
      <p begin="00:10:16.580" end="00:10:18.480">in plaster on there but that's how you stop</p>
      <p begin="00:10:18.480" end="00:10:23.440">...take a bunch of images plastered on top of their and painted and</p>

      <p begin="00:10:35.610" end="00:10:42.750">...trees...environment packed we broaden gives us a couple trees.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:42.750" end="00:10:46.580">those and I can...a big area but let's be sparing.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:47.730" end="00:10:49.150">From california there's not much</p>

      <p begin="00:10:58.200" end="00:11:00.920">That's what happens or my favorite button of all time mass place trees</p>
      <p begin="00:11:00.920" end="00:11:05.530">...give thousand trees there we go so just like that we can do</p>
      <p begin="00:11:05.530" end="00:11:08.770">grass we can paint rocks on...we can do all these other different textures.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:10.230" end="00:11:14.950">Those are built-in tools newly we saw the game we actually had more than just that involved</p>
      <p begin="00:11:14.950" end="00:11:20.310">so that kind of brought me over to the...store I was...architecture many years before joining microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:11:20.310" end="00:11:24.610">and I can draw means stick figure and that's about it so if I want to create a game</p>
      <p begin="00:11:24.610" end="00:11:29.210">...somewhat cool then I go ahead and grab stuff...store I know</p>

      <p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:13.950">on so in making out ...warfare the...game I showed you</p>
      <p begin="00:12:13.950" end="00:12:19.250">the beginning I grab a couple packs of the as a store I guess audio aggravating...action</p>

      <p begin="00:12:28.340" end="00:12:30.220">So, I took that terrain.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:30.220" end="00:12:35.410">And, just kind of changed a little bit abroad some...can kind of see here took</p>
      <p begin="00:12:35.410" end="00:12:40.320">a couple different images...that up but now the magic happens in the rest of it so we have</p>
      <p begin="00:12:40.320" end="00:12:45.010">a basic terrain here some concrete on side of their.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:45.010" end="00:12:46.050">Next was taking.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:47.140" end="00:12:48.880">Some of these prefabricated,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:53.690">prefabricated objects that you can just take...you're seeing you can make your improve abs and</p>
      <p begin="00:12:53.690" end="00:12:58.520">unity literally you take something from here and you dragging down there...becomes prefabricated you can reuse it across</p>
      <p begin="00:12:58.520" end="00:13:04.140">...these prefabricated that this designer said hey I want to give you reusable bits of information so these</p>
      <p begin="00:13:04.140" end="00:13:08.010">...prefabricated and if we want...iraq, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:08.010" end="00:13:12.010">take a...there of course stacking as up side-by-side look a little bit goofy</p>
      <p begin="00:13:12.010" end="00:13:15.520">so it's all about randomized placing environment</p>
      <p begin="00:13:15.520" end="00:13:19.740">randomized anything's scaling up scaling down a little bit.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:19.740" end="00:13:24.590">Randomized...so...there we take.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:24.590" end="00:13:28.990">...hangar.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:28.990" end="00:13:34.270">Couple guard towers...focus look at those look all right and it's all about just taken kind</p>
      <p begin="00:13:34.270" end="00:13:39.660">of the minute details...we can dragged big things around what about little things...fence, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:39.660" end="00:13:44.090">framenet.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:44.090" end="00:13:46.690">So, you...the idea take objects snap together.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:47.900" end="00:13:51.940">Make these environment's that's about what it looks like there.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:51.940" end="00:13:58.820">The next step on there who was taking one of the other...I got.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:58.820" end="00:14:02.970">Prefabricated equals.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:02.970" end="00:14:07.600">...be clear I did write a little bit of code run I didn't quite like the way the operated this physics</p>
      <p begin="00:14:07.600" end="00:14:12.270">...so I want to change the functionality it was the first-person I one of the bagel ai</p>
      <p begin="00:14:12.270" end="00:14:15.590">into it...make a little...code changes on there.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:15.590" end="00:14:18.550">But, it did work out-of-the-box so.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:18.550" end="00:14:31.200">You can see how this level here actually looks pretty similar to the one that I showed you beginning here.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:31.200" end="00:14:34.230">That's what we've got our tank there.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:34.230" end="00:14:38.680">We've got a helicopter also but as a pack.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:38.680" end="00:14:43.670">I got a script that actually will piece apart your matches and read-only versus industry that when you</p>
      <p begin="00:14:43.670" end="00:14:47.900">...whether...do...so using all the powerfully asked our kind of create</p>
      <p begin="00:14:47.900" end="00:14:58.870">a game here and ...designer to do a little bit of work which I'll talk about just a tiny bit here.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:58.870" end="00:15:03.320">So, we've got this game.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:03.320" end="00:15:05.440">Let's talk about some of the tooling that we have</p>
      <p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:14.540">to make things a little bit easier for the game developer for somebody using unity here.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:14.540" end="00:15:19.430">We purchased...a company called syntax tree within the last year and they had a product</p>
      <p begin="00:15:19.430" end="00:15:21.550">called unity vs and was to</p>
      <p begin="00:15:21.550" end="00:15:25.990">use unity with visual studio and was about a hundred plug-in that you</p>
      <p begin="00:15:25.990" end="00:15:30.940">...unity I know a lot of folks that love...they...it but also cost a hundred bucks so we bought them and we</p>
      <p begin="00:15:30.940" end="00:15:33.260">turn-around we made this product free.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:33.260" end="00:15:37.080">And, this allows you use visual studio to edit debug code the fall</p>
      <p begin="00:15:37.080" end="00:15:43.670">is model develop and we use visual studio...probably...and most people.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:43.670" end="00:15:47.400">So, this allows you use visual studio to not only edit but also to debug your coding</p>
      <p begin="00:15:47.400" end="00:15:53.610">...will look at surely this makes...to integrate together pretty seamlessly.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:53.610" end="00:15:57.520">This gives you shaver syntax highlighting intel sense like you'd expect</p>
      <p begin="00:15:57.520" end="00:16:01.370">...id...code template...my favorite features of that and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:01.370" end="00:16:06.180">...debugging support with unity you can use any text...want you just can't</p>
      <p begin="00:16:06.180" end="00:16:12.710">debug your code out-of-the-box works among developed this allows you now you visual studio to debug your code.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:12.710" end="00:16:16.660">So, what happens...plug-in...installing visual studio you</p>
      <p begin="00:16:16.660" end="00:16:20.360">...package into your game and two-one uses the existing</p>
      <p begin="00:16:20.360" end="00:16:24.930">...that model develop uses to talk back and forth there's a soft debug that</p>
      <p begin="00:16:24.930" end="00:16:28.280">...uses and allows you talk back and forth between visual</p>
      <p begin="00:16:28.280" end="00:16:34.220">studio use the same underlying mechanism that...developed...as well?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:34.220" end="00:16:35.940">Anybody here about this.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:35.940" end="00:16:40.430">The partnership for tools...work with unity</p>
      <p begin="00:16:40.430" end="00:16:44.520">and visual studio community addition is going to be an option during install,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:44.520" end="00:16:48.510">install for unity and some other tools as well where during</p>
      <p begin="00:16:48.510" end="00:16:53.630">setup click quick...visual studio community addition as your...going to work very seamlessly</p>
      <p begin="00:16:53.630" end="00:17:00.930">...well you can use model developers wealthy...but I'm a visual studio get.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:00.930" end="00:17:04.580">All right let's look at what that looks like.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:04.580" end="00:17:14.009">...the partnership happen because I think this is one of the cools tools.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:14.009" end="00:17:18.189">You can look for visual studio tools...st you folks call it you can also go to</p>

      <p begin="00:17:26.229" end="00:17:31.199">for you installs and asset package like us talk about earlier unity package that</p>
      <p begin="00:17:31.199" end="00:17:39.370">you can see so let's look at what that looks like let's take this basic one that we did before.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:39.370" end="00:17:42.690">And, under assets import package we can always</p>
      <p begin="00:17:42.690" end="00:17:46.150">bringing those little check boxes that I show you the beginning that new project...we always bring</p>
      <p begin="00:17:46.150" end="00:17:51.080">...later at any time we can either use these we can double-click on one our system we don't have</p>
      <p begin="00:17:51.080" end="00:17:55.230">to uses I just...see that the visual studio tools freely installs here</p>
      <p begin="00:17:55.230" end="00:17:59.240">...listed as visual studio twenty fifteen tools click on that</p>
      <p begin="00:17:59.240" end="00:18:04.060">...tells you a this is what inside let-you package file and there's just these two libraries</p>
      <p begin="00:18:04.060" end="00:18:07.080">...import that.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:07.080" end="00:18:10.040">That's it done.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.040" end="00:18:13.360">And, you menu peers up here generate project file you typically don't have to click that this</p>

      <p begin="00:18:35.220" end="00:18:40.610">Let's go ahead and create a csharp script here.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:40.610" end="00:18:43.890">We will make let's making evil cube.</p>

      <p begin="00:21:24.250" end="00:21:27.710">So, if we want to debug this we just click that.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:27.710" end="00:21:33.090">I'll show you that one second we need...more background work here I'm saying by colliding the player</p>
      <p begin="00:21:33.090" end="00:21:38.130">destroyed what we have...assigned this code...let's do a real basic example here and</p>
      <p begin="00:21:38.130" end="00:21:40.910">...create a game object...cubed.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:41.970" end="00:21:47.220">...put that one.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:47.220" end="00:21:53.100">Will duplicate that cubed and move this guy up so we're going to...them?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:53.100" end="00:21:57.440">In order to fall we need to given object a rigid body component</p>
      <p begin="00:21:57.440" end="00:22:00.340">using unity you're very familiar that you...object</p>
      <p begin="00:22:00.340" end="00:22:05.030">mass and gravity you simply give it rigid body and we'll see it fall now the codes</p>
      <p begin="00:22:05.030" end="00:22:10.820">...yet...that's go ahead and take that code.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:10.820" end="00:22:15.870">Give that to our...</p>
      <p begin="00:22:15.870" end="00:22:17.470">And, let's make the.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:18.580" end="00:22:25.690">Top cube the player just a tag assist a string were signing to it.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:25.690" end="00:22:31.280">All right that's go ahead and debug code attached unity.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:31.280" end="00:22:38.240">All right we come over here and that's go ahead and play.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:38.240" end="00:22:41.740">Boom soon as the object collided we get thrown the</p>
      <p begin="00:22:41.740" end="00:22:46.750">visual studio unity is actually hung up right now because it's we're in the middle</p>
      <p begin="00:22:46.750" end="00:22:52.120">debug call right now so if we want to continue this we can just either...continue</p>
      <p begin="00:22:52.120" end="00:22:58.100">...cc and all the same debugging exist here if you want to do if...want to see all your watches.</p>

      <p begin="00:23:11.540" end="00:23:15.870">The other thing that the visual studio tools really gives you.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:15.870" end="00:23:19.750">Is...syntax highlighting?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:19.750" end="00:23:23.890">So, just let-me easy on the eyes of your writing...a custom...just to get the syntax highlighting</p>
      <p begin="00:23:23.890" end="00:23:27.270">...there so another nice little feature there.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:27.270" end="00:23:31.220">When you're done you just click stop you don't have to detachment process...not going to kill</p>

      <p begin="00:23:40.760" end="00:23:44.950">All right so that was cool...unity and the next thing we have</p>
      <p begin="00:23:44.950" end="00:23:48.670">our diagnostics and you can use the visual</p>
      <p begin="00:23:48.670" end="00:23:53.740">studio graphics debugging for diagnostics gives you some really low-level information...typically want to</p>

      <p begin="00:24:00.520" end="00:24:04.900">And, this will give you the ability capture one or multiple frames low-level debugging</p>
      <p begin="00:24:04.900" end="00:24:09.610">...will take a will look...little example of this but very important point this</p>

      <p begin="00:36:57.400" end="00:36:59.910">really, really important...on different display sizes</p>
      <p begin="00:36:59.910" end="00:37:05.190">...simulator scale things out we're working on a game once and there's a</p>

      <p begin="00:37:24.220" end="00:37:30.530">So, thinking about other devices here talking about phone and...desktop.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:30.530" end="00:37:33.950">We have to consider crossed my strategies there's.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:33.950" end="00:37:38.730">A couple different ways to do this but we are...error now work you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:37:38.730" end="00:37:42.760">take one build...you can take one build and run it on a variety devices from</p>
      <p begin="00:37:42.760" end="00:37:47.580">development standpoint sometimes it's a lot easier to do that and have to do...build here seven build their</p>
      <p begin="00:37:47.580" end="00:37:51.670">...separate build there?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:51.670" end="00:37:52.210">The first thing</p>
      <p begin="00:37:52.210" end="00:37:56.880">...to look at is designing for different screens and there's tooling as built...of...that can help you</p>
      <p begin="00:37:56.880" end="00:38:01.760">...so multiple resolutions...aspect ratios different device</p>
      <p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:06.840">capabilities...run across the screen...sizing so we ran the games</p>
      <p begin="00:38:06.840" end="00:38:11.750">domingo saw that I took that window and dragnet expect users are not going to run</p>
      <p begin="00:38:11.750" end="00:38:16.450">...necessarily fix aspect ratio they're going to run...full-screen my window it that's up to the user</p>
      <p begin="00:38:16.450" end="00:38:22.730">to control so we can use a couple things don't...for this right now and we're working with them and integrating ongoing for</p>
      <p begin="00:38:22.730" end="00:38:25.690">...techniques here so unity</p>
      <p begin="00:38:25.690" end="00:38:30.370">ui which I'll show you a demo in a second is one way of doing this formally call-you gooey favor her</p>
      <p begin="00:38:30.370" end="00:38:34.500">...you do is now called unity ui user interface another technique you can use</p>
      <p begin="00:38:34.500" end="00:38:39.520">are called asset bundles as a...require a little bit more work to...but if you have,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:39.520" end="00:38:44.250">for example, a high-definition tank...the xbox and...low definition</p>
      <p begin="00:38:44.250" end="00:38:50.330">...uoneon mobile, for example, you basically sign them to different avce acid bundles</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50.330" end="00:38:55.930">...fone and then at runtime you upload you pulled...of the internet</p>
      <p begin="00:38:55.930" end="00:38:57.930">...source and the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:57.930" end="00:39:01.000">...built me unity to logos packages up such one</p>
      <p begin="00:39:01.000" end="00:39:06.770">technique doing that another one is a using a...cessna target</p>
      <p begin="00:39:06.770" end="00:39:17.430">multi-stream layouts so let's look at what I did hear for middle warfare.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:17.430" end="00:39:21.470">So, there's kind of the basic hub heads up display...was design there.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:21.470" end="00:39:27.980">That's coming to level here that doesn't have a basically duplicate that one took it back out.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.980" end="00:39:31.690">I talk to designer and I said hey work attain game what is your</p>
      <p begin="00:39:31.690" end="00:39:36.100">also artistic vision because I can do stick figures you better than me so what can you come up with...said</p>
      <p begin="00:39:36.100" end="00:39:41.080">...has like that that's great so much better and I can do so...the asses for that all</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.080" end="00:39:45.960">the samper ones and I brought them into my project for here.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:45.960" end="00:39:48.150">If I want to take this guy in</p>
      <p begin="00:39:48.150" end="00:39:53.810">...my...you know,...doesn't work quite like that there's this two-d...unity.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:53.810" end="00:39:59.120">And, underneath our game object menu ui we can create all these different elements that we've been able to make the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:59.120" end="00:40:04.270">comparison visual studio right panel buttons texts images slider scroll bar so</p>
      <p begin="00:40:04.270" end="00:40:08.640">all these different components you would think of these different ui elements you can do a lot of these</p>
      <p begin="00:40:08.640" end="00:40:15.730">inside of unity and credo custom one this system is an open-source system you can find code for eliminate.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:15.730" end="00:40:20.360">So, let's go ahead and do and image now clearly that's not what I want because I look at</p>
      <p begin="00:40:20.360" end="00:40:24.210">that images plastered great...display ship it</p>
      <p begin="00:40:24.210" end="00:40:28.020">...that's not what I want...on that particular image</p>
      <p begin="00:40:28.020" end="00:40:35.760">...take that top left image bringing over here and drop that guy on there?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:35.760" end="00:40:40.680">preserve aspect ratio because that's not what I want their presume aspect ratio.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:40.680" end="00:40:44.080">So, the thing I can do if you notice this box</p>
      <p begin="00:40:44.080" end="00:40:47.750">running my screen here this is representative of the current screen</p>
      <p begin="00:40:47.750" end="00:40:51.370">on notice as I change my window size.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:51.370" end="00:40:56.070">That changes so think of that is the boxes going to define the resolution</p>
      <p begin="00:40:56.070" end="00:40:58.850">a size the aspect ratio of whatever system you're running on whether</p>
      <p begin="00:40:58.850" end="00:41:03.860">to phone or like this system so this is a good way to test it out you can actually scale here and see how</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03.860" end="00:41:08.840">...changes so I bring this guy at the top left this is my top left-hand element and I</p>
      <p begin="00:41:08.840" end="00:41:14.680">go to my game tab here to see what would look like based on...first frame.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:14.680" end="00:41:19.090">As I start scaling notice that's not what I want the same disappears</p>
      <p begin="00:41:19.090" end="00:41:22.060">...see what's happening here if I go to the side.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:22.060" end="00:41:24.460">Is actually just getting pushed off that's because it's</p>
      <p begin="00:41:24.460" end="00:41:28.970">anchor point in the center the screen so everything is doing is relative to that point is</p>
      <p begin="00:41:28.970" end="00:41:32.010">...and fixed over there you move over I'm going to stay fix</p>
      <p begin="00:41:32.010" end="00:41:37.000">to that and just like we can visual studio can...different ui elements around we knew the same thing</p>
      <p begin="00:41:37.000" end="00:41:41.550">...of unity and that's what this guy's for overhear rather than a transform</p>
      <p begin="00:41:41.550" end="00:41:46.940">...to the...have a...to transform object and on a...transform this little drop down we</p>
      <p begin="00:41:46.940" end="00:41:50.640">get docking options that kind of remind me of what I would do with...inside</p>
      <p begin="00:41:50.640" end="00:41:52.230">...visual studio?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:52.230" end="00:41:56.010">So, I want to...to the top left this will move it to the top left and</p>
      <p begin="00:41:56.010" end="00:41:59.830">encrypt for me so I can...shift and alt.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:59.830" end="00:42:04.240">With the top left...can see that might anchor point is now up there.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:08.040">So, if I look at my game and...out.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:08.040" end="00:42:10.270">You can see that image stays the same size</p>
      <p begin="00:42:10.270" end="00:42:15.350">it's not getting smaller but it's also not getting pushed off the silo screen anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:15.350" end="00:42:20.590">So, easy way to handle at is I take my anger point which is actually for points they look</p>
      <p begin="00:42:20.590" end="00:42:29.770">bundle up there...a one and I can just bring them around the edge of my object like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:29.770" end="00:42:32.900">And, now I'm saying...anchoring these for corners.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:32.900" end="00:42:36.130">Essentially pinning it there and that's going to be relative to harm</p>
      <p begin="00:42:36.130" end="00:42:39.570">...screen...notice as I get smaller</p>
      <p begin="00:42:39.570" end="00:42:44.140">...scale smaller I can do the same thing with text boxes on there sometimes I</p>
      <p begin="00:42:44.140" end="00:42:48.980">want default anchoring positions so that top middle one that we did here.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:48.980" end="00:42:51.270">Let's take signal image here</p>
      <p begin="00:42:51.270" end="00:42:56.570">came object ui image and given that top middle.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:56.570" end="00:42:58.530">Set the aspect ratio</p>
      <p begin="00:42:58.530" end="00:43:04.460">...this to top middle well just so happens that because it's in the top middle there.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:04.460" end="00:43:11.580">And,...anchors right there...of like that works all right.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:11.580" end="00:43:13.640">Now of course it's not changing size so I'd</p>
      <p begin="00:43:13.640" end="00:43:17.090">probably one of bring this out here the edges.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:18.200" end="00:43:23.670">at the edge again you can do this will...you get the idea is just to elements here.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:23.670" end="00:43:29.570">Fully scales out so the easiest way to deal with multi device resolution...your objects test it</p>
      <p begin="00:43:29.570" end="00:43:34.420">...some helpers right here and, there's some pretty cool stuff available nearly access tours well</p>
      <p begin="00:43:34.420" end="00:43:38.820">...actually said a whole bunch of these for you take screen shots for you at all different</p>
      <p begin="00:43:38.820" end="00:43:44.620">...show you a gallery this is what it looks like across fifty devices you contestants...aspect ratio</p>
      <p begin="00:43:44.620" end="00:43:45.750">...I can see</p>
      <p begin="00:43:45.750" end="00:43:50.610">what it looks like on a sixteen by nine or for my three.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:50.610" end="00:43:54.700">And, you can add your on...you're working with particle device...want to add your own resolution on their</p>
      <p begin="00:43:54.700" end="00:44:07.500">...aspect ratio you can do as well very easy setup.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:07.500" end="00:44:10.270">Our next sharing code.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:10.270" end="00:44:15.030">When you have platform specific code that you want to run this way</p>
      <p begin="00:44:15.030" end="00:44:18.490">...one platform and this way...different platform you can use</p>
      <p begin="00:44:18.490" end="00:44:22.020">preset processor directives inside of...and there's a whole bunch of that are</p>
      <p begin="00:44:22.020" end="00:44:27.490">built in this one would say if I'm building for unity...here so</p>
      <p begin="00:44:27.490" end="00:44:32.140">...ap imagine for me days and w that uw p so for building currently for</p>
      <p begin="00:44:32.140" end="00:44:39.360">uw p and I'm not running...these editor then go ahead andcompiled a bit of</p>
      <p begin="00:44:39.360" end="00:44:43.110">We can take a step further you'll see that very common inside...projects</p>
      <p begin="00:44:43.110" end="00:44:48.290">...will target all different platforms I want you...that purchases on ios here using that I</p>
      <p begin="00:44:48.290" end="00:44:52.300">want to android over here...windows over here so this is very common</p>
      <p begin="00:44:52.300" end="00:44:58.370">...type of code inside immunity another thing you can do is you can write plugins you can do this before they change</p>
      <p begin="00:44:58.370" end="00:45:02.100">...plug-in model...five and I'll show you that in one second here</p>
      <p begin="00:45:02.100" end="00:45:06.700">but from a high-level standpoint here you have to libraries you have one that</p>
      <p begin="00:45:06.700" end="00:45:11.480">has your functionality built into it that has your api that's going to be used when unity</p>
      <p begin="00:45:11.480" end="00:45:17.620">bills your visual studio project...that guy and when you are running...unity is an</p>
      <p begin="00:45:17.620" end="00:45:21.740">environment a virtual environment that runs model mono not dot</p>
      <p begin="00:45:21.740" end="00:45:26.670">net for windows store different requirements different api so you need to say that</p>
      <p begin="00:45:26.670" end="00:45:31.650">hey we're compiling for...to store I want to use this library and when you running inside</p>
      <p begin="00:45:31.650" end="00:45:36.260">these editor you're going to use this stub library that has, you know, some fake function calls</p>
      <p begin="00:45:36.260" end="00:45:42.440">...or word our we want to act communities editor that's a second library...libraries?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:42.440" end="00:45:46.030">And, inside...itself you have settings and basically say hey we compile</p>
      <p begin="00:45:46.030" end="00:45:57.840">use this library and when you're running the editor use this one let's look at what that actually looks like here?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:57.840" end="00:45:59.830">This is a real basic example I</p>
      <p begin="00:45:59.830" end="00:46:06.350">have to products and generated one I did a file new</p>
      <p begin="00:46:06.350" end="00:46:10.750">projects and all-new project specified this was a windows universal</p>
      <p begin="00:46:10.750" end="00:46:16.800">classed library so it's going to understand that code and that name space.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:16.800" end="00:46:20.680">And, compile a particular way again that does not work</p>
      <p begin="00:46:20.680" end="00:46:23.130">...unique runs on a particular version model inside</p>
      <p begin="00:46:23.130" end="00:46:26.220">...a little virtual environment secondly I have a</p>
      <p begin="00:46:26.220" end="00:46:29.420">...library and this particular library here.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:29.420" end="00:46:31.390">If we look at this is</p>
      <p begin="00:46:31.390" end="00:46:36.260">a dot net framework three to five so that has the same api compatibility with what's running inside of</p>
      <p begin="00:46:36.260" end="00:46:42.320">...editor this is my stun library this is what I have my the code that's going to fix something out</p>
      <p begin="00:46:42.320" end="00:46:45.850">...do I think it out real easy way of doing this</p>
      <p begin="00:46:45.850" end="00:46:56.630">is you share your code between these projects if you've ever seen this if I say ad.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:56.630" end="00:46:59.380">And, I point-two a csharp file.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:59.380" end="00:47:03.620">If you're not familiar with this ad is link you add a source code project a file</p>
      <p begin="00:47:03.620" end="00:47:08.810">...project but it doesn't copy...your project just links to somewhere else there's any</p>
      <p begin="00:47:08.810" end="00:47:15.430">when the numbers and you'll see this extensively throughout the...source code...actually first-place...you add is a link</p>
      <p begin="00:47:15.430" end="00:47:22.390">and the cool thing that happens is when I compile here for my windows universal library?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:22.390" end="00:47:23.770">This is true.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:23.770" end="00:47:28.160">How do I know it's true what easy enough I just look at my properties?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:31.070">I can see our here's my conditional compilation</p>
      <p begin="00:47:31.070" end="00:47:33.240">...core...windows you ap.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:34.360" end="00:47:38.340">So, I know that's true so I compile this is going to work.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:38.340" end="00:47:42.880">And, I'm asking...new...particular contract present.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:42.880" end="00:47:44.930">Universal window apps operate on this</p>
      <p begin="00:47:44.930" end="00:47:49.890">idea of contracts hey is this contract present on the system and asking for that is a</p>
      <p begin="00:47:49.890" end="00:47:55.160">...you support this phone contract what this other stuff library running side of these</p>
      <p begin="00:47:55.160" end="00:47:59.420">...editor has no idea what that is so if I look at that code.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:59.420" end="00:48:03.690">...see the icons a little bit different here is the link csharp file.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:03.690" end="00:48:06.720">This is no longer true this project...know anything about it so</p>
      <p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:11.720">when I compile...that out so I take those two libraries and drag</p>
      <p begin="00:48:11.720" end="00:48:17.500">...over the unity and insider unity here I go to plugins.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:17.500" end="00:48:23.920">And, in the new system you can put a bunch of different locations I just like to have a...folder because I'm old-school.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:23.920" end="00:48:28.670">And, I highlight library does drag-and-drop and here platform tools...ll and I can specify</p>
      <p begin="00:48:28.670" end="00:48:30.790">hey this particular version is going to</p>
      <p begin="00:48:30.790" end="00:48:34.730">use only when you compile for windows store apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:34.730" end="00:48:38.480">Or...is the stub library and you're going to use this with somebody comes in the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:38.480" end="00:48:40.060">...click play.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:40.060" end="00:48:43.770">See specify which platform you want to be used for annually will smartly pull</p>
      <p begin="00:48:43.770" end="00:48:49.510">...in at the time when it needs any source code changes you make behind-the-scene usually</p>
      <p begin="00:48:49.510" end="00:48:53.330">will compile for-you automatically so when you click on play right here...is already</p>
      <p begin="00:48:53.330" end="00:48:58.430">...source code and compiled it's not a manual step it just happens automatically so the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:58.430" end="00:49:08.640">same principle happens here you check these often this just happens automatically.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:08.640" end="00:49:15.380">Our next a high-level...we go how</p>
      <p begin="00:49:16.530" end="00:49:20.470">The...you're seeing now is going to be targeted in unity five dot to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:20.470" end="00:49:26.510">...not out yet ...working hard making...available in the coming months.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:26.510" end="00:49:29.710">Remember that unity pro licenses so,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:29.710" end="00:49:33.670">free and pro from a software feature set are basically the same</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.670" end="00:49:38.770">levels each other usually pro you get these additional cloud services analytics...but you also get access</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38.770" end="00:49:46.450">to beta versions when they become availablethis was not available yet working hard to make is available the coming months?</p>
