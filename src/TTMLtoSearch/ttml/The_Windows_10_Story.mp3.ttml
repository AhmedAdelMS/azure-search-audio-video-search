      <p begin="00:00:01.660" end="00:00:02.450">Hello,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:02.450" end="00:00:07.330">everyone on channel nine it's really great to be here my name's mary jo</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.330" end="00:00:11.190">foley I do not work for microsoft I'm but I'm a microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.190" end="00:00:15.920">watcher email me all about microsoft-dot-com and I'm here interviewing</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.920" end="00:00:19.920">to of my favorite people from microsoft I've got</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.920" end="00:00:24.820">...guggenheim or the cheap of evangelist for microsoft and john</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.820" end="00:00:29.470">...who is the chiefly for microsoft.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.470" end="00:00:33.040">We're going to talk a little bit about the keynote you guys just came off the stage it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.040" end="00:00:36.200">was really exciting people in the audience,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.200" end="00:00:41.070">you know, there's questions that people want to see code I think we answer that today</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.070" end="00:00:44.400">...and, I want to hear from each of</p>
      <p begin="00:00:44.400" end="00:00:49.250">you kind of what your biggest take away it's like if people are here at builder watching</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.250" end="00:00:55.340">bill what do you really want them to take away the one big thing I'll start I think it, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.340" end="00:01:00.670">first offered cu closings today coming out kind of a pleasure to be interviewed by</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.110" end="00:01:08.950">I think there's, there's a couple things one is lots of times people to have this perception of all-or-nothing right</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.950" end="00:01:10.890">where it's either all microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.890" end="00:01:14.750">...somebody else...those days are gone it's not it's not a world</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.750" end="00:01:19.540">...all-or-nothing I think we try to show there's lots of different areas where we can add value and find</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.540" end="00:01:24.000">place to partner...spin-off might be windows it might be...might be the office graphic might be</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.000" end="00:01:28.350">...might be something but it's rare that we don't come across await...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:28.350" end="00:01:33.640">find things to do so the days of ogg...and then too...like I think back to the roots</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.640" end="00:01:40.410">would like work with developers...actually have fun with it pretty good at it so, we're here to do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.410" end="00:01:44.710">I think a couple other quick things clearly the company as I've</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.710" end="00:01:49.290">been there has really evolved its position on incorporating lots</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.290" end="00:01:52.520">of other technologies into solutions whether it's open-source third-party.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:53.580" end="00:01:58.240">Services so many applications are actually today stitching</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.240" end="00:02:03.690">together these different components to create a great solution so we're pretty excited to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.690" end="00:02:08.500">be able to show some of those examples and then show partners who are really using</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.500" end="00:02:09.800">our platform in that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.800" end="00:02:14.010">...to deliver on it and clearly the other big one just the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.010" end="00:02:20.120">ubiquity of data throughout the...I think just did a fantastic job kind-of highlighting the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.120" end="00:02:26.520">importance of data not just as a way to collect information but really understand it...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.520" end="00:02:31.280">I'm dying to ask you guys about what I think was one of the most interesting things</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.280" end="00:02:35.970">at the conference the announcement that microsoft's going out talking now to in</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.970" end="00:02:40.290">very developers and ios developers and trying to bring them into the windows tenfold</p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.610" end="00:02:45.230">I'm curious like what do you...go...developers so we have been, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:45.230" end="00:02:49.080">I mean...so what's the elevator pitch what do you go and say to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:49.080" end="00:02:53.940">...android developer why they should come to the windows...I don't usually think of developers</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.940" end="00:02:57.140">is sort of an android developer...mobile developers of time</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.140" end="00:03:01.110">build apps for devices or their building apps for something specific</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.110" end="00:03:06.030">...the conversation comes down to a we have a great platform allows you to do some unique</p>
      <p begin="00:03:06.030" end="00:03:10.380">...we actually have a volume and scale especially anything about windows ten</p>
      <p begin="00:03:10.380" end="00:03:15.140">aggregating all devices together the...is how do we make it as easy as possible for-you to move</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.140" end="00:03:20.270">on to the platform and take advantage of it so if they've written coded and where they have...mobile app</p>
      <p begin="00:03:20.270" end="00:03:25.410">where they've...iowa's app that's a potential bridge into the platform so usually the conversation</p>
      <p begin="00:03:25.410" end="00:03:29.880">...a balance between let's talk about the scale the platform was talk about some of</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29.880" end="00:03:33.570">...unique things we offer another...out the easiest way for you to get</p>
      <p begin="00:03:33.570" end="00:03:37.300">onto the platform and then over time we talk about...you can do,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:37.300" end="00:03:39.850">yeah, I mean often when we sat down with...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.850" end="00:03:45.620">and ios developer and we've had the conversation that...just described there's often a little bit</p>
      <p begin="00:03:45.620" end="00:03:51.260">of skepticism about old could we really do this so we've sat down with a number of folks</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.260" end="00:03:55.650">taking their code run it through the compiler generated that windows application and I think</p>
      <p begin="00:03:55.650" end="00:04:01.200">for some people it's almost like a magic trick they're like no way I can't believe that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:06.140">it's actually working...unimportant thing happens which is the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.140" end="00:04:10.960">see the app now running on windows they see the potential they understand</p>
      <p begin="00:04:10.960" end="00:04:15.660">all maybe this wouldn't maybe we could reduce my costa develop...so</p>
      <p begin="00:04:15.660" end="00:04:19.300">...a lot of ways I think these bridges are the door openers</p>
      <p begin="00:04:19.300" end="00:04:22.930">that enabled the conversation about what we could do with</p>
      <p begin="00:04:22.930" end="00:04:27.760">that billion customers what we could do with the value-added features?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.760" end="00:04:31.950">The question is this is something I'm hearing a lot from the existing microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:04:31.950" end="00:04:37.710">developers existing windows development community what.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.710" end="00:04:42.680">I guess the question is why shouldn't they be afraid of you guys doing this so suddenly here come</p>
      <p begin="00:04:42.680" end="00:04:47.010">all these android developers your come all these ios developers and now they're competing with these</p>
      <p begin="00:04:47.010" end="00:04:50.240">people have been loyal to the platform and have been developed developing</p>
      <p begin="00:04:50.240" end="00:04:55.230">for windows for years like what is their advantage...as a windows</p>
      <p begin="00:04:55.230" end="00:04:59.770">will look at the end of the process we're really looking for great</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.770" end="00:05:04.850">windows applicationsuniversal windows platform gives you this</p>
      <p begin="00:05:04.850" end="00:05:09.690">ability to create these apps that spans all of these different vices and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:09.690" end="00:05:13.910">at the tool set that people have developed whether it be and dot net or</p>
      <p begin="00:05:13.910" end="00:05:18.330">...all those are things that kind of show through now interestingly</p>
      <p begin="00:05:18.330" end="00:05:23.400">...sat down with some of these folks...move some say entry code over some ios code</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23.400" end="00:05:28.420">in many cases people look at this and I think, you know, I might want to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:28.420" end="00:05:32.560">...user interface more natively to be able to take advantage of some of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:32.560" end="00:05:37.230">that scaling capability because you guys are providing some incredible things</p>
      <p begin="00:05:37.230" end="00:05:39.400">about, for example, different</p>
      <p begin="00:05:39.400" end="00:05:44.200">input mods across these devices think about how tricky it is to build</p>
      <p begin="00:05:44.200" end="00:05:49.450">and app that can run on the phone and on and xbox and be able to do that so they want</p>
      <p begin="00:05:49.450" end="00:05:53.010">to take advantage of that toolkit I think the other...the other side of the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.010" end="00:05:58.310">conversation is the things that people find the most interesting exciting like look at the conference follow</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58.310" end="00:06:03.090">...incredible reception that requires universal windows apple ultimately so</p>
      <p begin="00:06:03.090" end="00:06:07.030">the developers that are already there great dana headstart on moving on to</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.030" end="00:06:12.300">or across the various devices and...developers looked the more apps on the platform</p>
      <p begin="00:06:12.300" end="00:06:16.320">better off the platform is the better it is the ecosystem rising tide raises all boats so I think</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.320" end="00:06:21.120">in our case is how do we get as many experiences that are users one on...platform and for requires</p>
      <p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:26.310">abridge to help people get their we feel pretty good that once they start there's other things are going to want to which</p>
      <p begin="00:06:26.310" end="00:06:32.940">you know, sort of all say bring them further into the windows conversation are into that broader community I mean really</p>
      <p begin="00:06:32.940" end="00:06:37.600">does have that the fundamental shift that's going on here is we're just trying to reach out to everybody</p>
      <p begin="00:06:37.600" end="00:06:42.010">on every platform and make it easier we want them to be able to bring their code and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:42.010" end="00:06:45.510">we're trying to get out of the mode that I think the industry</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.510" end="00:06:50.660">within for a while saying hey you must do things this way?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.660" end="00:06:55.490">We've had this conversation privately before but...I'd love to hear you explain</p>
      <p begin="00:06:55.490" end="00:07:00.100">more about what with windows ten...going to be more interesting to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:00.100" end="00:07:05.040">developers all up what and it kinda comes down to money right like what do you</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.040" end="00:07:10.000">guys going to do with windows ten that you didn't do was seven and eight to help developers make</p>
      <p begin="00:07:11.180" end="00:07:16.320">...first of all say it's important to say we want to help developers do what they care about for</p>
      <p begin="00:07:16.320" end="00:07:20.630">their in some cases that's modernization has lots of bc access do other things so I think</p>
      <p begin="00:07:20.630" end="00:07:25.180">the and people measure device let's take the money one first off you</p>
      <p begin="00:07:25.180" end="00:07:28.920">want aggregated many users as possible so the ability to take the windows</p>
      <p begin="00:07:28.920" end="00:07:33.560">ten for us the pc base which is our largest plus...plus xbox and be able to create</p>
      <p begin="00:07:33.560" end="00:07:39.340">experience...step one is volume the second thing is actually getting them into the app... the interesting part</p>
      <p begin="00:07:39.340" end="00:07:44.010">there's if you look at the phone people are used to going to a store on the phone and on xbox</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44.010" end="00:07:49.190">to use the dashboard the trick now is with windows...on the desktop...the pc is how we get people</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.190" end="00:07:54.170">into the store there so that's what...showing off yesterday that ability to use the start...the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.170" end="00:07:57.540">...there that help people find applications the ability to use</p>
      <p begin="00:07:57.540" end="00:08:02.470">core tonic the ability to have a rotating tile for the store so I think we're working on doing over</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02.470" end="00:08:07.780">time is making that the desktop or the pc as interesting in terms of going...the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:07.780" end="00:08:12.540">finding apps as all the other devices so now you have an aggregation volume you have a</p>
      <p begin="00:08:13.780" end="00:08:19.080">...or a...to try and get people into the app and then it's all about haven instruments</p>
      <p begin="00:08:19.080" end="00:08:22.650">...we talked about the ability to do credit card building across the pc across all</p>
      <p begin="00:08:22.650" end="00:08:27.920">devices you look at other payment instruments you look at different types of payment models I talked a little</p>
      <p begin="00:08:27.920" end="00:08:32.610">bit wishes and today about the ability only for web experience based app in the store referral</p>
      <p begin="00:08:32.610" end="00:08:37.940">programs so I think we're going to run the gamut from scale first getting into the app seconds</p>
      <p begin="00:08:37.940" end="00:08:40.419">...modernization there.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:40.419" end="00:08:43.699">...on that totally agree those are all the things that</p>
      <p begin="00:08:43.699" end="00:08:48.589">developers look at were talking about money on the other side of the house there's a bunch of</p>
      <p begin="00:08:48.589" end="00:08:53.419">technical capabilities that I think are increasingly exciting to people, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:53.419" end="00:08:56.399">the deep linking...showed from core</p>
      <p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:09:00.209">...a directly down into the app or that david</p>
      <p begin="00:09:00.209" end="00:09:05.399">kevin showed right into the middle of the game having intelligence in the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:05.399" end="00:09:09.869">system to be able to help you find gaps to be able to help you get your</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.869" end="00:09:11.889">day-to-day jobs done I think it's</p>
      <p begin="00:09:11.889" end="00:09:18.660">...be an increasingly important part of a way people interact with our computers.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:18.660" end="00:09:20.470">Kentucky to a few developers who</p>
      <p begin="00:09:20.470" end="00:09:25.310">are a little bit skeptical about the universal platform...and here's what they</p>
      <p begin="00:09:25.310" end="00:09:29.840">skeptic skeptical about they believe that you could do the one code once store</p>
      <p begin="00:09:31.110" end="00:09:35.950">...believe all that but...skepticism is more about why what I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:09:35.950" end="00:09:41.150">...and the example is, you know, someone who develops and app expressly</p>
      <p begin="00:09:41.150" end="00:09:45.880">for windows phone or phones and they don't really see a case for putting it on xbox</p>
      <p begin="00:09:45.880" end="00:09:49.610">are follow...or surface hub...so what do you</p>
      <p begin="00:09:49.610" end="00:09:54.700">say that I mean what is it is that kind of well you don't have to...don't want</p>
      <p begin="00:09:54.700" end="00:09:58.540">to or...at a case where you could kind of explain to them white</p>
      <p begin="00:09:58.540" end="00:10:03.590">...like that it's a little bit above and I mean that we end up talking a lot of those</p>
      <p begin="00:10:03.590" end="00:10:06.910">...you know, it's mobile volume first great let's have</p>

      <p begin="00:11:06.580" end="00:11:10.960">...not only that one of those things developers of...this is very important</p>
      <p begin="00:11:10.960" end="00:11:15.600">is the ability to independently...those different platforms so,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:18.580">for example, maybe they've advanced along way</p>
      <p begin="00:11:18.580" end="00:11:23.360">...the phone but that same map might be really great for</p>
      <p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:27.260">say showing photo albums or other kinds of things on xbox.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:27.260" end="00:11:29.750">But, you don't want to have to do all the testing and that kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:11:29.750" end="00:11:33.660">stuff in and some of the other platforms you kinda get stuck doing</p>
      <p begin="00:11:33.660" end="00:11:38.160">and all-or-nothing here we can manage that stuff independently I met I met with...developer</p>

      <p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:50.910">...I can do those others but it's not necessarily what I want to do</p>
      <p begin="00:11:50.910" end="00:11:56.470">...like right that's...conversations to a great job your first if we can figure out.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:56.470" end="00:11:58.610">As an example where this occurs all-time</p>
      <p begin="00:11:58.610" end="00:12:02.200">is particularly around creative or editing</p>
      <p begin="00:12:02.200" end="00:12:07.920">kind those tend to be on the pc and then often what ends up happening is that</p>
      <p begin="00:12:07.920" end="00:12:10.880">...the versions on other platform</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:17.610">on xbox or on the phone to be more about the browsing experience of that.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:17.610" end="00:12:22.600">Another thing I talked to a few people hear about that they were really excited about was bringing</p>

      <p begin="00:12:28.740" end="00:12:32.760">...you...the numbers from...iterate...huge but,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:32.760" end="00:12:36.720">the question of getting a lot is how does that actually happened because I've heard some people say</p>
      <p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:40.820">sand boxing something aptly...he met we mentioned...the in the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:40.820" end="00:12:47.640">...great but, what do you have to exchange as a developer...bringing?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:47.640" end="00:12:51.910">...start what again at the primary thing that apathy is doing is</p>
      <p begin="00:12:51.910" end="00:12:55.820">...providing a level of indirection into many of the system calls that</p>
      <p begin="00:12:55.820" end="00:13:01.220">historically have wired app in deeply to the operating system and</p>
      <p begin="00:13:01.220" end="00:13:05.990">that deep wiring can sometimes cause the system to become increasingly unstable</p>
      <p begin="00:13:05.990" end="00:13:11.060">overtime so really this that what the...the container is giving you is that</p>
      <p begin="00:13:11.060" end="00:13:15.550">...degree of isolation so that from a...I can...on install I</p>
      <p begin="00:13:15.550" end="00:13:21.770">feel-good about the experience we're also doing a bunch of work to ensure that</p>
      <p begin="00:13:21.770" end="00:13:25.180">when thirty-two code can then take advantage of the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:25.180" end="00:13:29.020">new modern capabilities and that has</p>
      <p begin="00:13:29.020" end="00:13:33.520">...that's been difficult before and one of the key is to that is actually to have a story</p>
      <p begin="00:13:33.520" end="00:13:36.630">...so that all of those system api</p>
      <p begin="00:13:36.630" end="00:13:41.590">which required to know what app is being used now those apps have a</p>
      <p begin="00:13:41.590" end="00:13:46.280">...entity and they can make that the...culture the other piece that goes with</p>
      <p begin="00:13:46.280" end="00:13:51.410">that is creating a store app so creating a manifest allowing</p>
      <p begin="00:13:51.410" end="00:13:55.800">...doesn't have an appropriate content dinner things if you want so there's the technical side of</p>
      <p begin="00:13:55.800" end="00:14:00.510">...enabling use of the new api...protecting system for not running well and</p>
      <p begin="00:14:00.510" end="00:14:06.770">...protecting the end-user from inappropriate content and that sort of what the...brought...the...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:06.770" end="00:14:10.720">Another question on the store up that is both</p>
      <p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:14.060">...question hra about things as they stand now and things with</p>
      <p begin="00:14:14.060" end="00:14:15.970">...sent out so especially</p>
      <p begin="00:14:15.970" end="00:14:21.660">...windows phone and I'm a windows phone user I'm going to the three-person.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:21.660" end="00:14:26.660">I I'm worried because I'm seeing some apps disappear from the store things like chase and</p>
      <p begin="00:14:26.660" end="00:14:31.530">bank of america like very key apps and I am wondering what you guys think you</p>
      <p begin="00:14:31.530" end="00:14:33.680">can do that pringles apps...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:35.350" end="00:14:39.220">Let's say goes...we talked about we talked pretty regularly it's a good conversation banks</p>
      <p begin="00:14:39.220" end="00:14:43.250">are interesting category where they have a lot of regulatory compliance</p>
      <p begin="00:14:43.250" end="00:14:48.800">so the notion of keeping an app where a is not have...high-volume as others and</p>
      <p begin="00:14:48.800" end="00:14:53.170">...they know we're going to windows can and...other options that's sort of the role</p>
      <p begin="00:14:53.170" end="00:14:58.290">conversation there so the conversations we have it's we we're not happy with loosing from</p>
      <p begin="00:14:58.290" end="00:15:02.770">...I wrote user both of their from the...by the same time the conversation we</p>
      <p begin="00:15:02.770" end="00:15:08.050">move to is what's the right model for the go forward so our energy right now with all</p>
      <p begin="00:15:08.050" end="00:15:12.800">developers what's...go forward we talked bankamerica chase pretty regularly so,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:12.800" end="00:15:16.770">that's the dialogue which is I think they see the value in particular around the website if you look at</p>
      <p begin="00:15:16.770" end="00:15:21.910">banks they do it but they have these great web experiences the notion of responsive design</p>
      <p begin="00:15:21.910" end="00:15:25.340">web-based it just makes sense for them so the question is how</p>
      <p begin="00:15:25.340" end="00:15:29.390">we go forward and we bridge between now and then sometimes we lose a few but the goal now</p>
      <p begin="00:15:29.390" end="00:15:33.790">some of them forward and get to windows...and use things they would actually do anyway because</p>
      <p begin="00:15:33.790" end="00:15:37.520">some people ask me about it they always say why does...microsoft just</p>
      <p begin="00:15:37.520" end="00:15:43.270">...them or if they can give them developers to do the apps for the but certainly the case</p>

      <p begin="00:15:46.990" end="00:15:51.620">...regulate the notion of keeping...app going...putting investment against when,</p>

      <p begin="00:16:58.720" end="00:17:02.700">lot today was that ability to take web content.</p>

      <p begin="00:17:44.660" end="00:17:49.850">sort-of or many the...a great example in the bank conversation is</p>
      <p begin="00:17:49.850" end="00:17:53.600">...web apps can be used for a lot of that but guess what when you</p>

      <p begin="00:18:34.090" end="00:18:38.950">we're now I just want to put a copy on just that everybody understands in order to</p>
      <p begin="00:18:38.950" end="00:18:44.690">run that when thirty-two code it requires some of the desktop subsystems so you</p>
      <p begin="00:18:44.690" end="00:18:49.420">should expect, for example, that when forms app is going to run, for example, on a raspberry</p>
      <p begin="00:18:49.420" end="00:18:53.800">pie it does it does separate the apps that we can bring on</p>
      <p begin="00:18:53.800" end="00:18:57.520">...platforms from ones...think about as a universal windows platform</p>
      <p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:00.880">...because if I go to the following which runs a different processor</p>
      <p begin="00:19:00.880" end="00:19:04.910">around the subsystems not necessarily going to work there so that's I think</p>
      <p begin="00:19:04.910" end="00:19:11.480">...john's point you can get it was...over...you may not be across...and that said</p>

      <p begin="00:19:20.810" end="00:19:25.710">A related question for me is you guys talk so much these days now about</p>
      <p begin="00:19:25.710" end="00:19:30.650">opensource and even make it part of your key notes and...integrating</p>
      <p begin="00:19:30.650" end="00:19:35.950">and various places and tolls you're working with that community and I'm kinda curious</p>
      <p begin="00:19:35.950" end="00:19:41.180">what do you get out of that like I understand in some ways</p>
      <p begin="00:19:41.180" end="00:19:44.000">wide microsoft is doing this but.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:48.300">That's kind of the motivation for you guys getting involved here you are you hoping</p>
      <p begin="00:19:48.300" end="00:19:52.510">to get people who have kind of ignore the microsoft platform because you aren't</p>
      <p begin="00:19:52.510" end="00:19:54.810">...it...to the platform versus something</p>
      <p begin="00:19:54.810" end="00:19:59.670">different I don't think there's anything other than the most basic.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:59.670" end="00:20:04.320">Fact that a lot of people leverage open-source can technologies to go build their</p>
      <p begin="00:20:04.320" end="00:20:09.170">application right so if we for some reason had this view no,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:09.170" end="00:20:13.930">we don't want open-source technologies on a platform I think...making it very hard for</p>
      <p begin="00:20:13.930" end="00:20:20.010">people to advance the other thing that we're seeing is just a mass amount of innovation in the</p>

      <p begin="00:20:37.440" end="00:20:42.380">open-source projects we love being part of that you guys just have this great conversation with</p>
      <p begin="00:20:42.380" end="00:20:47.210">chris from get have about how are you from his perspective it's just been</p>
