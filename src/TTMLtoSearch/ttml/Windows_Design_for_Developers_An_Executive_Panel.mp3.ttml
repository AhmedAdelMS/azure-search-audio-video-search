      <p begin="00:00:04.080" end="00:00:07.510">Welcome.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.350" end="00:00:16.010">And, welcome toour session getting bounce right it's my name's albert...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.010" end="00:00:21.130">I lead the oversee design team and the honor it's to be part of</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.130" end="00:00:24.920">this experience that build to share some of our work but,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.920" end="00:00:27.820">more importantly it's also for me and the team to learn more about</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.820" end="00:00:48.700">what you working on so now let's just started and ...of talk more about design so.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.700" end="00:00:50.100">And, we from.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:54.000">Bill and windows ten an obvious...little clip</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.000" end="00:00:59.220">here we've actually done a lot of design work over the years I think windows again,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.220" end="00:01:04.030">I said...an experience that's been evolving for over thirty years...part that journeys</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.030" end="00:01:09.110">be prior experience it's really exciting but it's also it's for me it's...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:09.110" end="00:01:13.860">and a team there's been a lot of our learning and I want to share some of that today so</p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.860" end="00:01:17.460">rt what's interesting about it it's not just</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.460" end="00:01:22.260">...a team of designers we have design developers you have design camera</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.260" end="00:01:23.340">fun encoders</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.340" end="00:01:27.710">have researchers all and we're all working together to create windows the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.710" end="00:01:32.100">product but also we brought in xbox we...services we</p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.100" end="00:01:38.120">...in teams working on these like I'll...and...we had a team that was you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.120" end="00:01:41.100">the sm buildingaway from...a good work on</p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:44.190">...for last couple years and be able...all</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.190" end="00:01:50.360">...together in an environment about sharing and learning to make windows great</p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.360" end="00:01:54.520">... that's what's so exciting and we...like I said in open environment</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.520" end="00:02:00.880">were one it's about sharing learning like I said but also I think this is important</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.880" end="00:02:05.070">...about how we building windows being the openness be able to take</p>
      <p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:09.300">a new ideas I think that's another key part of windows that I've really</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.300" end="00:02:13.310">enjoy being part of for last year and we work with</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.310" end="00:02:17.620">teams across microsoft in office in</p>
      <p begin="00:02:17.620" end="00:02:22.380">bing in sky-high outlook one drive one</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.380" end="00:02:27.390">node all working together debate bring that work into a cohesive and,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.390" end="00:02:33.010">I would say hopefully a refreshing and new experience to-you but,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:33.010" end="00:02:40.060">also to allow you to bil on top of that so that's important part.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:40.060" end="00:02:44.050">And, then the other part I want to talk more by I think is really the themes about getting the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.050" end="00:02:48.900">bounds fright it's ...in san cisco a beautiful city and,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.900" end="00:02:52.600">you saw this morning's talk by such a...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.600" end="00:02:57.690">Scott joel alex it's...to me as a designer</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.690" end="00:03:03.120">...see this theme that's kind of a carrying with all the work redoing in terms of windows</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.120" end="00:03:06.570">...building bridges how do you connect all these</p>
      <p begin="00:03:06.570" end="00:03:11.060">...that we've been working on the experiences between a pc</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.060" end="00:03:15.750">...a phones create continuum that spans your experiences</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.750" end="00:03:20.340">making sure that the things that we create that we design a allows you to be</p>
      <p begin="00:03:20.340" end="00:03:25.150">mobile and not about the device and I think that's what's so exciting the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:25.150" end="00:03:31.110">same time if you about building bridges...hard they take a lot of work and,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:31.110" end="00:03:36.180">to get across the big ocean to get across that turbulent waters someone's</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.180" end="00:03:40.680">...go forward and go across...and sometimes I feel like that's our team</p>
      <p begin="00:03:40.680" end="00:03:44.730">...designing apps we're trying new things sometimes it gets</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.730" end="00:03:50.450">across the stream sometimes it doesn't but what make sure is we're constantly trying to build</p>
      <p begin="00:03:50.450" end="00:03:56.240">that bridge to connect at all and that's more important and,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.240" end="00:04:00.210">hopefully today I'll share more about some of those things</p>
      <p begin="00:04:00.210" end="00:04:06.610">...create that bridge to the other part of...hash...the golden gate bridge itself</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.610" end="00:04:10.630">...you familiar of going a bridge...bridge...a bridges</p>
      <p begin="00:04:10.630" end="00:04:15.370">...on tension it's really these cables a hanging out together and there's</p>
      <p begin="00:04:15.370" end="00:04:20.230">this tension in the system and we're going to talk more supports my attention that we</p>
      <p begin="00:04:20.230" end="00:04:25.050">tried create something that spans all these products how do you create</p>
      <p begin="00:04:25.050" end="00:04:29.190">...attention between what's right on a pc what's right on the phone</p>
      <p begin="00:04:29.190" end="00:04:33.770">and bridge that and it's a delicate balance and some things were</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33.770" end="00:04:39.020">so innovating on but I want to rest assured that...do together and we're...take that learning</p>
      <p begin="00:04:39.020" end="00:04:42.670">...also apply to your apps the things that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:42.670" end="00:04:49.400">you're creating so that's really important kind-of theme to take took note of.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.400" end="00:04:53.910">And, in terms of their journey that we've been on it is something that I think especially if you're familiar</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53.910" end="00:04:57.500">and this is a design session five years ago when we started the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:57.500" end="00:05:00.800">...we envision what mobile could be were really</p>
      <p begin="00:05:00.800" end="00:05:06.050">inspire by the idea of transportation graphics not just in terms of the visual</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.050" end="00:05:07.320">...bonus but,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:07.320" end="00:05:14.050">also this clean I would say bowl information design that really helps</p>
      <p begin="00:05:14.050" end="00:05:17.900">you navigate and finer things you want to do and, we were inspired</p>
      <p begin="00:05:17.900" end="00:05:22.850">by great natural systems like london underground the tokyo</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23.980" end="00:05:30.690">...system and of course the work in new york city...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:30.690" end="00:05:34.970">...really took identity and information graphics and...together into</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.970" end="00:05:40.070">it rich coherent information design... those are things...still true I think</p>
      <p begin="00:05:40.070" end="00:05:45.440">that's still part of...design...it's...still part of our design language and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.440" end="00:05:49.970">...make sure that is where we came from and that's who...are still today the other</p>
      <p begin="00:05:49.970" end="00:05:55.040">inspiration in terms are journey was this idea of using graphics system</p>
      <p begin="00:05:55.040" end="00:05:59.720">that really celebrate typography and some people call this the international type of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:59.720" end="00:06:04.620">graphic style or swiss design euler block within the clean.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.620" end="00:06:08.180">Use of grid system to allow you create that</p>
      <p begin="00:06:08.180" end="00:06:10.740">...strong hierarchy for information and having</p>
      <p begin="00:06:10.740" end="00:06:15.460">...to stick with it I think that's the part that we really adopted into in terms of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.460" end="00:06:20.060">...design system and that's still here today so,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:20.060" end="00:06:24.130">that's the foundation of...five years ago seems like a long-time</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24.130" end="00:06:29.290">and without foundation we worked on we envision phone we took we had back then</p>
      <p begin="00:06:29.290" end="00:06:33.430">which is windows mobile and able to we envision like I said but also I think</p>
      <p begin="00:06:33.430" end="00:06:36.790">bring it forward...in a sense of having...clarity having</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.790" end="00:06:42.080">...purpose and we did it with some very clear principles which we still</p>
      <p begin="00:06:42.080" end="00:06:46.590">use today this idea that content should be the thing that you care about not</p>
      <p begin="00:06:46.590" end="00:06:52.300">the chrome or not the thing that's helps you just navigate it's really the about the content and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:52.300" end="00:06:54.800">...ensure its clean and open</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.800" end="00:06:59.460">...the content grieve having space for that and,...then</p>
      <p begin="00:06:59.460" end="00:07:02.700">...typography using typing rich way ...</p>
      <p begin="00:07:02.700" end="00:07:08.000">identified also be navigate and then I think the part that sometimes gets that's well,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:13.340">it's a good conversation highly things digital that's an especially things like</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.340" end="00:07:16.930">...a lot of overly use of kind of analogue</p>
      <p begin="00:07:16.930" end="00:07:21.760">icons and things like that what does it mean in a digital world when the icon itself has no</p>
      <p begin="00:07:21.760" end="00:07:25.890">...or needs a new...meaning how do you how to create those</p>
      <p begin="00:07:27.090" end="00:07:30.590">designs so the principles are still with us</p>
      <p begin="00:07:30.590" end="00:07:34.200">...so user todaywith the team but, I would say</p>
      <p begin="00:07:34.200" end="00:07:39.430">we're we've also be evolving and you look at where we came from five years ago to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:39.430" end="00:07:44.430">where we are today hopefully you see that it's a natural evolution and,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44.430" end="00:07:48.250">it's part of our dna and we're going to keep</p>
      <p begin="00:07:48.250" end="00:07:52.320">within we gotta keep on growing it and evolve it and,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:52.320" end="00:07:57.680">the part I was exciting for myself and a team last year last couple years was we didn't just stop</p>
      <p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:02.600">of the full we had the opportunity to rethink or...vision where the desktop</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02.600" end="00:08:07.210">could go and the work that we did to take the desktop forward I think we</p>
      <p begin="00:08:07.210" end="00:08:12.230">...hot we fundamentally saw that there's an opportunity to bring</p>
      <p begin="00:08:12.230" end="00:08:16.760">the two together and with their work that we shown today with continuum</p>
      <p begin="00:08:16.760" end="00:08:21.560">that's really the vision of how we're going to bring a designs together it's pretty exciting world but,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:21.560" end="00:08:25.710">we didn't stop there this evolution of our design it's really like I said</p>
      <p begin="00:08:25.710" end="00:08:31.570">...journey what we did in threshold was...I would say pretty</p>
      <p begin="00:08:31.570" end="00:08:35.830">auditions and, that's why it's hundley we took our design</p>
      <p begin="00:08:35.830" end="00:08:40.210">system say hey let's stop there how do we continue revolving really think about windows</p>
      <p begin="00:08:40.210" end="00:08:44.280">...the universal platform having a universal design</p>
      <p begin="00:08:44.280" end="00:08:49.040">system that spans across devices like phone and pc but</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.040" end="00:08:54.180">even more even tv experiences or ten foot experiences or even</p>
      <p begin="00:08:54.180" end="00:08:57.380">...experiences...about that we didn't just say hey</p>
      <p begin="00:08:57.380" end="00:09:00.970">...let's do updated design for the phone we-re?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:00.970" end="00:09:04.790">We fundamentally...think about how do we design whole system for</p>
      <p begin="00:09:04.790" end="00:09:09.830">universal windows ecosystem so that was something that we're working on was still working</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.830" end="00:09:14.420">on and we have so much share but today I'm just going to give you a glimpse of that and hopefully</p>
      <p begin="00:09:14.420" end="00:09:19.790">what will share more and more on how we approaching the universal windows design and,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:19.790" end="00:09:24.860">they'll be lot more content and tools for you to think about how to create your universal windows platform</p>
      <p begin="00:09:24.860" end="00:09:29.690">app without said the other part was I think this is the...part we</p>
      <p begin="00:09:29.690" end="00:09:33.930">tagged looking at designing a system how do you move forward but</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.930" end="00:09:38.430">was still be based on a strong foundation and we can use</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.430" end="00:09:42.830">...analogy...foundation for the city that you do one different neighborhoods</p>
      <p begin="00:09:42.830" end="00:09:46.130">...city be vibrant but it's got all work together those bridges</p>
      <p begin="00:09:46.130" end="00:09:50.300">the to connect those train tracks these to work with each other you want to be able to drive from one</p>
      <p begin="00:09:50.300" end="00:09:55.260">able to another so the foundation for the city needs to be very strong so we did more work on that</p>
      <p begin="00:09:55.260" end="00:09:57.190">and then having comic controls</p>
      <p begin="00:09:57.190" end="00:10:01.940">the just works that makes it easy to develop a thing I think I was a lot of feedback from</p>
      <p begin="00:10:01.940" end="00:10:07.070">folks who were with us for the early phone experiences and windows experiences</p>
      <p begin="00:10:07.070" end="00:10:12.050">how do we create similar apps or similar designs that we were creating and I think</p>
      <p begin="00:10:12.050" end="00:10:19.060">that some of the more things we sharing and then the new thing I think this is the area that we're still</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.060" end="00:10:22.050">...is cranial adaptive ux that works across</p>
      <p begin="00:10:22.050" end="00:10:27.810">...and it's something that if you're familiar responsive design it's something</p>
      <p begin="00:10:27.810" end="00:10:31.740">that it takes a lot of worked to put theory into practice and</p>
      <p begin="00:10:31.740" end="00:10:36.520">we'll share some of that work in a sessions and the next couple days but this idea of adapting ux and</p>
      <p begin="00:10:36.520" end="00:10:40.000">...reddit...different devices a different context I think that's a</p>
      <p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:46.240">really exciting area for us to grow and then lastly I think this idea of sliding I'm going to share more about</p>
      <p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:53.850">wow how we flighty what are we doing why...and how...how you could be part of that?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:53.850" end="00:10:56.990">So, this universal windows.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:56.990" end="00:10:59.000">A year-ago I think kevin and team</p>
      <p begin="00:10:59.000" end="00:11:03.750">and dave share this idea of universal apps and...easily</p>
      <p begin="00:11:03.750" end="00:11:10.110">evolve into a larger opportunity where it's not just...apps themselves but</p>
      <p begin="00:11:10.110" end="00:11:14.430">the whole ecosystem so that we're going to have one store where all these apps</p>
      <p begin="00:11:14.430" end="00:11:19.580">...to have one sdk having one set of tools having one place where you</p>
      <p begin="00:11:19.580" end="00:11:23.240">can create experiences that works on all these devices that</p>
      <p begin="00:11:23.240" end="00:11:28.130">is an exciting opportunity and for us we really have to be think about how we design we</p>
      <p begin="00:11:28.130" end="00:11:32.280">that we can just design we're just going to make a great phone experience like I said</p>
      <p begin="00:11:32.280" end="00:11:37.070">but really think about how does that experience flex and you hear me he's not</p>
      <p begin="00:11:37.070" end="00:11:41.200">rely words like flex adapt but it is above flexing our systems</p>
      <p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:46.300">that your apps can work that are app can work in all these different devices</p>
      <p begin="00:11:46.300" end="00:11:51.300">so, there's a lot to learn and we're still learning but this is what we the problem</p>
      <p begin="00:11:51.300" end="00:11:55.490">or the opportunity we saw from our design system and,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:55.490" end="00:12:00.980">we definite lots of share and today I think the teams get just announce we'll have a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:12:00.980" end="00:12:06.550">these learning's on our...center that we just launch so go check that out so how to create</p>
      <p begin="00:12:06.550" end="00:12:11.100">universal windows platform apps go check odessa and there's a lot of get content</p>
      <p begin="00:12:11.100" end="00:12:16.720">their to think about how you could use our system and some are learnings.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:19.570">And, then the other part.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:19.570" end="00:12:23.200">Especially on insider team sometimes...share a lot and,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:23.200" end="00:12:28.720">maybe that's why so small...these are the concepts that we...a small sample</p>
      <p begin="00:12:28.720" end="00:12:32.370">...hundreds and we design like I say we didn't just look at the phone...look the pc</p>
      <p begin="00:12:32.370" end="00:12:37.800">look ten foot look at even different device form factor that didn't exist and read a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:12:37.800" end="00:12:41.270">of innovations went from mild to while the things</p>
      <p begin="00:12:41.270" end="00:12:46.210">that you would say like wow that's will never work to how do we again...content</p>
      <p begin="00:12:46.210" end="00:12:50.610">be more expressive more personal richer the use of color</p>
      <p begin="00:12:50.610" end="00:12:55.600">strong typography those principles I mention that we've had for last five years how</p>
      <p begin="00:12:55.600" end="00:13:01.090">to apply them even and push...system ...the edge ahead and,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:01.090" end="00:13:06.070">get a sense of how our design can move forward that's the work we did to help kind of build</p>
      <p begin="00:13:06.070" end="00:13:11.070">a platform out and, some of it is making a product some of it will make...the product a</p>
      <p begin="00:13:11.070" end="00:13:15.430">bit later but understand this work constantly pushing the edge of</p>
      <p begin="00:13:15.430" end="00:13:17.660">where I design since we can go and we want you do that</p>
      <p begin="00:13:17.660" end="00:13:23.960">two of us to tell us where we can take the design system.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:23.960" end="00:13:28.330">And, then once we...does the part around common controls having</p>
      <p begin="00:13:28.330" end="00:13:33.100">a consistent set of controls that you can use I think this is an investment that</p>
      <p begin="00:13:33.100" end="00:13:37.910">we fundamental had made in windows ten that we were going to use the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:37.910" end="00:13:41.290">exact same tool we using example for our design uses</p>
      <p begin="00:13:41.290" end="00:13:45.000">exactly tools that you're using to design our applications</p>
      <p begin="00:13:45.000" end="00:13:51.320">design even our system so that's big investment for us and,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:51.320" end="00:13:52.720">you'll see some not work kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:13:52.720" end="00:13:57.340">took place and some of the sample apps that you'll get exposed to but also in terms of how</p>
      <p begin="00:13:57.340" end="00:14:01.350">our first party apps...they'll definitely they'll be part of that same</p>
      <p begin="00:14:01.350" end="00:14:05.070">...control set so...that we learn will put back into the ecosystem</p>
      <p begin="00:14:05.070" end="00:14:09.880">that allows you to grow and make your apps better so that's the part</p>
      <p begin="00:14:09.880" end="00:14:12.090">...make sure it's clear to</p>
      <p begin="00:14:12.090" end="00:14:15.540">...not just creating apps because we could do it ourselves we could do</p>
      <p begin="00:14:15.540" end="00:14:20.230">...way we want to do the one-way and one...together with you so</p>
      <p begin="00:14:20.230" end="00:14:27.800">...an exciting part of...design system.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:27.800" end="00:14:28.120">So, we've</p>
      <p begin="00:14:28.120" end="00:14:32.880">...chose I think the other part that we spend a lot of time on and</p>
      <p begin="00:14:32.880" end="00:14:37.940">carmen jeff we'll talk more about in their session at five o'clock is</p>
      <p begin="00:14:37.940" end="00:14:42.200">wow that's great you're doing all these controls but how do you scale it scaling is</p>
      <p begin="00:14:42.200" end="00:14:46.410">actually hits pretty tough problem and we've done a lot of work in going to</p>
      <p begin="00:14:46.410" end="00:14:51.850">share a lot about how we actually scaling your ux your design so that I can work</p>
      <p begin="00:14:51.850" end="00:14:56.510">on a folder tablet and pc and even other experiences so we thought a lot about how do</p>
      <p begin="00:14:56.510" end="00:15:00.490">we create effective pixels that makes it easier as a designer developer</p>
      <p begin="00:15:00.490" end="00:15:04.920">to design it so that looks right on the different devices and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:04.920" end="00:15:09.770">...something that like if you don't think about and you just kind of change it...different device</p>
      <p begin="00:15:09.770" end="00:15:14.410">or put in different target sometimes just doesn't look right so we spend a lot of time thing about how to create</p>
      <p begin="00:15:14.410" end="00:15:19.380">effective pace pixels and are scaling break point so definitely attend that session later on today</p>
      <p begin="00:15:19.380" end="00:15:24.240">at five to learn more about how we do not but also how you can do that for your apps</p>
      <p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:27.470">so you can effectively make sure you have the best experience</p>
      <p begin="00:15:27.470" end="00:15:34.890">on the devices that you want to target so, that's kind of our scaling effort?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:34.890" end="00:15:40.480">...without said we were also innovating internally how you take these control the scaling this</p>
      <p begin="00:15:40.480" end="00:15:45.850">universal windows platform and apply it to different applications just as</p>
      <p begin="00:15:45.850" end="00:15:50.690">you would and we've been looking at experiences like are media controls</p>
      <p begin="00:15:50.690" end="00:15:54.710">...be...just have one that you could use a few creating a media</p>
      <p begin="00:15:54.710" end="00:15:58.130">rich applications and be able scaled out and use</p>
      <p begin="00:15:58.130" end="00:16:03.560">it apply across all your all these different devices so we actually go to share some of those</p>
      <p begin="00:16:03.560" end="00:16:06.090">you control templates lynette and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:06.090" end="00:16:11.320">...will be sharing thatI think of the session on friday afternoon so that's another tool</p>
      <p begin="00:16:11.320" end="00:16:15.400">...give you...these are the same tools that we're building internally for</p>
      <p begin="00:16:15.400" end="00:16:19.900">...apps...we want to share but also get feedback on what else we need to do</p>
      <p begin="00:16:19.900" end="00:16:29.760">this in the system to make sure that are design works across all these different devices?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:29.760" end="00:16:34.430">And, then the part I talk about flooding I think I'm going to spend probably the necks part of</p>
      <p begin="00:16:34.430" end="00:16:38.730">...high presentation json flighty and why flighty is so critical</p>
      <p begin="00:16:38.730" end="00:16:42.310">and ahs all you a developers and are developing apps</p>
      <p begin="00:16:42.310" end="00:16:46.440">other within your company a or to consumers a customers</p>
      <p begin="00:16:48.840" end="00:16:55.510">flurry is actually let's my philosophy is you have to integrate to make things better there's, there's no</p>
      <p begin="00:16:55.510" end="00:17:00.350">perfect design other back to this tension...this balance there's always a sense of like</p>
      <p begin="00:17:00.350" end="00:17:05.280">well this is the right design or this is the perfect design and otherwise I dispelled</p>
      <p begin="00:17:05.280" end="00:17:09.980">out myth that we designing for billion devices you really trying</p>
      <p begin="00:17:09.980" end="00:17:14.720">to create the appropriate design, design...works for folks that</p>
      <p begin="00:17:14.720" end="00:17:19.690">for different context for different experiences but also allow you to tailor it and I think that's</p>
      <p begin="00:17:19.690" end="00:17:23.690">would be learning and that's why flying so important when we've</p>
      <p begin="00:17:23.690" end="00:17:29.970">...flooding ...the windows insider and, how many of your windows insiders hands up?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:29.970" end="00:17:35.860">That's awesome first I want to thank all you guys because it's been hard I know...kind of rough but,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:35.860" end="00:17:38.580">that's something that we're all used to and,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:38.580" end="00:17:43.820">I want to share with you kind of this next slide in terms of how we doing it so that you could say like</p>
      <p begin="00:17:43.820" end="00:17:47.860">...guys just putting things out there for the second results are no we really</p>
      <p begin="00:17:47.860" end="00:17:54.640">...on it and I think this is a...kind of funny for designer...graphs.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:54.640" end="00:17:57.620">...this one so on the right like I have</p>
      <p begin="00:17:57.620" end="00:18:01.990">suddenly gave wow we do a lot of work reiterating like this is a very different way of</p>
      <p begin="00:18:01.990" end="00:18:06.240">designing windows that we've done before so look at threshold windows ten the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:06.240" end="00:18:11.670">china right kind of gives you a sense of the orange that's how many days or percentage of our cycle</p>
      <p begin="00:18:11.670" end="00:18:16.400">we actually anyway we flooding something and taking...and</p>
      <p begin="00:18:16.400" end="00:18:20.400">...adjusting...design or updating features</p>
      <p begin="00:18:20.400" end="00:18:25.430">like that's proportionally to every other releases it's almost double and</p>
      <p begin="00:18:25.430" end="00:18:30.050">...terms of overall days we're actually much more faster like I said the team was</p>
      <p begin="00:18:30.050" end="00:18:34.850">look at threshold over just over a year-ago to say hey we have this great opportunity great create the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:34.850" end="00:18:40.500">universal windows platform and also move windows ahead and,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:40.500" end="00:18:44.820">we took that spirit and say let's flight let's iterate let's take on this promise</p>
      <p begin="00:18:44.820" end="00:18:49.130">that we want to make a better with our insider and contribute your</p>
      <p begin="00:18:49.130" end="00:18:51.530">ideas figure ideas and contribute to making</p>
      <p begin="00:18:51.530" end="00:18:55.520">our design how we move forward so,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:55.520" end="00:19:00.330">the orange...left really shows while we're doing much more much faster...also</p>
      <p begin="00:19:00.330" end="00:19:05.670">to...same amount time...innovationas windows eight or even windows seven so</p>
      <p begin="00:19:05.670" end="00:19:10.270">I'll hopefully got since we...feedback we are</p>
      <p begin="00:19:10.270" end="00:19:15.100">hearing on it we are learning from it and we are adjusting and,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:15.100" end="00:19:21.580">I think that's the great thing about this new design process we have...can do that?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:21.580" end="00:19:26.530">And, like I said lot of that is sometimes rough edges and if folks...seattle this is</p>
      <p begin="00:19:26.530" end="00:19:33.560">a...what I waterfront looks like right now those can be beautiful someday but.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:33.560" end="00:19:37.330">Like we knew that pay for lot-of folks really</p>
      <p begin="00:19:37.330" end="00:19:39.970">...giving you ...</p>
      <p begin="00:19:39.970" end="00:19:44.920">design that's probably not as complete boa could be that sometimes it's</p>
      <p begin="00:19:44.920" end="00:19:49.780">...still trying out sometimes that hey design hasn't been fully implemented or sometimes we just</p>
      <p begin="00:19:49.780" end="00:19:53.890">trying to learn and, it's going to be...a and for us inside the</p>
      <p begin="00:19:53.890" end="00:19:58.550">...how you see that like, you know, we have...like all...a bug here or the visually</p>
      <p begin="00:19:58.550" end="00:20:03.580">...up the right design and, work...use the conversation and I know for</p>
      <p begin="00:20:03.580" end="00:20:08.660">insiders when you download...up update your machine...phone you said whoa wait a minute</p>
      <p begin="00:20:08.660" end="00:20:12.510">existing the final product what I think that's the part I think we kind</p>
      <p begin="00:20:12.510" end="00:20:17.390">of have the restart level of understanding where hey we want to get those early because</p>
      <p begin="00:20:17.390" end="00:20:22.130">we want your feedback early and...will be rough and even internally we called dog</p>
      <p begin="00:20:22.130" end="00:20:26.890">feuding which...like...sometimes but I somehow I just want to</p>
      <p begin="00:20:26.890" end="00:20:32.120">...we really appreciate your feedback and,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:32.120" end="00:20:36.460">...hopefully understanding that you are hoping to contribute make it better but it will be</p>
      <p begin="00:20:36.460" end="00:20:38.590">rough a and.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:38.590" end="00:20:43.650">Designs I'm going to show you will hopefully show...has really fundamentally help</p>
      <p begin="00:20:43.650" end="00:20:49.870">...evolve...product and make it better even added new things so.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:49.870" end="00:20:55.170">Here's some of the feedback apply into designs and I think I want to focus this</p>

      <p begin="00:20:55.700" end="00:21:00.310">...learning especially with our phone flight one hundred fifty one</p>
      <p begin="00:21:00.310" end="00:21:03.110">which kamal pretty recently it was pretty rough</p>
      <p begin="00:21:03.110" end="00:21:07.410">...we knew that but, you also is again one make sure that you-get-a-chance and</p>
      <p begin="00:21:07.410" end="00:21:11.670">...we can...if you and try to understand...design</p>
      <p begin="00:21:11.670" end="00:21:16.650">...needs ago but also hopefully you-get-a-chance you understand</p>
      <p begin="00:21:16.650" end="00:21:21.550">where we're going with it so that when you're creating apps you get to learn from us so,</p>

      <p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:47.830">what what's up with that like what is the hamburger why is that in some ways I totally understand iso</p>
      <p begin="00:21:47.830" end="00:21:53.390">...from I'm hearing things I'm not trying to make light of it and, I want that feedback</p>
      <p begin="00:21:53.390" end="00:21:57.700">to be really clear that we are listening and we are learning and</p>
      <p begin="00:21:57.700" end="00:22:03.220">the hamburger if you step back and just let's just think about it whether they come from what how...</p>
      <p begin="00:22:03.220" end="00:22:08.540">become such a in some ways I would say ubiquitous control for ux</p>
      <p begin="00:22:08.540" end="00:22:12.600">if you go the websites...checking out what's happening withgamma</p>
      <p begin="00:22:12.600" end="00:22:16.430">phones or my facebook page or even</p>
      <p begin="00:22:16.430" end="00:22:20.590">...bankamerica how has it the...</p>
      <p begin="00:22:20.590" end="00:22:25.980">hamburger pattern I would say this control be become so prevalent I think I think I think</p>
      <p begin="00:22:25.980" end="00:22:31.480">...really speaks to the...of or the need for something</p>
      <p begin="00:22:31.480" end="00:22:35.230">...helps you navigate across your app as I think a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:22:35.230" end="00:22:39.840">...you are design apps...apps it's sometimes hard for someone to find like</p>
      <p begin="00:22:39.840" end="00:22:46.410">...what do I go to find the another section your app another area arts navigate</p>
      <p begin="00:22:46.410" end="00:22:51.970">in a hierarchy we...pretty deep I think the.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:51.970" end="00:22:55.440">The...control allows you to give that opportunity decree that</p>
      <p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:23:07.480">a global control...kind of like the home to your app.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:07.480" end="00:23:09.430">Hamburger.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:09.430" end="00:23:13.550">And, if you look at the history of...from...interesting back in I</p>
      <p begin="00:23:13.550" end="00:23:18.890">think eighty-one xerox park norm cox had the similar a challenge she was saying hey how do</p>
      <p begin="00:23:18.890" end="00:23:22.400">I create a since a place for my application where I</p>
      <p begin="00:23:22.400" end="00:23:27.190">could quickly navigate across my app and I think that's where it came from an out that was</p>
      <p begin="00:23:28.490" end="00:23:32.400">the problem-solving and I think it still does a good job of solving</p>
      <p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:37.590">...so in some ways it's not the hamburger that's at fault I guess</p>
      <p begin="00:23:37.590" end="00:23:41.900">that's the...look at is how...applied how do you create</p>
      <p begin="00:23:41.900" end="00:23:45.430">an icon a pattern allows you to create that since</p>
      <p begin="00:23:45.430" end="00:23:49.900">...place for your app and navigate across...app and,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:49.900" end="00:23:54.490">I think I think, you know, we've looked at ...designs well maybe it's...strikes</p>
      <p begin="00:23:54.490" end="00:24:00.530">...should be something else but in some ways it becomes such a familiar</p>
      <p begin="00:24:00.530" end="00:24:04.310">icahn I think that's where we landed right now and again,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:04.310" end="00:24:06.470">like I said I'll give feedback...</p>
      <p begin="00:24:06.470" end="00:24:11.270">get feedback from all you that's actually using this control which you could actually use</p>
      <p begin="00:24:11.270" end="00:24:14.730">...sdk and tried out but this is something</p>
      <p begin="00:24:14.730" end="00:24:19.650">out one we're still learning but also hoping the in the...other...</p>
      <p begin="00:24:19.650" end="00:24:25.170">sure if you were evolving how...this control and that evolution has taught us a couple</p>
      <p begin="00:24:25.170" end="00:24:30.320">things...cognitive jeff we'll share some more on that but the hamburger menu</p>
      <p begin="00:24:30.320" end="00:24:34.320">icon others for things that we have to remember we...use it</p>
      <p begin="00:24:34.320" end="00:24:39.280">and we're definitely trying to apply this now there is about navigation that's</p>
      <p begin="00:24:39.280" end="00:24:44.330">...given that sense of place create a clear hierarchy so you can navigate</p>
      <p begin="00:24:44.330" end="00:24:49.040">across your application but also making sure that he only use</p>
      <p begin="00:24:49.040" end="00:24:53.690">the hamburger...appropriate like for a keyboard mouse is actually really great you actually have slide</p>
      <p begin="00:24:53.690" end="00:24:57.390">...shows all the different areas but maybe for</p>
      <p begin="00:24:57.390" end="00:25:03.200">one how to use for on a mobile phone maybe...is not the best in show maybe the app</p>
      <p begin="00:25:03.200" end="00:25:08.400">...or pivots or even tabs can be a better controls and how do you</p>
      <p begin="00:25:08.400" end="00:25:12.790">...tailor your app for those different vices I think that's another thing</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.790" end="00:25:17.590">we're applying learning then optimizing content layout like I said when you have a phone</p>
      <p begin="00:25:17.590" end="00:25:23.050">call you have a smaller screen and obviously a pc how to take advantage of that and making sure</p>
      <p begin="00:25:23.050" end="00:25:27.470">...content is most important thing as more appropriate to use...what</p>
      <p begin="00:25:27.470" end="00:25:32.900">...do that and then think about again those different input when using keyboard versus</p>
      <p begin="00:25:32.900" end="00:25:38.630">keyboard mouse...touch how do you make sure ...control the hamburger doesn't in the way so</p>
      <p begin="00:25:38.630" end="00:25:43.785">that said that's the hammer...and will be the design a section there's going</p>
      <p begin="00:25:43.785" end="00:25:48.300">to be a lot more conversation and...make sure realistically again feedback and how</p>
      <p begin="00:25:48.300" end="00:25:54.960">in client-but also want to show you in some of the apps how we're doing it and...evolving?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:54.960" end="00:25:59.880">by far the number-one...that we got the most feedback specially in a recent flied is outlook and how</p>
      <p begin="00:25:59.880" end="00:26:04.820">we outlook users here hopefully a lot of great and you guys</p>
      <p begin="00:26:04.820" end="00:26:10.190">gals everyone in this room use outlook because it's a...productive tool</p>
      <p begin="00:26:10.190" end="00:26:15.330">and, email it's very rich very dense line information but,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:15.330" end="00:26:20.720">on the phone it's you have to take advantage of what's on the phone but also the constraints of</p>
      <p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:24.100">the phonetypically on our pc up you're kind of use</p>
      <p begin="00:26:24.100" end="00:26:27.270">...having these three areas having a list of folders</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.310" end="00:26:33.400">accounts and folders on the left and then the list of messages in the center and then</p>
      <p begin="00:26:33.400" end="00:26:38.350">the message item itself well on a for...ratio one of those and how do you how do you</p>
      <p begin="00:26:38.350" end="00:26:43.580">...again...the attention of hate only show what's appropriate as a</p>
      <p begin="00:26:43.580" end="00:26:49.720">climber experience so I think for us we're still learning how do you take advantage</p>
      <p begin="00:26:49.720" end="00:26:54.530">of controls...you to flex your app for the device and I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:54.530" end="00:26:59.290">show that the latest designers design...can be in the current coming...where?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:59.290" end="00:27:05.580">In the earlier flights you saw incomplete development of the command bar</p>
      <p begin="00:27:05.580" end="00:27:09.450">and, I want to...of all give to those to the outlook t because</p>
      <p begin="00:27:09.450" end="00:27:13.780">...been working very hard lobbies controls are actually new and</p>
      <p begin="00:27:13.780" end="00:27:18.740">they're billion from scratch I do like I said we...animal and,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:18.740" end="00:27:22.960">...have these controls that allows us to flex and adapt to</p>
      <p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:27.840">our different devices but now you see that...with those three pains that we had</p>
      <p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:33.630">on outlook we can actually create a simple wait for you to navigate to</p>
      <p begin="00:27:33.630" end="00:27:38.450">less we can use things like in-box your folders but also remain focus on the</p>
      <p begin="00:27:38.450" end="00:27:42.230">list of messages you have...dive in</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42.230" end="00:27:47.040">...message but also the thing this is important part have an app</p>
      <p begin="00:27:47.040" end="00:27:51.730">bar command bar that you could quickly access for most weekly use</p>
      <p begin="00:27:51.730" end="00:27:54.970">actions so it's not a instead of I thing</p>
      <p begin="00:27:54.970" end="00:28:00.270">...like well is a hamburger manures and app...it's actually using conjunction</p>
      <p begin="00:28:00.270" end="00:28:06.340">and, I j flexing are...enough flexibility so that you could adapted</p>
      <p begin="00:28:06.340" end="00:28:11.210">for your application make it more appropriate for the context but also for the tasks you want to help</p>
      <p begin="00:28:11.210" end="00:28:17.170">your customer achieve thing that's really important and showing more the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:17.170" end="00:28:21.000">Other the other feedback we gap a lot on was a</p>
      <p begin="00:28:21.000" end="00:28:25.770">unify in-box the ability to multi select quickly I mean those are things</p>
      <p begin="00:28:25.770" end="00:28:30.460">...team is looking at you start seeing that in our coming builds that we will have app...that's really</p>
      <p begin="00:28:30.460" end="00:28:35.680">quickly accessible and you can take action quickly on that item so,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:35.680" end="00:28:42.070">that's the control that were the team...is building and, getting into bills and,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:42.070" end="00:28:49.070">again, learning house of working...not feedback.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:49.070" end="00:28:54.220">It is not just the email itself...with take advantage of...we're all familiar with how do</p>
      <p begin="00:28:54.220" end="00:28:59.140">...integrate mail with calender ...seems like whoa hey that seems like</p>
      <p begin="00:28:59.140" end="00:29:04.260">...new idea but actually that's how...outlook has always been...was part of the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:04.260" end="00:29:09.320">...was part of mail and...came together I think with the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:09.320" end="00:29:12.920">universal windows platform app of outlook now we billion</p>
      <p begin="00:29:12.920" end="00:29:18.440">...together the other team is making sure that the counters quickly accessible within the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:18.440" end="00:29:20.880">email outlook experience and then if you</p>
      <p begin="00:29:20.880" end="00:29:26.110">want to switch two different views I think that's the other feedback we want to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:26.110" end="00:29:30.380">our mission redress how do we get two million many counter in ones</p>
      <p begin="00:29:30.380" end="00:29:36.290">is all five-one you could actually get to that calendar but you have to actually...tap on...on...a</p>
      <p begin="00:29:36.290" end="00:29:40.560">...date now we can actually make done an action on the command</p>
      <p begin="00:29:40.560" end="00:29:44.330">...and app are and quickly access that so those are the things I want</p>
      <p begin="00:29:44.330" end="00:29:48.310">to make sure that we're addressing that we are trying to make sure it is</p>
      <p begin="00:29:48.310" end="00:29:51.960">appropriate of experiences but also make things easily accessible from one</p>
      <p begin="00:29:51.960" end="00:29:54.190">...use so you see it's all located in the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:54.190" end="00:30:03.970">bottom the screen so it's easy for you to reach of one hand.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:03.970" end="00:30:08.480">And, then the other couple apps I want to talk about in terms of experience revolving I think</p>
      <p begin="00:30:08.480" end="00:30:14.010">that people one it's we've had people unfold four-bit and I think the gallo</p>
      <p begin="00:30:14.010" end="00:30:18.730">feedback on hey where people round or whatever you circles...times</p>
      <p begin="00:30:18.730" end="00:30:23.200">has skip away from like the overall design system but more talk about are kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:30:23.200" end="00:30:28.110">our thinking we reset on windows send one of the key things outwe</p>
      <p begin="00:30:28.110" end="00:30:33.090">really appreciable...phone system was people was a center of your experience and we want</p>
      <p begin="00:30:33.090" end="00:30:37.560">to celebrate that we...make sure that's really important and when you in start or you when you looking</p>
      <p begin="00:30:37.560" end="00:30:42.730">...annapolis how do you make sure people stand out and the thing that we want</p>
      <p begin="00:30:42.730" end="00:30:46.820">...was this idea of using circles reps and people to...you at least have</p>
      <p begin="00:30:46.820" end="00:30:49.990">this visual hierarchy but also celebrate the fact that these</p>
      <p begin="00:30:49.990" end="00:30:53.640">are people the people you care about so that's the one of reasons</p>
      <p begin="00:30:53.640" end="00:30:58.480">...we decide what people in circles and we're going to try to allegheny give us feedback but</p>
      <p begin="00:30:58.480" end="00:31:05.820">I think this helps really in our system the kind of how people stand out from the rest of the design?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:05.820" end="00:31:10.650">And, then we photos again, this idea of adapting and learning I think</p>
      <p begin="00:31:10.650" end="00:31:14.850">that adaptive ux is new so in photos the pc apple washer</p>
      <p begin="00:31:14.850" end="00:31:21.760">of familiar photos collection album where we can make it easy for you to</p>
      <p begin="00:31:21.760" end="00:31:26.200">sword and create collections and albums but also how do you make it</p>
      <p begin="00:31:26.200" end="00:31:28.690">easier navigate and with menu</p>
      <p begin="00:31:28.690" end="00:31:33.400">icon hamburger other keyboard mouse is pretty effective to navigate but for</p>
      <p begin="00:31:33.400" end="00:31:40.090">phone what we shown or tribe is hey, you could actually take advantage of</p>
      <p begin="00:31:40.090" end="00:31:45.040">...where you why you swipe you want use a pivot control...where adapting</p>
      <p begin="00:31:45.040" end="00:31:49.750">...tailoring that have that same app the same photo app to have</p>
      <p begin="00:31:49.750" end="00:31:53.250">...pivot controls so this hopefully shows you that we</p>
      <p begin="00:31:53.250" end="00:31:58.120">are adjusting we are learning but we also appliance idea of adaptive ux into a designs</p>
      <p begin="00:31:58.120" end="00:32:06.300">armoire apps and sharing that with you so, I...shows you the flexibility...system.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:06.300" end="00:32:11.230">The last one I want toggle in this is a work-in-progress and...edge</p>
      <p begin="00:32:11.230" end="00:32:16.320">...new browser it's a contemporary browser it's but it's going to graphics engine that's all</p>

      <p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:40.185">...sentence more feedback but, also I</p>
      <p begin="00:32:40.185" end="00:32:45.490">think tried out trial new...and unless know-how isn't working so I just</p>

      <p begin="00:33:16.160" end="00:33:21.690">trying to feedback on that so since more feedback on...you think about...which</p>
      <p begin="00:33:21.690" end="00:33:26.800">...I think the other areas we continue to evolve and learn is really around this</p>
      <p begin="00:33:26.800" end="00:33:31.550">idea of how do we continue the flight?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:31.550" end="00:33:35.310">But, also continue to evolve are design</p>
      <p begin="00:33:35.310" end="00:33:38.860">...the pc and phone so things like haul</p>
      <p begin="00:33:38.860" end="00:33:45.160">...things like I'll...you-get-a-chance on the our team...think about how do you</p>
      <p begin="00:33:45.160" end="00:33:49.000">may universal windows apps work on all those system so we also</p>
      <p begin="00:33:49.000" end="00:33:54.620">want to feedback on that and,...the if you...get to trial hall and I think</p>
      <p begin="00:33:54.620" end="00:33:59.620">...really speaks you how are design systems evolving even to the future and those are</p>
      <p begin="00:33:59.620" end="00:34:03.510">...that we're considering and thinking about in terms of mccann design</p>
      <p begin="00:34:03.510" end="00:34:10.700">better and more flexible and more taylor and more adaptive and.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.700" end="00:34:15.330">I think...we're not just say hey we're going to design windows all of night it's</p>
      <p begin="00:34:15.330" end="00:34:20.260">...evolution and we are continue to push design forward just a little</p>
      <p begin="00:34:20.260" end="00:34:22.750">glimpse like we are continues evolve</p>
      <p begin="00:34:22.750" end="00:34:26.410">the desktop you are thinking about how a gate how do you</p>
      <p begin="00:34:26.410" end="00:34:30.960">flex system how you strong colors typography</p>
      <p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:35.680">design elements...is just a little glimpse that hates not this is not this</p>
      <p begin="00:34:35.680" end="00:34:40.650">...bill...an on where continue to evolve are design system</p>
      <p begin="00:34:40.650" end="00:34:45.740">...it's cohesive it's universal but also making things more personal</p>
      <p begin="00:34:45.740" end="00:34:50.550">and, tailored windows the tensions that we want to work with you to kind of help create that like</p>
      <p begin="00:34:50.550" end="00:34:55.920">balance so have not said there's a lot more to share and I wish I could go on a bit more</p>
      <p begin="00:34:55.920" end="00:35:00.500">and there's sessions the next couple days of is also design area that you get some</p>

      <p begin="00:35:19.340" end="00:35:24.510">the tools that we've been will be handed out odep center ok,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:24.510" end="00:35:29.880">that's the presentation session and we're going to go into a little q in a</p>
      <p begin="00:35:29.880" end="00:35:34.250">...fortunate today to actually have some more folks...teamjeff</p>
      <p begin="00:35:34.250" end="00:35:46.130">fong who leads windows design so he's been a key part of our design team...for jeff.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:46.130" end="00:35:49.370">And, then also...kessler who's our content publishing</p>

      <p begin="00:35:59.260" end="00:36:08.200">...store the dead-center and even the upgrade experience so cool.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:08.200" end="00:36:13.550">...q and a.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:13.550" end="00:36:24.010">Anyone questions.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:24.010" end="00:36:27.580">I said a quick question I mean everything that goes into the core platform goes</p>
      <p begin="00:36:27.580" end="00:36:30.350">across all devices so like, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:30.350" end="00:36:35.080">would say the outlook was when...programs that goes across the phone windows</p>
      <p begin="00:36:35.080" end="00:36:38.670">...lands and the xbox one which I think</p>
      <p begin="00:36:38.670" end="00:36:44.280">it's just I don't know where is it just...like...</p>
      <p begin="00:36:44.280" end="00:36:47.700">So, it's a universal windowsplatform</p>
      <p begin="00:36:47.700" end="00:36:52.750">...so...on the same frameworks the control set of</p>
      <p begin="00:36:52.750" end="00:36:55.960">...currently is a focus on the phone and pc experience</p>
      <p begin="00:36:57.650" end="00:37:04.190">...pollens you can run universal windows platform maps...that's more of us</p>
      <p begin="00:37:04.190" end="00:37:08.870">...have were can iterate and tried out so...some of xbox it doesn't</p>
      <p begin="00:37:08.870" end="00:37:14.170">...you have to its and...can...and also...question is like,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:14.170" end="00:37:21.100">you know, so,...win-lose...school often.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:21.100" end="00:37:26.250">The universe windows platform like actually go to thesession tomorrow we're</p>
      <p begin="00:37:26.250" end="00:37:31.180">going to talk about some of the media controls so some aspects of the platform</p>
      <p begin="00:37:31.180" end="00:37:36.170">will be more readily for xbox but there's no announcement on is</p>
      <p begin="00:37:36.170" end="00:37:42.200">someone actually announce like...not going to email on tv but, I think is really about the tools</p>
      <p begin="00:37:42.200" end="00:37:56.310">and controls ip create on xbox and on conan pc.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:56.310" end="00:37:57.170">Any other questions.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:58.330" end="00:38:03.720">Where you get...so ...did you collect the data for how people use those</p>
      <p begin="00:38:03.720" end="00:38:08.520">different platforms and that type of things that they do on those?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:08.520" end="00:38:13.270">You know, because obviously you can watch a full-length movie or not obviously...might say you can watch</p>
      <p begin="00:38:13.270" end="00:38:18.320">a full-length will be...your big-screen maybe not going to sit there for our on your tablet or your phone</p>
      <p begin="00:38:18.320" end="00:38:25.650">...collect that data or how did you send out surveys or to handle that?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:25.650" end="00:38:29.900">...user research, yeah, so, there's a combination of what we</p>
      <p begin="00:38:29.900" end="00:38:36.610">...research team that actually goes out and we do usability testing we do.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:36.610" end="00:38:41.950">...and talk to our customers so, that's one part of how we gather data the other part of it</p>
      <p begin="00:38:41.950" end="00:38:45.590">is looking at, you know, you know the...the data</p>
      <p begin="00:38:45.590" end="00:38:50.130">...were getting a through the flights and...a combination of those two things</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50.130" end="00:38:54.310">...at behavior across different devices that inform us on how we</p>
      <p begin="00:38:54.310" end="00:39:00.750">optimize the designs across the different devices and I'll just...this is like a new frontier for us we</p>
      <p begin="00:39:00.750" end="00:39:18.400">spend a lot of time and windows...engineering engagement system and telemetry.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:18.400" end="00:39:20.990">...one of the things that unconscious of looking</p>
      <p begin="00:39:20.990" end="00:39:25.400">at windows ten technical previews is the difference between the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:25.400" end="00:39:30.340">can feel the when thirty-two access that exist and also the new universal...</p>
      <p begin="00:39:30.340" end="00:39:37.940">that now exist I'm just wondering how you see that now...mean...</p>
      <p begin="00:39:37.940" end="00:39:42.910">you got the win thirty-two...a legacy thing that we should really focus on the new-style.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:42.910" end="00:39:44.080">And, leave that the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:44.080" end="00:39:48.290">...old...to the cough themselves as well will be</p>
      <p begin="00:39:48.290" end="00:39:52.490">and design guide...for both within thirty two and for universal</p>
      <p begin="00:39:52.490" end="00:39:57.690">...or how do you how do you see this evolving I mean would</p>
      <p begin="00:39:57.690" end="00:40:02.400">you expect that windows maybe in some future date that when thirty-two type of design</p>
      <p begin="00:40:02.400" end="00:40:09.450">...disappear or do you expect them to be side-by-side for the foreseeable future?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:09.450" end="00:40:14.000">...question and there's different parts of there's one the design and there's the guidelines I could talk a little bit about</p>
      <p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:16.930">...the design things we're doing right nowwith windows</p>
      <p begin="00:40:16.930" end="00:40:21.800">...is a challenge to think about the legacy stuff that we have within all the one-thirty to absent and</p>
      <p begin="00:40:21.800" end="00:40:26.970">...you know,...legacy code...the same time we're looking at maybe some</p>
      <p begin="00:40:26.970" end="00:40:30.620">lightweight things we could do to help kind of bring...to work together looking at some of the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:30.620" end="00:40:36.830">...controls...potentially...those controls that we bring at least a little more harmony across</p>
      <p begin="00:40:36.830" end="00:40:41.790">the new universal space as well as a...to space...looking at some lightweight things we could do to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:41.790" end="00:40:47.420">kind...of those things together as far as guidelines are concerned.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:47.420" end="00:40:51.670">...you'll see that what we did today with you look at the dead-center and</p>
      <p begin="00:40:51.670" end="00:40:56.370">we have design guidance that we've just published today and we're certainly optimizing for what</p>
      <p begin="00:40:56.370" end="00:41:00.870">we're doing right now around the universal windows platform</p>
      <p begin="00:41:00.870" end="00:41:05.290">so taking that and then understanding where we need to tailor our own content</p>
      <p begin="00:41:05.290" end="00:41:09.940">...presentation to all of you to think about where are those places where the line</p>
      <p begin="00:41:09.940" end="00:41:14.830">start to blur and how might you think about what we've had in the past whether it makes sense to bring</p>
      <p begin="00:41:14.830" end="00:41:17.920">a forward and that's and evolution that we need to continue to</p>
      <p begin="00:41:17.920" end="00:41:24.810">do with our design guidance as well so we'll be doing that so I'm glad you asked that question?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:24.810" end="00:41:30.570">Input is really interesting part of that question which iswe've all...windows team since windows</p>
      <p begin="00:41:30.570" end="00:41:34.880">...at least so windows seven in classic desktop is awesome</p>
      <p begin="00:41:34.880" end="00:41:39.730">from mouse and keyboard right it's fantastic and that design works for that and then the pendulum</p>
      <p begin="00:41:39.730" end="00:41:44.270">sort of swung arguably a little too far towards the touch spectrum and</p>
      <p begin="00:41:44.270" end="00:41:48.830">...eight I think we're going back now is like this really nice balance for windows tune is</p>
      <p begin="00:41:48.830" end="00:41:52.180">great for touch and mouse and keyboard so the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:52.180" end="00:42:02.580">design you'll see coming outmicrosoft is this is trying to get the sweet spot.</p>

      <p begin="00:43:08.250" end="00:43:13.250">a that's a very brought we do everything so right...and, I think</p>
      <p begin="00:43:14.720" end="00:43:19.930">...million insiders that's also a very effective set of feedback that we</p>
      <p begin="00:43:19.930" end="00:43:21.535">get okay but I</p>
      <p begin="00:43:21.535" end="00:43:26.160">think more importantly other one of the things that we tried you at least even early on in design</p>
      <p begin="00:43:26.160" end="00:43:31.640">is really understand what is scenario what is howdy actually ...got something ...share more</p>
      <p begin="00:43:31.640" end="00:43:36.050">...design process and saying what was the task you're trying to achieve</p>
      <p begin="00:43:36.050" end="00:43:39.370">but really think of the context...the scenarios we actually do</p>
      <p begin="00:43:39.370" end="00:43:43.470">storyboards we do mock-up and back to this theme of</p>
      <p begin="00:43:43.470" end="00:43:49.400">innovations the quicker you could do a mock-up the quicker you do something code even that's why</p>
      <p begin="00:43:49.400" end="00:43:51.810">...fun and developers the quickie</p>

      <p begin="00:43:57.500" end="00:44:03.530">the better so, one of the things that I think that's so exciting about the way we've been...windows...is</p>
      <p begin="00:44:03.530" end="00:44:08.060">...ability to get out there get our designs out there so my encouragement is like it's not about</p>

      <p begin="00:44:36.130" end="00:44:40.170">Well,...there's a back to there's the what is</p>
      <p begin="00:44:40.170" end="00:44:44.200">...prizes...like anything like there's unexpected may</p>
      <p begin="00:44:44.200" end="00:44:49.250">...orders this tension like some of the things we met we</p>

      <p begin="00:44:52.780" end="00:44:57.390">sometimes I came across as being like hey you just doing this and,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:57.390" end="00:45:02.460">I think that's what...a designer I was one of the design team like we try things out it's a</p>

      <p begin="00:47:44.040" end="00:47:48.560">we're sharing and we will be evolving that as far as what we see</p>
      <p begin="00:47:48.560" end="00:47:54.190">in material versus what we have out there today think of what we're doing today is sort of</p>

      <p begin="00:47:59.500" end="00:48:03.720">to think about as you're trying to design and implement the things that you're seeing a show</p>
      <p begin="00:48:03.720" end="00:48:08.670">you this weekend and we're on that journey towards popping that up</p>
      <p begin="00:48:08.670" end="00:48:13.190">and giving more expression to some of the thinking philosophy around it and some of the things that algorithm</p>

      <p begin="00:48:15.110" end="00:48:18.950">and, actually that's what emphasizes pointers is tension</p>
      <p begin="00:48:18.950" end="00:48:22.940">and it's something that was actually in design...struggle with that you</p>
      <p begin="00:48:22.940" end="00:48:27.590">can be very prescriptive insight like do this and don't do this and,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:27.590" end="00:48:32.520">not be very...just say like well we did this way you guys should try it out and I think</p>
      <p begin="00:48:32.520" end="00:48:34.090">we're trying to find...</p>
      <p begin="00:48:34.090" end="00:48:38.770">were like things like hey the app art it has to be there the</p>

      <p begin="00:49:01.500" end="00:49:05.840">...that balance where should be this is one way that makes it easy for</p>

      <p begin="00:49:13.510" end="00:49:20.120">by all of you helping us contribute to are design guidelines so?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:20.120" end="00:49:24.620">Like I think a great to great next steps for to address that would be like go-go to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:24.620" end="00:49:28.090">...and carmen's session and five because you're going to get into</p>
      <p begin="00:49:28.090" end="00:49:30.020">...much more specifics and go to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:30.020" end="00:49:35.100">...dot windows dot com which just got launched today it's awesome new</p>
      <p begin="00:49:35.100" end="00:49:39.650">...consolidated developer center and you will see design guidelines</p>
      <p begin="00:49:39.650" end="00:49:48.610">there that like these are saying we constantly evolving those but there's a lot there right now.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:48.610" end="00:49:54.510">...unnoticed you've of...feedback about hamburg menus but,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:54.510" end="00:49:58.380">she didn't really necessary address how you in a so fix some of the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:58.380" end="00:50:03.350">concerns think that the biggest concern from people who've use windows phone of the</p>
      <p begin="00:50:03.350" end="00:50:08.160">is perhaps the hamburger menus ...see...top left the...same</p>
      <p begin="00:50:08.160" end="00:50:12.720">...concern with the with the browser and the...was just wondering if</p>
      <p begin="00:50:12.720" end="00:50:18.390">...in a...ios...I can sweat from the edge and axis and bergman you</p>
      <p begin="00:50:18.390" end="00:50:24.790">...to type in the top left...just one if you thinking about that to address the concerns,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:24.790" end="00:50:31.080">yeah, well, yeah, so, we're definitely in the concerns I think, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:31.080" end="00:50:34.390">one thing is too and, you know,...like cake,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:34.390" end="00:50:40.620">you know, the stuff that we have before windows phone the pivots...all those controls they still exist and,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:40.620" end="00:50:44.860">the hamburgers...just another tool and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:44.860" end="00:50:50.350">that you can use to designer apps and our intent was...we think about it is the</p>
      <p begin="00:50:50.350" end="00:50:55.940">hamburgers a great tool for people to kind of navigate large sections of an application</p>
      <p begin="00:50:55.940" end="00:51:00.270">which is probably...of a seldom perform task than being,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:00.270" end="00:51:04.850">you know, a deep within a section of an application as far as the gesture</p>
      <p begin="00:51:04.850" end="00:51:09.930">...of open the...hamburger we thought about that's not something that's not</p>
      <p begin="00:51:09.930" end="00:51:13.770">consult the...considered right now mainly because a hamburger and</p>
      <p begin="00:51:13.770" end="00:51:18.180">a pivot can exist together so we still want to maintain that flexibility appeal</p>
      <p begin="00:51:18.180" end="00:51:22.160">to just slight left and right really quickly to switch fuse within</p>
      <p begin="00:51:22.160" end="00:51:25.320">...you know, within a part of an application and,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:25.320" end="00:51:35.490">that would conflict with ...as well but and, you...carmen just session</p>
      <p begin="00:51:35.490" end="00:51:40.850">...later today I think that's the guidance we...more specifically like...example I</p>
      <p begin="00:51:40.850" end="00:51:45.100">...of outlook how they're looking to...use actions the</p>
      <p begin="00:51:45.100" end="00:51:49.580">...menu icon with a command bar and app or that's where you most</p>
      <p begin="00:51:49.580" end="00:51:55.780">...use task are so it's I...make sure it's not a it's not hamburger or nothing I think it's</p>
      <p begin="00:51:55.780" end="00:52:00.410">how do you actually create a system that creates up my balance an appropriate and</p>
      <p begin="00:52:00.410" end="00:52:04.580">...for the different devices so definitely that session later today at five</p>
      <p begin="00:52:04.580" end="00:52:09.570">...warm afterwards we're here to talk more and actually learn more what</p>
      <p begin="00:52:09.570" end="00:52:14.530">ideas you have for your app that you want implement...just one quick</p>
      <p begin="00:52:14.530" end="00:52:20.800">...and with the design of ios apps android apps and now windows that's kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:52:20.800" end="00:52:25.460">solve...same suicide...the windows epsy you guys...as the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:25.460" end="00:52:31.310">base appsvery similar to android equivalence I'm just curious where you came from a design</p>
      <p begin="00:52:31.310" end="00:52:35.880">perspective and what you can offer that unique to someone wanted by windows phone</p>
      <p begin="00:52:35.880" end="00:52:40.000">featuring the...on five years ago you design</p>
      <p begin="00:52:40.000" end="00:52:44.360">...feedback them is very clear is very different differentiate against</p>
      <p begin="00:52:44.360" end="00:52:49.890">competition now it seems like it's kind of going the same way there's one what you guys are going to</p>
      <p begin="00:52:49.890" end="00:52:57.330">do free-market design perspective to defray png differentiate the windows phone experience?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:57.330" end="00:53:01.800">...different...something were let's step back and like my type...journey five years ago</p>
      <p begin="00:53:01.800" end="00:53:07.760">I think transportation graphics massimo those the international topographic</p>
      <p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:12.750">stiles timeless...inspiration and in some ways we want to design we timeless</p>
      <p begin="00:53:12.750" end="00:53:17.120">...want to be like hey this year is this style and the next year we're going to put white</p>
      <p begin="00:53:17.120" end="00:53:18.110">...your car</p>
      <p begin="00:53:18.110" end="00:53:24.300">...like we want to create a system that will evolve over time and,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:24.300" end="00:53:27.020">hopefully be...laid-off foundation with</p>
      <p begin="00:53:27.020" end="00:53:30.970">far design our system we can continue evolve and</p>
      <p begin="00:53:30.970" end="00:53:36.270">the evolution of that is really about create experiences that helps you differentiate</p>
      <p begin="00:53:36.270" end="00:53:41.350">thing that's why evolving experiences like core tanner or even spartan</p>
      <p begin="00:53:41.350" end="00:53:46.550">...browsers I think...even holland you can start seeing where designs these bobbing</p>
      <p begin="00:53:46.550" end="00:53:52.930">too and, those are things... we want-to make sure that we have a haveare</p>
      <p begin="00:53:52.930" end="00:53:56.340">designed to capability a system that can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:53:56.340" end="00:54:00.810">adapt in flex you all those different experiences and I think that's why</p>
      <p begin="00:54:02.180" end="00:54:06.670">our designs evolving to allow us to make it more universal?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:06.670" end="00:54:10.840">Yeah, I think it's part of our learning process now too as we kind of think about</p>
      <p begin="00:54:10.840" end="00:54:13.980">what we first approach...this idea of designing universal</p>
      <p begin="00:54:13.980" end="00:54:18.580">...and thinking about how we could create a user experiences across different form</p>
      <p begin="00:54:18.580" end="00:54:24.550">factors we started thinking ik how can we actually...create one system that works across everything and,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:24.550" end="00:54:28.500">over the course of, you know,...the...of the last year we're</p>
      <p begin="00:54:28.500" end="00:54:32.690">fine ik maybe it makes more sense first optimized for certain devices</p>
      <p begin="00:54:32.690" end="00:54:37.420">and experiences so that the expenses really stand out more so as we kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:54:37.420" end="00:54:41.820">start pushing things apart...but I think you'll see a little more expression coming through</p>
      <p begin="00:54:41.820" end="00:54:43.930">of the designs but ultimately,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:43.930" end="00:54:47.190">you know, our primary goal kind of back to you...inspiration</p>
      <p begin="00:54:47.190" end="00:54:52.020">was kinda helping the user the customer really understand what's going on within the system and</p>
      <p begin="00:54:52.020" end="00:54:59.050">really that's what our focuses not so much as, you know, making a statement which is important, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:59.050" end="00:55:03.180">we...ours are design...but also ultimately to make sure that</p>
      <p begin="00:55:03.180" end="00:55:10.980">sar customer trapping they know how to...navigate the system as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:10.980" end="00:55:16.310">In the latest versions of the phone version of windows</p>
      <p begin="00:55:16.310" end="00:55:20.920">were saying some changes in how the start screens being rendered in terms of the spacing</p>
      <p begin="00:55:20.920" end="00:55:26.370">between the tiles can you talked a little bit and how that's going to impact the</p>
      <p begin="00:55:26.370" end="00:55:31.100">use of backgrounds on phone because it doesn't look like this very much room in between</p>
      <p begin="00:55:31.100" end="00:55:35.860">the tiles any longer for the background the to show through and also from a consistency sam point</p>
      <p begin="00:55:35.860" end="00:55:39.740">looks to be kind of different from what you're seeing on the start screen in the desktop</p>
      <p begin="00:55:39.740" end="00:55:45.630">...as well as the smaller tablet buildsand, we can talk about,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:45.630" end="00:55:51.580">yeah, so, ...might look a little bit different...should, you know,...spacey between</p>
      <p begin="00:55:51.580" end="00:55:57.970">film between the phone the tablets and desktop the unit</p>
      <p begin="00:55:57.970" end="00:56:02.150">it's working off of the same...grid system is a very</p>
      <p begin="00:56:02.150" end="00:56:06.740">...amazing the...designers work in a start...to think about how this, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:06.740" end="00:56:10.230">this grid system works across all these different devices</p>
      <p begin="00:56:10.230" end="00:56:16.270">...sizes and different pixel densities was actually quite complicated problem but,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:16.270" end="00:56:21.310">we are...a similar layouts across all those things regarding the background</p>
      <p begin="00:56:22.470" end="00:56:30.760">for the phone it is tighter between the two areas but we have is the previous</p>
      <p begin="00:56:30.760" end="00:56:35.140">fun, you know, we have the background kinda show through the tiles will...support that</p>
      <p begin="00:56:35.140" end="00:56:39.730">...as a way for the background to show through and we're also looking attransparency so they</p>
      <p begin="00:56:39.730" end="00:56:46.170">can actually look at the background and...spacing that we're...build is the final spacing on the</p>
      <p begin="00:56:46.170" end="00:56:56.220">...the start for phone I think it's pretty close so yeah, I think that's right...</p>
      <p begin="00:56:56.220" end="00:56:58.800">Two more questions a couple of weeks...</p>
      <p begin="00:56:58.800" end="00:57:04.380">ago you publish first overview of what you're doing with the hamburger</p>
      <p begin="00:57:04.380" end="00:57:08.690">icon and I think that this is very interesting the way you</p>
      <p begin="00:57:08.690" end="00:57:13.360">...I like what you did because as soon as the screen get</p>
      <p begin="00:57:13.360" end="00:57:19.080">bigger the you know, what is a transit transient ux became a</p>
      <p begin="00:57:19.080" end="00:57:22.260">...because it's open automatically from what</p>
      <p begin="00:57:22.260" end="00:57:27.750">understand I would like to know do you plan to do something similar</p>
      <p begin="00:57:27.750" end="00:57:31.950">...that have bar because you...you know, so,...of time you need to purses</p>
      <p begin="00:57:31.950" end="00:57:36.940">...why on phone but as soon as you get on a...huge phone?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:36.940" end="00:57:42.100">It's not...more...tab that you would like its you would like doze</p>
      <p begin="00:57:42.100" end="00:57:46.480">...to expansive that they are always that people don't just cone.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:46.480" end="00:57:48.040">One robot the</p>
      <p begin="00:57:48.040" end="00:57:52.860">...for rover semantically because it's getting bigger uf</p>
      <p begin="00:57:52.860" end="00:57:56.950">plans to help us on that side in the future.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:56.950" end="00:58:01.780">...and it's a huge it's a huge issue right now because...I'm using a tab</p>
      <p begin="00:58:02.880" end="00:58:07.570">...this is a very natural you user control</p>
      <p begin="00:58:07.570" end="00:58:12.070">so is it what is going to be the behavior when I'm getting it on a twenty-seven inches</p>
      <p begin="00:58:12.070" end="00:58:15.750">the screen and if it's a tab that means they'll be probably.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:16.760" end="00:58:23.110">A...this space where there's nothing in it because it's...so you</p>
      <p begin="00:58:23.110" end="00:58:28.390">...so...I may one this year you...if I could by program should say</p>
      <p begin="00:58:28.390" end="00:58:35.200">...just morphine the so that you just give more generally</p>
      <p begin="00:58:35.200" end="00:58:40.810">the user that's a gooddesign challenge like violence and are actually we</p>
      <p begin="00:58:40.810" end="00:58:45.320">...to multiple tabs jan additional content you might have the idea is that I</p>
      <p begin="00:58:45.320" end="00:58:51.510">don't want just...show me three-fourths...different alive right now</p>
      <p begin="00:58:51.510" end="00:58:55.690">and user depending on where the based on the, yeah, that's something I'm not sure</p>
      <p begin="00:58:55.690" end="00:58:59.330">...exploring but that's I think that's a good part of the session we can</p>
      <p begin="00:58:59.330" end="00:59:04.380">follow-up on so there's nothing you're going to discuss...this week about</p>
      <p begin="00:59:04.380" end="00:59:34.690">that what something in the in your right now in on the...</p>
      <p begin="00:59:34.690" end="00:59:36.740">For example, take right now the facebook</p>
      <p begin="00:59:36.740" end="00:59:41.040">app which you stab probably facebook if they have like twenty-seven</p>
      <p begin="00:59:41.040" end="00:59:45.660">shoot inches you would want you to see the for tabs alive right</p>
      <p begin="00:59:45.660" end="00:59:50.090">now not having you to switch because it makes sense so this is the type of issue</p>
      <p begin="00:59:50.090" end="00:59:54.000">that I'm facing right now also in our control support the scaleability but you know, I</p>
      <p begin="00:59:54.000" end="01:00:05.410">...says there's also other things you could do well within the toolkit.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:14.600" end="01:00:18.350">So, that means that will that I will have to decide to decide to</p>
      <p begin="01:00:18.350" end="01:00:22.670">...bar and show something else instead of adding at the boss that more for</p>
      <p begin="01:00:22.670" end="01:00:31.470">...for me so less works to do on...</p>
      <p begin="01:00:31.470" end="01:00:37.470">Great okay thank you are last question heavy-weight...it seems like all</p>
      <p begin="01:00:37.470" end="01:00:43.100">the design issues and...search are driven in large part</p>
      <p begin="01:00:43.100" end="01:00:49.370">...form factors and how you fit things into different form factors?</p>
      <p begin="01:00:49.370" end="01:00:53.980">So, you have small screens and big screens and all that kinda stuff and all of those screens have</p>
      <p begin="01:00:53.980" end="01:00:59.550">frames around them I was watching the whole and stem this morning and</p>
      <p begin="01:00:59.550" end="01:01:01.740">occur to me that.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:01.740" end="01:01:06.270">In that environment you don't really have a display device you don't actually really have a</p>
      <p begin="01:01:06.270" end="01:01:07.660">frame.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:07.660" end="01:01:12.370">So, that in my mind perhaps opens up your design</p>
      <p begin="01:01:12.370" end="01:01:16.690">capabilities a lot into something entirely different, you know,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:16.690" end="01:01:20.690">that's not necessarily just taking an old application with</p>
      <p begin="01:01:20.690" end="01:01:24.980">a rectangular frame and now displaying it on some surface that perhaps</p>
      <p begin="01:01:24.980" end="01:01:29.810">is not rectangular as wondering whether you had any thoughts about how you're going to push</p>
      <p begin="01:01:29.810" end="01:01:35.800">that design envelope in a technology that.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:35.800" end="01:01:39.800">Involves things like...that's...part we're still</p>
      <p begin="01:01:39.800" end="01:01:43.840">...and how...so new for all of us even amongst ourselves that</p>
      <p begin="01:01:43.840" end="01:01:46.730">...closely experimenting and the team is</p>
      <p begin="01:01:46.730" end="01:01:52.440">literally prototyping every day and, hooked like I said definitely go tried</p>
      <p begin="01:01:52.440" end="01:01:57.620">...and right now you can run a universal windows platform app on a</p>
      <p begin="01:01:57.620" end="01:02:00.850">two-d experience but that doesn't like you said that take advantage</p>
      <p begin="01:02:00.850" end="01:02:05.080">...a holographic and how you actually create holographic apps other</p>
      <p begin="01:02:05.080" end="01:02:08.970">...something we're building together...and?</p>
      <p begin="01:02:08.970" end="01:02:11.570">We got a lot to learn and,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:11.570" end="01:02:17.060">how to...design system to support that thank you great hey thank you everyone for a saying</p>
      <p begin="01:02:17.060" end="01:02:19.990">...great session and please give feedback the</p>
      <p begin="01:02:19.990" end="01:02:24.360">...backwards for the session...of blog post today particular can</p>
      <p begin="01:02:24.360" end="01:02:28.960">capture some of this thinking we also have a space down the hall that said, you know, get</p>
      <p begin="01:02:28.960" end="01:02:32.990">...consultation around design so feel free to take advantage and all that</p>
      <p begin="01:02:32.990" end="01:02:39.120">stuff right thank you?</p>
