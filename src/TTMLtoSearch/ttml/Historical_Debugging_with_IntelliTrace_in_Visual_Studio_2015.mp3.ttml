      <p begin="00:00:04.320" end="00:00:07.540">All right let's get started.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.540" end="00:00:11.860">Thank you for coming especially since this the last session on the last</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.860" end="00:00:18.890">day you guys might not know me but as far as I'm concerned you're my best friend.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.890" end="00:00:19.470">So, my name</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.470" end="00:00:24.960">is anglos that row plus and big surprise I'm originally from greece.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.960" end="00:00:28.960">A move to the uk to study where I got my bachelor's and master's</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.960" end="00:00:34.170">in software engineering if you're wondering why I wasted my time getting a masters</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.170" end="00:00:38.630">...engineering is because I really wanted to come to the us one day and work and the really</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.630" end="00:00:43.190">helps with the process so here I am working in visual studio...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:44.300" end="00:00:50.520">Being the product manager for the program manager for inhibitors.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.520" end="00:00:53.200">How many of you out of this room have use</p>
      <p begin="00:00:53.200" end="00:00:58.490">intelligence before or are familiar with it so quite a few people that's great I just</p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.490" end="00:01:03.400">want-to make sure that everybody gets exactly what the expect of the session so,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.400" end="00:01:08.310">I want to briefly mention the...this is a debugging feature from one</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.310" end="00:01:14.230">that's code that means we don't support cplus-plus right now and even though you can download</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.230" end="00:01:16.090">...of visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.090" end="00:01:19.420">twenty fifteen right now and you can play with all of the features including</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.420" end="00:01:24.210">...so you'll be able to replicate exactly what a...today when we hit</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.210" end="00:01:27.350">...them intelligence is going to be part of the enterprise</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.350" end="00:01:31.080">...so bone if you stay until the end of the session</p>
      <p begin="00:01:31.080" end="00:01:38.500">you really hate debugging anything else...coding enterprise you buying that...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.500" end="00:01:42.040">Mandatory slide if you guys like what you see you want to singing</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.040" end="00:01:49.680">again in the future please let-me know...you like that so that they will invite me back advances force myself.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:52.440">So, this session is going to be about how can</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.440" end="00:01:57.870">intellectually is health you to be more productive during the daily debugging.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.870" end="00:02:02.500">If your writing code you also fixing it up least I have never seen</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.500" end="00:02:07.420">a job posting that says csharp developer needed to write new code don't worry about fixing</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.420" end="00:02:09.280">it we have another guy for that.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:10.650">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:10.650" end="00:02:15.610">So, often...the fix a bug in an application where.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.610" end="00:02:20.340">You can work in small increments make a few changes in very quickly...your changes and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.340" end="00:02:26.040">that's great because you can very quickly figure out if something goes wrong is probably what adjusting.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.040" end="00:02:26.890">But, I find</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.890" end="00:02:31.730">that's typically the exception to the rule usually something else</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.730" end="00:02:36.170">is happening usually I'm being asked to fix a bug maybe in a part of the application that I didn't</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.170" end="00:02:38.830">right because I'm working in a team and one of my colleagues</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.830" end="00:02:43.080">wrote it so I'm not really sure how that part of the application works.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:47.060">All I need to fix a bag...takes ten or fifteen minutes to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:47.060" end="00:02:52.030">set up to make...ready to replicate...the stupid thing of stepping over</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.030" end="00:02:55.460">...into and I break my keyboard on...frustrated.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.760" end="00:03:00.840">Or...new team when you project and I don't know the code base</p>
      <p begin="00:03:00.840" end="00:03:05.510">very well and I want to be productivethe one of the want anybody to think I don't...to code that just</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.510" end="00:03:09.470">don't understand the application yet that's need some time to...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.470" end="00:03:14.160">Or you...be my home code but I wrote the long-time ago and...don't know...you guys but whenever</p>
      <p begin="00:03:14.160" end="00:03:20.320">look back...code the wrote the past hosting who wrote that stupid...do that way.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:20.320" end="00:03:22.900">So, again, you might have different thoughts.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.900" end="00:03:26.940">Or you might be one of those bags...some users reporting it or you're seeing it</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.940" end="00:03:30.130">in the test environment but it's really hard replicated on your local machine.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:31.140" end="00:03:35.750">Or you don't know exactly how it happens you click around the latin you do a lot of things and by the end with</p>
      <p begin="00:03:35.750" end="00:03:39.710">...but you don't really know-how you got there.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.710" end="00:03:44.560">out of curiosity who here has never had to deal with any of this.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:48.230">Nobody ok good excellent so at least you can see the value</p>
      <p begin="00:03:48.230" end="00:03:53.480">here now there's one more way that we can helpcan help you be more efficient</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.480" end="00:03:57.850">...debugging other than just fixing bugs like that you will also</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.850" end="00:04:02.930">be able to spot unexpected behavior even if you're not looking for</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02.930" end="00:04:06.700">...a bit like magic right now butI'll show you exactly how that works</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.700" end="00:04:12.420">...and it really helps when you fix about before somebody files?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.420" end="00:04:13.760">So, how the system's going to play</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.760" end="00:04:18.720">out is very quickly I'm going to explain what intelligence can do?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:21.310">Then we're going to dive into a demo where we're</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21.310" end="00:04:26.240">going to compare what it's like to fix the same bug with intelligence and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:32.950">without so during this demo I'm actually going to be using intelligence...if you all know how it</p>
      <p begin="00:04:32.950" end="00:04:35.630">...stop and explained every ui element and everything</p>
      <p begin="00:04:35.630" end="00:04:40.250">...clicking on because what I wanted to take away from it is are you convinced</p>
      <p begin="00:04:40.250" end="00:04:44.500">that it's actually saving you time and if we spend fifteen twenty minutes talking to everything,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:44.500" end="00:04:48.480">you know, going to take that away from it so we're going to go rather quickly through that but</p>
      <p begin="00:04:48.480" end="00:04:52.770">...keep take away from that is not exactly how it works but how did</p>
      <p begin="00:04:52.770" end="00:04:55.860">I go about my debugging...briefly</p>
      <p begin="00:04:55.860" end="00:05:00.760">pose and have a little retrospective into the demo and then we're going to take a deeper</p>
      <p begin="00:05:00.760" end="00:05:05.550">...when explained everything...clicking on everything that I'm using all the way elements</p>
      <p begin="00:05:05.550" end="00:05:12.700">...there and I'll be able to take questions ...answer and,...you wondering about?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12.700" end="00:05:16.880">Finally within a wrap-up where...a...what we talked about plus</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.880" end="00:05:21.800">...going to give you a little pointers to some other intellectually functionality that I think most</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.800" end="00:05:27.830">of you will find really interesting but I just don't have time to democratic.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:27.830" end="00:05:31.330">So, what...intelligence do?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31.330" end="00:05:32.800">Basically what your...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:32.800" end="00:05:37.260">is running without you having to do anything special rather than just...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:37.260" end="00:05:42.010">on internal trace will monitored for what it considers interesting</p>
      <p begin="00:05:42.010" end="00:05:48.080">events so what's what is an interesting event let's take a look at some examples this is not an exhaustive list</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:53.620">is a some examples let's say you just study debugging and you're accessing some files to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.620" end="00:05:58.110">read some configuration and then the user clicks on the button.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58.110" end="00:06:01.110">And, then later on you execute some sequel.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:01.110" end="00:06:04.150">...maybe...exception gets thrown somewhere.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.150" end="00:06:08.680">Now for this kind of events in penetrates things that you might be interested in what the state of the application</p>
      <p begin="00:06:08.680" end="00:06:13.120">wars when they were generated so what we'll do is</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.120" end="00:06:17.240">...will look at the application state when adtext them and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:17.240" end="00:06:21.270">...remember the...and some local information for this event</p>
      <p begin="00:06:21.270" end="00:06:26.200">allowing you later on to go back in time and asked hey what was the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:26.200" end="00:06:32.570">calls that when I read those configuration files even though now you might be all the way down...exception.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:32.570" end="00:06:35.170">So, let's go straight into them.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.170" end="00:06:38.930">And, I'm going to help here when I am debugging without</p>
      <p begin="00:06:38.930" end="00:06:42.740">...because I want to the...honest I'm not going to cook for</p>
      <p begin="00:06:42.740" end="00:06:49.910">them to make it look good so you're going to help me debug this application...oppressed are.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.910" end="00:06:54.070">And, this is a very simple wpf text editor</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.070" end="00:06:58.280">...us has the ability to open a text file make some changes save them</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.280" end="00:07:01.480">...so I'm going to just that when I...open?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:02.580" end="00:07:05.100">I'm going to select the text file the contents really</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.100" end="00:07:09.890">done matter for this bug so I'm going to school to the bottom.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:09.890" end="00:07:13.770">I'm going to show you the when I make some edits?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.770" end="00:07:19.080">And, then I'm about to save them what happens is I lose my current context my...going to move up to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:19.080" end="00:07:19.800">the top so</p>
      <p begin="00:07:19.800" end="00:07:24.800">...escobar so I'm going to click on save now you see that everything has been kind of reset</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:31.340">and with the...so this is the bug on address now what would you guys to first.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:31.340" end="00:07:35.310">...question honestly what...the first.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:35.310" end="00:07:38.880">Yeah, what I heard is we're going to take a look at the event handler for the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:43.360">save button right I mean that's what I would definitely do so go to the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:43.360" end="00:07:45.340">...the break point other very first-line?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:53.270">Open my application repeat...testing steps.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:53.270" end="00:07:58.760">Now...I do you can...the code right you make a bigger.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:58.760" end="00:08:00.020">I want to give you a minute just</p>
      <p begin="00:08:00.020" end="00:08:06.230">...this code if anything looks suspicious let-me know if you want to change something.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.230" end="00:08:14.010">Because I'll just...to see if anything we...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:14.010" end="00:08:16.460">One seventy two text file content the focus</p>
      <p begin="00:08:16.460" end="00:08:19.840">...suspicious I agree I've been bitten by those things the...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:20.850" end="00:08:26.370">So, I'm just going to...using editing continue anything else.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.370" end="00:08:31.390">Okay, cool so I'm just going to quickly stepped...to see if anything goes wrong</p>
      <p begin="00:08:31.390" end="00:08:34.130">...unexpected anything abnormal</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.130" end="00:08:38.720">...everything looks fine we're getting the bites from the textbooks...them to the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:38.720" end="00:08:46.560">file unseen exceptions all right let's see if committing out that...a five.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:52.960">Unfortunately...still lost my current position on the master and describers</p>
      <p begin="00:08:52.960" end="00:08:57.970">So, what's next.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:57.970" end="00:09:01.240">The...what about...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:01.240" end="00:09:06.760">...the other positions.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:06.760" end="00:09:09.980">Technical call...when you're at the break point ok</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.980" end="00:09:10.680">...other suggestions.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.830" end="00:09:19.630">Whether this...binding ok so basically at this point we all</p>
      <p begin="00:09:19.630" end="00:09:24.190">very quickly decided let's go take a look at the...of the save button we all kind of thought that's</p>
      <p begin="00:09:24.190" end="00:09:29.090">what the problem is it seems pretty simple we took a look nothing is obvious and</p>
      <p begin="00:09:29.090" end="00:09:33.720">now we're trying to find other ways that we can find interesting places to put a break</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.720" end="00:09:38.650">...so basically what I'm hearing now is I'm going to explore the code a little bit maybe step into a few</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.650" end="00:09:44.230">things I'm going to explore basically I'm not really sure what to do next so let me show you how without knowing</p>
      <p begin="00:09:44.230" end="00:09:47.810">anything more about this code we can altogether solve this bug using...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:49.210" end="00:09:51.140">...close.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:51.140" end="00:09:58.720">And, here's a quick that for you guys I'm...get rid of the break point because I don't need it.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:04.250">And, I want to enable...trace which you can do through tools options but,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:04.250" end="00:10:10.540">in case you...didn't know you can actually search for pretty much everything at the very top will actually</p>
      <p begin="00:10:10.540" end="00:10:14.950">...for-youwhether it's a menu item or options...very quickly go from here to</p>

      <p begin="00:10:36.180" end="00:10:40.560">...ask...hey what have you recorded from the let's take a look about now</p>
      <p begin="00:10:40.560" end="00:10:45.360">intended trace let's look at its data when the...has broken and I don't have a break point</p>
      <p begin="00:10:45.360" end="00:10:50.560">anyway I'm not particularly interested in a specific line of code so I'm going to use the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:55.670">recall functionality that basically is the equivalent of every thread getting</p>
      <p begin="00:10:55.670" end="00:11:01.650">a break point exactly what it so I'll do that and what resources telling me is that</p>
      <p begin="00:11:01.650" end="00:11:06.050">...with broken in a place where you don't have any of your code so I'm not going to show you</p>
      <p begin="00:11:06.050" end="00:11:08.720">...but I don't care because the reason I use that was to look</p>
      <p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:13.470">...temperatures so I'm going to look at this diagnostics tools window?</p>
      <p begin="00:11:13.470" end="00:11:18.080">This is the list of every event that...says has...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:18.080" end="00:11:24.600">When I read through it I see up here there's a clicked open event that's me clicking the</p>
      <p begin="00:11:24.600" end="00:11:28.950">Button...is a file access and file close.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:28.950" end="00:11:33.120">That makes sense because when you read the file you first open it then you read the contents and then you</p>
      <p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:37.090">closer when I see a clicked save.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:37.090" end="00:11:39.860">Event lets me making the changes including save.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:40.890" end="00:11:42.910">And, then I see a file access</p>
      <p begin="00:11:42.910" end="00:11:46.730">follow close file access and foreclosure length.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:46.730" end="00:11:51.610">And, this is suspicious I don't quite understand why after save the file</p>
      <p begin="00:11:51.610" end="00:11:57.680">I would open savy...opening again enclosure again so at this point</p>
      <p begin="00:11:57.680" end="00:12:02.220">already have a better idea of what...going on in this actually kind of make sense from reopening the file</p>
      <p begin="00:12:02.220" end="00:12:06.900">after save it could explain why everything kind of gets reset and everything moves up</p>
      <p begin="00:12:06.900" end="00:12:10.620">to the top but if we're being honest you have a</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.620" end="00:12:15.610">good-looking framework and you don't mind scrolling some text files and you don't mind not having this</p>
      <p begin="00:12:15.610" end="00:12:20.150">cool integrative experience you can get similar information from things like look for</p>
      <p begin="00:12:20.150" end="00:12:23.680">...but what you can't get is the very next.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:23.680" end="00:12:27.240">...all wondering right now is...why do we have to pairs</p>
      <p begin="00:12:27.240" end="00:12:31.930">both access and close like...they called twice.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:31.930" end="00:12:34.040">What I can do with intelligence...I couldn't do with</p>
      <p begin="00:12:34.040" end="00:12:38.870">the logging tool is I can just click on this event that looks interesting to me which is the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:38.870" end="00:12:46.830">first file access after click save and then click on activate historical debugging?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:46.830" end="00:12:52.160">Now what happens now is the entire id...historical debugging mode as you can see</p>
      <p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:56.990">...the very top of thing...says historical debugging the text editor</p>
      <p begin="00:12:56.990" end="00:13:01.540">showing the line of code that was executed when that event with generated</p>
      <p begin="00:13:01.540" end="00:13:05.380">...me that I was in the save file.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:05.380" end="00:13:11.510">Button vendor and this is exactly the code that...for before so this looks normal.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:11.510" end="00:13:12.090">Now what I want</p>
      <p begin="00:13:12.090" end="00:13:16.980">to do is take a look at the rest of them this close one is probably going to be the end of the using statement but</p>
      <p begin="00:13:16.980" end="00:13:22.730">what I make sure okay yep the editor has shown that the event was generated by the end of</p>
      <p begin="00:13:22.730" end="00:13:27.190">the using statement now...really want to find out is what is the second file</p>
      <p begin="00:13:27.190" end="00:13:32.270">...all about so...to select that one and activities organ bugging.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:32.270" end="00:13:35.170">Now my text editor has moved into the refile</p>
      <p begin="00:13:35.170" end="00:13:39.640">method...makes no sense I have no idea why we file...called of the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:39.640" end="00:13:44.560">...so what I'm curious now is who cold refile.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:50.030">Now there's an info...here letting me know the id...historical debugging and the there</p>
      <p begin="00:13:50.030" end="00:13:54.990">are some debugged windows are participating in this experience so if I click on</p>
      <p begin="00:13:54.990" end="00:13:56.390">...stuck.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:56.390" end="00:13:58.690">I see that the cost of windows says also historical</p>
      <p begin="00:13:58.690" end="00:14:03.060">debugging brackets that means that this window is actually showing me the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:03.060" end="00:14:06.370">...actually...at that moment in time.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:06.370" end="00:14:07.670">What I can tell hear from the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:07.670" end="00:14:11.520">...that is that refile is called by open file?</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.520" end="00:14:17.100">Again, this doesn't help me because I'm not really sure...be calling open file of the save I see that open</p>
      <p begin="00:14:17.100" end="00:14:19.820">file is called from on file chains.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:19.820" end="00:14:23.850">And, that from...school from this anonymous methods.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:23.850" end="00:14:29.570">Now this anonymous method is actually the event hunger of the file system...your.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:29.570" end="00:14:33.300">As it turns out the root cause of the...is not the same functionality</p>
      <p begin="00:14:33.300" end="00:14:36.850">it's actually different piece of functionality that allows users to edit</p>
      <p begin="00:14:36.850" end="00:14:41.330">the same document basically if I have a document open and somebody else</p>
      <p begin="00:14:41.330" end="00:14:45.540">opens the same document and makes changes the application detects that and</p>
      <p begin="00:14:45.540" end="00:14:48.910">...shows me a warning telling me five save right now I'm going to overwrite somebody</p>
      <p begin="00:14:48.910" end="00:14:53.690">else's but it looks like we have a bug and when I save my own changes</p>
      <p begin="00:14:53.690" end="00:14:58.910">I tell myself to reload myself so like any good demo the bug can be</p>
      <p begin="00:14:58.910" end="00:15:02.400">...commenting something?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:02.400" end="00:15:04.840">So, here's where the...was on my unfold sense of an</p>
      <p begin="00:15:04.840" end="00:15:08.130">...I'm just going to continue and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:08.130" end="00:15:19.280">when application continuous...the bottom make my changes...</p>
      <p begin="00:15:19.280" end="00:15:24.380">So, thank you.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:24.380" end="00:15:25.590">Now...fully</p>
      <p begin="00:15:25.590" end="00:15:30.580">appreciate what intelligence has to offer me here think about your typical debugging</p>
      <p begin="00:15:30.580" end="00:15:35.490">routine as soon as you see a bug you first thought is where I'm going to put the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:35.490" end="00:15:40.150">...point that is close enough to the root cause of the bag of what vessel but it</p>
      <p begin="00:15:40.150" end="00:15:45.760">hasn't gone over it and we're going to make our best guess tested by repeating</p>
      <p begin="00:15:45.760" end="00:15:47.860">...testing steps...probably not going to get</p>
      <p begin="00:15:47.860" end="00:15:52.240">...the very first-time around so we're going to step through code maybe get a better idea put another</p>
      <p begin="00:15:52.240" end="00:15:57.150">break point and we're going to keep going through this loop until we get close enough to finally figure out the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:57.150" end="00:16:03.290">changes will make so the idea is that you spend a lot of time trying to find the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:03.290" end="00:16:08.070">bug and that's no valuable what's actually valuable is fixing it so what you want to get</p>
      <p begin="00:16:08.070" end="00:16:10.650">the records as fast as possible.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:10.650" end="00:16:14.340">Now within telly trace when you see a bug your first</p>
      <p begin="00:16:14.340" end="00:16:17.580">...be our...yet let's see what</p>
      <p begin="00:16:17.580" end="00:16:22.670">infiltrate has recorded hopefully it's actually going to...me to the root cause of the...like</p>
      <p begin="00:16:22.670" end="00:16:27.570">...did in this example but even if it doesn't even if the...hiding in between those interesting</p>
      <p begin="00:16:27.570" end="00:16:32.660">events...get a better idea of what's going on and I'm probably going to be able to eliminate some</p>
      <p begin="00:16:32.660" end="00:16:37.320">of my hypothesis some of my possible scenarios and I will probably be able to place the break</p>
      <p begin="00:16:37.320" end="00:16:43.250">...later on...a much better accuracy to get to the records much quicker.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:43.250" end="00:16:51.320">So,...a very quick demonstration now we're going to do the deep dive.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:01.340" end="00:17:06.320">I'm sorry I didn't quite understand the question.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:06.320" end="00:17:09.200">Can I put some code...generation events and let me answer the question</p>
      <p begin="00:17:09.200" end="00:17:14.660">...leather on the short answer is you cannot do it through code but there's other ways you can do and</p>
      <p begin="00:17:14.660" end="00:17:19.269">let me answer the question after we complete this demos...flows...</p>
      <p begin="00:17:19.269" end="00:17:20.109">So, let me close.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:21.189" end="00:17:26.189">So, now we're going to work...different application this is an actual</p>
      <p begin="00:17:26.189" end="00:17:29.229">application it's kind of all school because I got it from called</p>
      <p begin="00:17:29.229" end="00:17:34.599">...I didn't want to cook something up I wanted to actually use a real application so, it's a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:34.599" end="00:17:39.079">...forms application that uses a database to maintain...a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:39.079" end="00:17:45.049">list of social club members basically you can registered members and search for them so I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:17:45.049" end="00:17:50.460">to just that I'm going to register myself by filling in just a required fields?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:51.470" end="00:17:54.370">That's not my real...by the way.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:54.370" end="00:17:57.780">Suffix now engineer married and let's be</p>
      <p begin="00:17:57.780" end="00:18:04.950">...could lose some weight when I register the application is registering me</p>
      <p begin="00:18:04.950" end="00:18:10.980">...here...decision was successful and the bug...been asked to fix is that the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.980" end="00:18:15.780">get all search functionality is behaving kind of erratically I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:18:15.780" end="00:18:20.010">told that sometimes it returns records that nobody ever entered so</p>
      <p begin="00:18:20.010" end="00:18:22.100">...help about?</p>
      <p begin="00:18:22.100" end="00:18:27.390">Cyclic...and I got one record which is the one that I actually inserted</p>
      <p begin="00:18:27.390" end="00:18:32.640">...looks that looks like the right data and have another record...has some fields are empty some have</p>
      <p begin="00:18:32.640" end="00:18:37.400">different values I definitely didn't enter that one so I'm not real sure</p>
      <p begin="00:18:37.400" end="00:18:41.190">what this result is awaits coming from?</p>
      <p begin="00:18:41.190" end="00:18:45.240">Now this point I'm thinking either there's something wrong when I register the member</p>
      <p begin="00:18:45.240" end="00:18:49.740">in the first-time or there's something wrong with the way I'm retrieving the results and I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:18:49.740" end="00:18:55.140">and I'm creating invalid records so the application actually has one more type of</p>
      <p begin="00:18:55.140" end="00:18:58.220">sets functionality has the ability to...occupation and</p>
      <p begin="00:18:58.220" end="00:19:02.310">...others so I think what I want to do is I want to search for this record</p>
      <p begin="00:19:02.310" end="00:19:04.150">that has all the unknowns.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:04.150" end="00:19:08.460">And, I want to see if that actually returns because if it returns and maybe</p>
      <p begin="00:19:08.460" end="00:19:14.300">...real recording database so I clicked serves searching for known and unknown.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:14.300" end="00:19:15.660">And, now I'm really confused because</p>
      <p begin="00:19:15.660" end="00:19:21.460">...back...the first record and I really have no idea what's going on.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:21.460" end="00:19:25.030">...the debug this application...we don't know what the start time maybe output and event</p>
      <p begin="00:19:25.030" end="00:19:29.380">...the get all sorry break point on the event handler of get all maybe</p>
      <p begin="00:19:29.380" end="00:19:33.210">a look at the register I'm really very uncomfortable</p>
      <p begin="00:19:33.210" end="00:19:40.420">placing a break point right now so instead what I'm going to do is I'm going to break all just like before.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:40.420" end="00:19:45.940">And, we're going to talk more about this diagnostics tools window and calories so...</p>
      <p begin="00:19:45.940" end="00:19:50.710">only use this list of events down here and I think that's pretty straightforward every event</p>
      <p begin="00:19:50.710" end="00:19:53.810">that intelligence records in this...</p>
      <p begin="00:19:53.810" end="00:19:57.020">I didn't talk about is what's all of this up here.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:57.020" end="00:20:01.890">So, up here I can see my diagnostic session counting down and because some kind in the breaks</p>
      <p begin="00:20:01.890" end="00:20:05.880">...has...so basically this window records replication</p>
      <p begin="00:20:05.880" end="00:20:10.930">wallets executing but while you're taking...time to debug exposing and...waiting for you to the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:10.930" end="00:20:16.720">...then right below it there is this debugged events timeline</p>
      <p begin="00:20:16.720" end="00:20:18.090">...we call.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:18.090" end="00:20:20.880">This these exactly the same data</p>
      <p begin="00:20:20.880" end="00:20:27.040">...listed here exactly the same events are actually shown in the graphical view</p>
      <p begin="00:20:27.040" end="00:20:31.410">Events over time so you can see how they relate to each other.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:31.410" end="00:20:37.670">Now we're breaking up this one list into three timeline...</p>
      <p begin="00:20:37.670" end="00:20:42.100">The first one is break events so every time you to break point you take a step you're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:20:42.100" end="00:20:45.290">...event here and because I just hit the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:45.290" end="00:20:49.440">brake all button on the ...of the like a</p>
      <p begin="00:20:49.440" end="00:20:54.100">hundred and two seconds into the into my debugging session has created a break event</p>

      <p begin="00:20:58.010" end="00:21:01.890">...output events this is typically anything that would go to the</p>
      <p begin="00:21:01.890" end="00:21:06.890">output window integers records and brings into this view so if you use the output window to look at your</p>

      <p begin="00:21:09.940" end="00:21:15.540">are here and finally we have every other event...recorded in the table</p>
      <p begin="00:21:15.540" end="00:21:21.080">...in the final truck now if you look at this is last to tracks.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:21.080" end="00:21:23.040">And, use quinton...really hard</p>
      <p begin="00:21:23.040" end="00:21:26.860">like so hard that you can see a little bit into the future.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:26.860" end="00:21:31.540">You might actually see them being sone truck.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:31.540" end="00:21:34.140">Anyway.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:34.140" end="00:21:38.080">So, I really have no idea what to start so I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:40.740">...using timeline to orient myself.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:40.740" end="00:21:44.800">When hover over the very first event but...has collected from the in the</p>
      <p begin="00:21:44.800" end="00:21:49.420">...struck and I see that's the gesture of me clicking the login button</p>
      <p begin="00:21:49.420" end="00:21:52.670">...I'm...to scroll of I'm going to movement mouse over to</p>
      <p begin="00:21:52.670" end="00:21:57.530">the next event and that's the gesture of...the register button</p>
      <p begin="00:21:57.530" end="00:22:01.210">then I can see there's a cluster of events here there's a big space?</p>
      <p begin="00:22:01.210" end="00:22:05.530">And, then there's another event which is...get all now I'm not really sure</p>
      <p begin="00:22:05.530" end="00:22:10.470">what the buggies ways of the beginning or the end so I'm going to get one-step-at-a-time I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:22:10.470" end="00:22:15.340">to drag left click and...with my mouse to select the time around this</p>
      <p begin="00:22:15.340" end="00:22:19.980">cluster of events that seems to be related with me clicking the register button.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:19.980" end="00:22:22.340">So, I'm going to select them.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:22.340" end="00:22:26.770">And, I'm going to write click and says...selection now this that to things</p>
      <p begin="00:22:26.770" end="00:22:30.960">...first of all zoomed in a little bit so I can see all of those events were cramping a</p>
      <p begin="00:22:30.960" end="00:22:35.720">little bit more spaced out of the same time...did is filter might table</p>
      <p begin="00:22:35.720" end="00:22:40.480">view underneath here...that...so...no longer dealing with every event</p>
      <p begin="00:22:41.620" end="00:22:44.750">...only dealing with the events that happened when I clicked register.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:45.870" end="00:22:49.800">Now just looking at this list of events.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:49.800" end="00:22:55.430">I immediately sports a couple of inches statements...the bottom and they seem to be both</p>
      <p begin="00:22:55.430" end="00:23:00.230">...to the same table so that's not something that I expect.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:00.230" end="00:23:04.900">So, if I click on the very first one I actually get to see the sequel that was executed</p>
      <p begin="00:23:04.900" end="00:23:07.010">by application looks like an</p>
      <p begin="00:23:07.010" end="00:23:10.120">...statement into club members</p>
      <p begin="00:23:10.120" end="00:23:15.480">has a bunch of parameters okay I'm going to...down and look at the second one which</p>
      <p begin="00:23:15.480" end="00:23:21.170">seems very similar this again is also doing and insert into club members.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:21.170" end="00:23:24.910">I see...some differences in the parameters there and I see some now so that's very</p>
      <p begin="00:23:24.910" end="00:23:28.120">suspicious so I'm pretty sure what's happening is when I</p>
      <p begin="00:23:28.120" end="00:23:33.360">...the first-time...actually inserted to records in the database and the search</p>
      <p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:35.990">...the real results.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:35.990" end="00:23:42.710">my next question is why is happening twice so I'm going to click on the very first event the very first</p>
      <p begin="00:23:42.710" end="00:23:46.900">insert statement and...debugging again.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:46.900" end="00:23:51.500">I see that...in the create method seems normal look at the call stack.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:51.500" end="00:23:55.080">I see that the creative fold from register...</p>
      <p begin="00:23:55.080" end="00:23:55.440">Obtained</p>
      <p begin="00:23:55.440" end="00:24:00.150">...normal and registered members called by register underscore click.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:00.150" end="00:24:05.370">...noises without I'm going to move on to the other...statement at the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:05.370" end="00:24:10.250">activate historical debugging on that one and I'm thinking back to the same create method</p>
      <p begin="00:24:10.250" end="00:24:15.390">...let's look at the...for this one this time</p>
      <p begin="00:24:15.390" end="00:24:19.950">creators called again by register member...everything's the same so far but</p>
      <p begin="00:24:19.950" end="00:24:23.430">when I see the register member is called by button register</p>
      <p begin="00:24:23.430" end="00:24:29.000">underscore mouse click so this is a really silly bug of basically have to have been how...for the same</p>
      <p begin="00:24:29.000" end="00:24:35.510">...I didn't I forgot that I already had it so had the twice so the bug is a simple as that.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:35.510" end="00:24:40.760">Any questions so far.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:50.440" end="00:24:54.290">So, the question is whether the events that we're seeing here</p>
      <p begin="00:24:54.290" end="00:25:04.800">...because we're using a dot net and the answer is yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:04.800" end="00:25:06.430">So, I definitely have at least one bug</p>
      <p begin="00:25:06.430" end="00:25:17.640">right I can then fix it go back and test of my search again and see if there's another but there.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:17.640" end="00:25:21.040">All right pretty straightforward I'll keep going.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:21.040" end="00:25:25.460">So, what I want to show you next?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:25.460" end="00:25:29.090">...let me...debugging first.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:29.090" end="00:25:32.040">...is how you can solve some common problems using</p>
      <p begin="00:25:32.040" end="00:25:35.280">...you so how we can be helpful doing general</p>
      <p begin="00:25:35.280" end="00:25:40.210">debugging but I want to show you some other things as well some specific scenarios where you when</p>
      <p begin="00:25:40.210" end="00:25:45.670">you see that scenario you mind immediately goes okay I'm going to use intelligence to show this out.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:45.670" end="00:25:49.740">So, I don't know-how many of you do...how many of you here do ace encode</p>
      <p begin="00:25:49.740" end="00:25:54.310">you to use the new wasting functionality to fire off work on a different thread and then</p>
      <p begin="00:25:54.310" end="00:25:59.120">...await to do very quick multi-threaded application but one</p>
      <p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:03.580">of the very most common big issues is that when you're a synchronous code</p>
      <p begin="00:26:03.580" end="00:26:07.920">...exception it actually...visual studio on the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:07.920" end="00:26:14.780">await not with the exception was thrown let me show you what I mean by that...start.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:14.780" end="00:26:20.940">This is a very simple w application has only one-button I'm going to click it.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:20.940" end="00:26:25.890">And, somewhere I'm throwing...exception...visual studio very...breaks execution from</p>
      <p begin="00:26:25.890" end="00:26:30.530">because it's not handled by anyone and tells me that whatever you're doing.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:30.530" end="00:26:35.530">Underneath months something a strong...exception but I don't actually know where</p>
      <p begin="00:26:35.530" end="00:26:39.930">...okay my first instinct is let's look inside here...was going on here.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:39.930" end="00:26:45.500">Ok, well, there's no exception being thrown here...have to keep digging and the more complex your ace</p>
      <p begin="00:26:45.500" end="00:26:46.990">...is...of a</p>
      <p begin="00:26:46.990" end="00:26:52.420">...to find this so what if I told you that if you just</p>
      <p begin="00:26:52.420" end="00:26:56.730">go to intelligence and click on the event that says exception</p>
      <p begin="00:26:57.740" end="00:27:00.910">...activate...it takes exactly the line of code the</p>
      <p begin="00:27:00.910" end="00:27:07.370">threat so there's no guesswork there's no looking for code there's no understanding how things are...</p>
      <p begin="00:27:07.370" end="00:27:17.150">You just go to the list click active-x so debugging either.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:17.150" end="00:27:20.790">Now I said before that you can be more efficient while</p>
      <p begin="00:27:20.790" end="00:27:25.050">you're debugging a bug but you can also be more efficient because you can fix a bug before someone</p>
      <p begin="00:27:25.050" end="00:27:28.360">files now what do they mean by that.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:28.360" end="00:27:29.470">Let's say that I'm working</p>
      <p begin="00:27:29.470" end="00:27:34.390">and application like the one by the show you now which is a very simple client-server application</p>
      <p begin="00:27:34.390" end="00:27:39.270">hp dot net and it's basically a contact manager you can add contacts</p>
      <p begin="00:27:39.270" end="00:27:42.980">...details remove them I'm going to just that.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42.980" end="00:27:48.070">I'm going to the brand-new context when I click save.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:48.070" end="00:27:52.570">...click remove, remove save.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:52.570" end="00:27:56.090">Remove everything seems to work just fine.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:56.090" end="00:28:03.060">So, let's say that for whatever reason I broke into my editor at some point in</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.060" end="00:28:06.440">I wasn't looking for...bug...hit a break point or I'm writing some code</p>
      <p begin="00:28:06.440" end="00:28:10.700">immediately what catches my eye on the intelligence timeline is a...thing what is...thing</p>
      <p begin="00:28:10.700" end="00:28:14.680">...highlighted...the time.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:14.680" end="00:28:15.610">The list below</p>
      <p begin="00:28:15.610" end="00:28:21.760">...been filter to the time with whether...happened tells me there's an exception...well I didn't I didn't get any warning</p>
      <p begin="00:28:21.760" end="00:28:26.370">I didn't get a didn't seem to be any problem in the application if I click</p>
      <p begin="00:28:26.370" end="00:28:29.590">...debugging but I actually see is.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:30.610" end="00:28:34.150">When you try to insert to...with the same email address</p>
      <p begin="00:28:34.150" end="00:28:37.690">the intellectually fails but I never got any notification of the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:37.690" end="00:28:43.280">...so when somebody actually runs into this bag</p>
      <p begin="00:28:43.280" end="00:28:46.210">...going to tell me that when I try to enter</p>
      <p begin="00:28:46.210" end="00:28:52.640">to contact with the same email address have a problem we're going to tell me is...sometimes...them save?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:59.390">And, I'm going to...okay what's your...and other now sometimes we work sometimes it doesn't...just because it's a...</p>
      <p begin="00:28:59.390" end="00:29:04.560">exception and I have no...so when we have this type of problem there's two parts</p>
      <p begin="00:29:04.560" end="00:29:09.510">to the fix the first part is let's make sure the exception is throne for legitimate reasons</p>
      <p begin="00:29:09.510" end="00:29:14.130">like should they really be through an exception in this case maybe yes maybe not maybe I'll fix</p>
      <p begin="00:29:14.130" end="00:29:18.890">that the second part which is a little bit harder is figuring out why was</p>
      <p begin="00:29:18.890" end="00:29:25.490">this woman why didn't they get an error on my ui so if you have to solve this problem right</p>
      <p begin="00:29:25.490" end="00:29:28.870">now what would you do to find where this exception was</p>
      <p begin="00:29:28.870" end="00:29:34.630">...because there's no try cuts here.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:34.630" end="00:29:40.780">Look, at the construct the...like at the throw is going to say.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:40.780" end="00:29:53.890">I'm right there I'm talking about the cuts I'm talking about where was handled.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:53.890" end="00:29:58.790">Thank you...said what about the code events so the answer is I was saying basically to tell</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.790" end="00:30:01.910">I was trying to get to tell me have to look at the code</p>
      <p begin="00:30:01.910" end="00:30:04.840">...have to see what is calling this methods...any</p>
      <p begin="00:30:04.840" end="00:30:09.450">...cuts above it because if you put a break point at this point you only going to get the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:09.450" end="00:30:14.770">call stack up to now you know,...no way was handled right so if you go to intelligence</p>
      <p begin="00:30:14.770" end="00:30:19.230">mandel you click on the...event click</p>
      <p begin="00:30:19.230" end="00:30:23.430">...the historical debugging and it tells you that all the way up the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:23.430" end="00:30:26.370">...where we do the...catching</p>
      <p begin="00:30:26.370" end="00:30:31.230">exceptions because we think the only reason we will ever failed is because of concurrency but that's not true</p>
      <p begin="00:30:31.230" end="00:30:51.460">so this is how it can quickly get to what my event my exception handling is happening.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:51.460" end="00:30:54.740">Sure, absolutely, yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:54.740" end="00:30:59.550">So, the question was if I have a global exception hundred-and-something the global</p>
      <p begin="00:30:59.550" end="00:31:01.960">...x and that's where all my exceptions are being</p>
      <p begin="00:31:01.960" end="00:31:24.130">...and handled and logged will be able to use this for that and the answer is yes absolutely.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:24.130" end="00:31:28.990">So, the...so the comment was that visual studio actually has a pretty cool</p>
      <p begin="00:31:28.990" end="00:31:35.390">...functionality and also the right now if you go to debug.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:35.390" end="00:31:37.400">The but...settings.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:37.400" end="00:31:42.340">You're going to see a dialogue that we actually only recently revamped and twenty-fifth</p>
      <p begin="00:31:42.340" end="00:31:43.570">thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:43.570" end="00:31:47.910">And, it shows you all of the exceptions well it's a list of most of the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:47.910" end="00:31:52.600">most common exception types and where you can do is you can say for a particular exception or even for</p>
      <p begin="00:31:52.600" end="00:31:58.790">all of them I...visual studio to break as soon as it happens don't wait to see if it gets</p>
      <p begin="00:31:58.790" end="00:32:02.850">handle run handled...immediately now that's a great piece</p>
      <p begin="00:32:02.850" end="00:32:06.620">of functionality and it's very useful but it's kind of hard to work with</p>
      <p begin="00:32:06.620" end="00:32:10.380">...different scenarios one is you first have to kind of know that type of</p>
      <p begin="00:32:10.380" end="00:32:18.150">the exception so you have to...argument...exception or something like that and the other problem is even if,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:18.150" end="00:32:21.880">you know, the exception and you set it up if you application is throwing</p>
      <p begin="00:32:21.880" end="00:32:26.680">the type of exception in other places and it's old...you're going to keep eating those break</p>
      <p begin="00:32:26.680" end="00:32:31.710">...I don't care about those I want to get the one that is actually a problem so you might actually get this you keep</p>

      <p begin="00:32:33.270" end="00:32:35.710">With intelligible happen is you're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:32:35.710" end="00:32:46.840">...all of them and you can just go back and find the most appropriate one.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:46.840" end="00:32:55.090">Now they're moving on.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:55.090" end="00:33:00.820">So, let's talk about the few things that we've covered so far so those of you who have seen intelligence</p>
      <p begin="00:33:00.820" end="00:33:04.220">race and use...before you will have not this by now</p>
      <p begin="00:33:04.220" end="00:33:07.980">that the old ui is all gone used to be a</p>
      <p begin="00:33:07.980" end="00:33:11.570">...list on the right-hand side of solution...the same space</p>

      <p begin="00:33:15.720" end="00:33:20.710">...been integrated into diagnostics tools diagnostics tools is actually a new window into</p>
      <p begin="00:33:20.710" end="00:33:22.700">...fifteen and is the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:22.700" end="00:33:26.550">house for not session toiletries but also the cpu?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:26.550" end="00:33:29.560">And, the memory tool so-if you guys have a chance later</p>
      <p begin="00:33:29.560" end="00:33:34.250">on you should definitely look for the session that myself and untruthful</p>
      <p begin="00:33:34.250" end="00:33:39.910">gave yesterday that talks about the other tools are part of this window and you...also look out for the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:39.910" end="00:33:43.860">...course but explain how you can use diagnoses tool window keep</p>
      <p begin="00:33:43.860" end="00:33:48.360">...application not just as behaving in terms of correctness but also how</p>
      <p begin="00:33:48.360" end="00:33:51.070">...performing.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:51.070" end="00:33:55.100">Now we looked at how using intended trace</p>
      <p begin="00:33:55.100" end="00:33:59.370">...we accelerate your debugging experience basically you're going to spend less time</p>
      <p begin="00:33:59.370" end="00:34:03.920">looking for the bug you going to actually be able to find the bug quicker.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:03.920" end="00:34:08.890">And, we also that if you're just doing...normal debugging and just keeping an eye out for</p>
      <p begin="00:34:08.890" end="00:34:13.880">what is happening you can actually uncover unexpected behavior in this example it</p>
      <p begin="00:34:13.880" end="00:34:18.680">was...an exception was pretty easy to spot but you can uncover other behavior like, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:18.680" end="00:34:24.940">it may be executing too many...statements when...expected to we maybe accessing to...files.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:24.940" end="00:34:26.910">Now there's a whole bunch of stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:34:26.910" end="00:34:32.460">...can do that I don't have the time to them for you right now.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:32.460" end="00:34:37.350">But, I want to tell you about it so that if it sounds interesting to you can go and look it up we have blog posts and</p>
      <p begin="00:34:37.350" end="00:34:42.210">videos for all of this the first thing is you might be wondering how can I make use of</p>
      <p begin="00:34:42.210" end="00:34:47.099">intelligence if I can have visual studio the machine.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:47.099" end="00:34:51.919">Many times I have issues in production or testing environment that when I try to</p>
      <p begin="00:34:51.919" end="00:34:56.189">...local machine...as can get it to happen.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:56.189" end="00:34:58.599">So, the answer is but there's, there's,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:58.599" end="00:35:01.459">there's a way that you can record your applications execution</p>
      <p begin="00:35:01.459" end="00:35:05.889">using entirely trace even if you don't have visual...the record...machine.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:05.889" end="00:35:09.939">And, it's actually very simple you can just search online for the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:09.939" end="00:35:12.819">intelligently standalone collector is a download from</p>
      <p begin="00:35:12.819" end="00:35:17.459">microsoft-dot-com or you can go to the installation folder visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:35:17.459" end="00:35:22.319">and you will find a cub file that is the...standalone collective...file.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:22.319" end="00:35:27.830">You extract...zip file without any installation...server so you</p>
      <p begin="00:35:27.830" end="00:35:34.030">admins should be perfectly happy there's no installation you messing around with the service...and then you use our so the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:34.030" end="00:35:38.330">...it a please start monitoring this application pool if it's an</p>
      <p begin="00:35:38.330" end="00:35:41.010">expert on that website or...that monitoring</p>
      <p begin="00:35:41.010" end="00:35:45.680">for execute and monitor this application if it's an extra something like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:45.680" end="00:35:47.560">So, then the users can use the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:47.560" end="00:35:53.550">...production intelligence recording all those interesting events and when you have finally</p>
      <p begin="00:35:53.550" end="00:35:58.090">seeing the bug reproduce you can then use partial again to stop collection</p>
      <p begin="00:35:58.090" end="00:36:01.230">...collector is going to save all the data has collected</p>
      <p begin="00:36:02.290" end="00:36:14.250">...file so let me very quickly show you what looks like if I go back to my demo?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:14.250" end="00:36:18.340">because I have left over the debugging...just before what I can do is</p>
      <p begin="00:36:18.340" end="00:36:24.680">I can simulate the collector having done this for me but just going to tools.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:24.680" end="00:36:29.940">Debug...session this is going to save it</p>
      <p begin="00:36:29.940" end="00:36:33.450">...I...file if you notice the extension of the file here.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.450" end="00:36:38.060">This is exactly the same file format that my standalone collector would use if I was doing this</p>
      <p begin="00:36:38.060" end="00:36:42.060">...production...going to say this.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:42.060" end="00:36:46.910">...I stole debugging and when the standalone collector...production</p>
      <p begin="00:36:46.910" end="00:36:51.640">has save the file you copied back to develop a machine where you have visual studio and</p>
      <p begin="00:36:51.640" end="00:36:54.580">you just say file open file?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:55.600" end="00:36:56.980">Desktop.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:56.980" end="00:37:00.300">Find the answers...you could open.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:00.300" end="00:37:02.120">What happens is just like with</p>
      <p begin="00:37:02.120" end="00:37:07.300">dump debugging we'll show you a quick summary file?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:07.300" end="00:37:11.550">We give you some very quick and useful summary information what machine was using</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.550" end="00:37:16.490">...and exceptions being...you can click on any exception or any</p>
      <p begin="00:37:16.490" end="00:37:20.370">of information is useful and start debugging from there.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:20.370" end="00:37:22.520">So, at the back session is going to start and you</p>
      <p begin="00:37:22.520" end="00:37:26.350">...see the familiar you either you were you so before.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:26.350" end="00:37:30.960">Difference now is we don't have a timeline in this scenario so we'll have</p>
      <p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:35.160">...points and...have an out the window so we don't have time languages of the list.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:35.160" end="00:37:50.760">But, from here and then go in activities look at debugging just like I would before.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:50.760" end="00:37:55.160">Now if you think if you think...yourselves well this is really useful when I'm running a whole</p>
      <p begin="00:37:55.160" end="00:37:59.530">bunch of tests will be really helpful if when I run the test.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:59.530" end="00:38:03.010">And, there was an issue with us because it failed and,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:03.010" end="00:38:07.510">I want to...about the developer will be great if I could just give the developer nitrous file</p>
      <p begin="00:38:07.510" end="00:38:09.870">...so if that sounds like an</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09.870" end="00:38:13.490">...you interested in take a look at the integration of</p>
      <p begin="00:38:13.490" end="00:38:15.410">...with microsoft...manager.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:16.470" end="00:38:18.770">Imagine...used...manager to</p>
      <p begin="00:38:18.770" end="00:38:23.420">...your test you go through all your steps the test fails.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:23.420" end="00:38:27.200">When...dvs bug item is created the isis</p>
      <p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:31.640">files diplomatically attached to it and...assigned to the developer that little bit just</p>
      <p begin="00:38:31.640" end="00:38:38.990">...click on the access file and it's the same as opening the...follow the...genetical?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:38.990" end="00:38:43.150">Now...functionality...interesting these integration of</p>
      <p begin="00:38:43.150" end="00:38:45.890">...with the microsoft monitoring agent</p>
      <p begin="00:38:45.890" end="00:38:50.430">so imagine that you have your application running and you want...monitoring you want</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50.430" end="00:38:55.420">to see how it behaving without having specific issues and when something goes wrong?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:55.420" end="00:39:00.920">You get a nitrous file back you can open up in visual studio just like you did before.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:00.920" end="00:39:04.800">If that sounds interesting take a look at that integration or you can come</p>
      <p begin="00:39:04.800" end="00:39:24.660">...talking about the social can talk more about any questions so far yes, please.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:24.660" end="00:39:45.550">So, the question is...ahead.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:57.120" end="00:40:00.050">So,...actually three questions their.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:00.050" end="00:40:03.600">First question is do I need to start...race before</p>
      <p begin="00:40:03.600" end="00:40:08.380">...start my application to make sure...can collect from it what can I start my application and then</p>
      <p begin="00:40:08.380" end="00:40:13.300">later on-going attached to it and the answer is yes you can do both, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:13.300" end="00:40:17.410">if you have an application...running...production you don't have to stop it you</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.410" end="00:40:23.040">consist firepower and say start more than this application pool application is not going</p>
      <p begin="00:40:23.040" end="00:40:27.420">to stop working across for anybody and the same goes if you're using visual studio you can just a</p>
      <p begin="00:40:27.420" end="00:40:31.110">...process has already been studied.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:31.110" end="00:40:34.930">The second part of the question was is there an issue with the sizing is</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.930" end="00:40:39.250">...correctly so the second part of the question was if I have a</p>
      <p begin="00:40:39.250" end="00:40:45.300">system based generating a whole bunch of events what am I supposed to do...supposed to just</p>
      <p begin="00:40:45.300" end="00:40:50.540">let it run and fill...the hard disk other any issues or performance issues or other issues with illustrates</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.540" end="00:40:53.040">...the answer is?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:54.070" end="00:40:54.680">There's ways.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:55.870" end="00:40:59.000">There's ways to configuring...trace to work with the way you</p>
      <p begin="00:40:59.000" end="00:41:03.830">...application works and why can't I give you just a straight answer because it really depends what</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03.830" end="00:41:06.560">you code does right if you're code executes tentacle</p>
      <p begin="00:41:06.560" end="00:41:11.090">...a second...for an hour that's a lot of events comparing to and application</p>
      <p begin="00:41:11.090" end="00:41:14.870">that's us axes file of known then so it really depends on what</p>
      <p begin="00:41:14.870" end="00:41:18.900">...application does especially in comparison to how entirely</p>
      <p begin="00:41:18.900" end="00:41:23.530">...to what competitors...interesting so there's two ways you can</p>
      <p begin="00:41:23.530" end="00:41:28.400">calibrating...to make sure that you get the right experience and it doesn't, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:31.990">fill out the hard disk or kill the performance the first choice</p>
      <p begin="00:41:31.990" end="00:41:38.070">...you have is if you go to tools?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:38.070" end="00:41:42.340">...thank you.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:42.340" end="00:41:48.300">Tools options intelligence events this is the definite list of everything that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:48.300" end="00:41:52.090">intended...considers interesting and you'll notice that some of them</p>
      <p begin="00:41:52.090" end="00:41:55.040">...checked some of them are partially check...some of</p>
      <p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:41:58.080">them are completely unchecked so basically we've taken a stab</p>
      <p begin="00:41:58.080" end="00:42:02.900">...the most common stuff that people are interested in but if, you know,...application well,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:02.900" end="00:42:07.520">you know, exactly what you interested in you can customize this any way you want</p>
      <p begin="00:42:07.520" end="00:42:10.960">so if, you know,...application creates a whole bunch...a file</p>
      <p begin="00:42:10.960" end="00:42:16.780">...events but you never really have any issues without you can just unsettled...</p>
      <p begin="00:42:16.780" end="00:42:21.040">And, that means that even...the application...generating a whole ton of them they're not going to get</p>
      <p begin="00:42:21.040" end="00:42:27.160">...now the other way that you can optimize the experience is you</p>
      <p begin="00:42:27.160" end="00:42:33.720">can say how much this space...my isis file take up.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:33.720" end="00:42:38.160">This setting here in visual studio is for when you have five but the standalone</p>
      <p begin="00:42:38.160" end="00:42:42.380">collective has a similar feature where it allows you to say I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:42:42.380" end="00:42:46.490">file to never exceed let's say three hundred megabytes so-if</p>

      <p begin="00:42:49.390" end="00:42:54.150">exceed the limit is going to basically...a rolling buffer...going to go but the beginning and</p>
      <p begin="00:42:54.150" end="00:42:59.400">...writing over it so effectively what you have is the last number of</p>
      <p begin="00:42:59.400" end="00:43:03.720">events that happened so this way you can say don't capture absolutely everything</p>
      <p begin="00:43:03.720" end="00:43:08.900">discover the last big chunk of what has happened and I'm sorry but I forgot the last part</p>
      <p begin="00:43:08.900" end="00:43:11.840">...so you need</p>
      <p begin="00:43:11.840" end="00:43:15.710">...to actually get to the code when you're debugging.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:15.710" end="00:43:26.830">And, you should really always generate bb even with...slowed.</p>

      <p begin="00:44:26.100" end="00:44:30.990">aa have you guys seen the new way to edit...break points.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:30.990" end="00:44:35.050">You can either use these floating toolbar or you can rightly can say</p>
      <p begin="00:44:35.050" end="00:44:41.200">...and conditions so the cool thing is that even though this is functionality</p>
      <p begin="00:44:41.200" end="00:44:45.940">that was there before now it's much easier to discover you can create a break point</p>
      <p begin="00:44:45.940" end="00:44:49.300">...action output something to the output window and</p>
      <p begin="00:44:49.300" end="00:44:53.950">then continues execution so it doesn't actually break you will hit the line of code execute</p>
      <p begin="00:44:53.950" end="00:44:57.600">the map right the methods and keep going.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:57.600" end="00:45:07.890">I can write three types of messages here...rate normal text sorry...didn't do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:07.890" end="00:45:11.590">And, if I put the dollar sign down I did an entirely sense</p>
      <p begin="00:45:11.590" end="00:45:21.880">list of my pseudo variables are available so I can say this is my caller.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:21.880" end="00:45:23.010">And, then I can use</p>
      <p begin="00:45:23.010" end="00:45:27.610">...braces to access code...real variables so if I</p>
      <p begin="00:45:27.610" end="00:45:31.050">want to add some state doing calories that is not going to</p>
      <p begin="00:45:31.050" end="00:45:37.240">be captured automatically and create a little trace point I can say hey</p>
      <p begin="00:45:37.240" end="00:45:39.520">by give-me whatever is in construct.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:40.770" end="00:45:49.570">Say...is not-so-great don't get type, for example?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:49.570" end="00:45:54.540">And, it's not contact this contract.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:54.540" end="00:45:59.440">That's if I can get...to...to...tennis...works.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:01.960">So, now what's going to happen is if I closes and</p>
      <p begin="00:46:01.960" end="00:46:05.820">around this code if it hits through this line of code the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:05.820" end="00:46:10.260">...going to be output into the output window and if you remember what I said before</p>
      <p begin="00:46:10.260" end="00:46:14.530">intelligence records...the output window you're going to get a cute little purple</p>
      <p begin="00:46:14.530" end="00:46:19.020">icon on your timeline basically telling this is a custom thing that you added</p>
      <p begin="00:46:19.020" end="00:46:22.750">I'm collecting for-you and I didn't collective automatically.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:22.750" end="00:46:23.500">Yes, please.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:27.390" end="00:46:31.950">Well,...will this work for windows services the answer is yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:31.950" end="00:46:34.260">The short answer the longer actually</p>
      <p begin="00:46:34.260" end="00:46:39.740">...a bit tougher than just clicking so...to me right after...can guide you to a</p>
      <p begin="00:46:39.740" end="00:46:46.580">post explains how to do that but the short answer is yes you can use this on collector for when services.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:46.580" end="00:46:57.390">...was a...didn't have philosopher.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:57.390" end="00:47:09.480">The question is the used to be a limitation on the number of intelligence files.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:09.480" end="00:47:14.530">...that sounds like a bag to me I'm not aware of that limitation I would like to talk</p>
      <p begin="00:47:14.530" end="00:47:19.950">...afterwards if you don't mind to get the details those of a.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:19.950" end="00:47:25.820">Always...holds I...if it...point I'm sorry I didn't even know but...</p>
      <p begin="00:47:25.820" end="00:47:31.700">But, I'm glad you've been using...doesn't intend...get your contact those were the.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:31.700" end="00:47:38.720">Anybody else yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:38.720" end="00:47:46.350">Does all of this will work with remote debugged not right now?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:46.350" end="00:47:47.650">So, it's really hard to see the lights</p>
      <p begin="00:47:47.650" end="00:47:54.750">...coming and...performance it so that's a great question does having</p>
      <p begin="00:47:54.750" end="00:47:58.660">...intelligence enabled codes a performance hit the short answer</p>
      <p begin="00:47:58.660" end="00:48:03.660">is yes there is some debugging overhead because what intelligence is doing is it's recording</p>
      <p begin="00:48:03.660" end="00:48:07.790">...application is running so you have to take a little bit of time to do that now</p>
      <p begin="00:48:07.790" end="00:48:12.110">the more elaborate answers will how months so like I said before it really,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:12.110" end="00:48:16.690">really depends on what your application is doing if you application is generating events</p>
      <p begin="00:48:16.690" end="00:48:20.035">...betrays considers interesting all the time you're going</p>
      <p begin="00:48:20.035" end="00:48:24.930">to see a much larger overhead than when it is doing a lot less?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:24.930" end="00:48:26.820">Now as a rule of thumb with</p>
      <p begin="00:48:26.820" end="00:48:31.510">the default settings we think from our testing the overhead it's</p>
      <p begin="00:48:31.510" end="00:48:36.630">almost not receivable it's almost negligible the overhead gets larger</p>
      <p begin="00:48:36.630" end="00:48:43.460">the more working application is doing and the more events that you enable under tools options.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:43.460" end="00:48:45.290">...questions.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:45.290" end="00:49:00.370">Yes, hello.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:00.370" end="00:49:01.670">Can you have a trace...</p>
      <p begin="00:49:02.960" end="00:49:13.310">The answer is not right now but we're working on that.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:13.310" end="00:49:18.140">So, the question was how we made...improvements with instrumentation...how we made</p>
      <p begin="00:49:18.140" end="00:49:22.480">an improvement in the collection the short answer is yes we have made some improvements the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:22.480" end="00:49:24.740">more elaborate answer is in this release we</p>
      <p begin="00:49:24.740" end="00:49:29.640">focus mainly on the experience and integration so we didn't go back and</p>
      <p begin="00:49:29.640" end="00:49:33.980">...existing collection about we actually augmented the collection so as you</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.980" end="00:49:38.990">saw we collect output events we collect break points so we added collection</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38.990" end="00:49:42.680">...but...haven't contains existing ones.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:42.680" end="00:49:44.950">...questions.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:51.570" end="00:49:55.470">So, the question is there any tracing for windows that can be integrated within</p>
      <p begin="00:49:55.470" end="00:50:00.710">...like dw that's a great question and it has been requested</p>
      <p begin="00:50:00.710" end="00:50:05.550">by quite a few people were looking into it right now but it doesn't do it yet and actually</p>
      <p begin="00:50:05.550" end="00:50:08.840">will be very...to find out exactly how you like that</p>
      <p begin="00:50:08.840" end="00:50:17.710">the work exactly how you would imagine that the work so...have it said right after this.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:17.710" end="00:50:24.940">Okay, all right I don't think this and questions right uyvy let's move on.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:24.940" end="00:50:31.400">So, here's another people would kind of ignore this slide but here's a little sugar...many people.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:31.400" end="00:50:33.500">What...doing that?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:33.500" end="00:50:37.040">Thank you.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:37.040" end="00:50:42.230">here's something that many people know look at the very...appoint...talks about send using the</p>
      <p begin="00:50:42.230" end="00:50:46.910">send...functionality based on the top right corner visual studio if use</p>
      <p begin="00:50:46.910" end="00:50:51.010">the functionality and you send a smile and you put the right kind of keywords in their, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:51.010" end="00:50:56.560">if you say entirely trays did this that comes to me if you say the debugged this</p>
      <p begin="00:50:56.560" end="00:51:00.810">...the debugged pm so every single bit of feedback</p>
      <p begin="00:51:00.810" end="00:51:05.340">you give us either positive or negative gets read not by some random person by the</p>
      <p begin="00:51:05.340" end="00:51:08.260">...so...feedback is invaluable</p>
      <p begin="00:51:08.260" end="00:51:12.050">...know that when you see a bug you will probably reported and get...fixed but</p>
      <p begin="00:51:12.050" end="00:51:16.530">what's actually even more available for us is if we know what you guys enjoy using what</p>
      <p begin="00:51:16.530" end="00:51:21.670">...the ten features you actually enjoy like the three of the time that you like because when the</p>
      <p begin="00:51:21.670" end="00:51:26.010">next visual comes and we have to decide what so we keep what works great when</p>
      <p begin="00:51:26.010" end="00:51:30.050">it's improvement we need the data to make that decision.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:30.050" end="00:51:34.210">The other thing I wanted to know is that we definitely always take a look at</p>
      <p begin="00:51:34.210" end="00:51:37.910">user voice user voices a website where you can go and make a suggestion.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:38.970" end="00:51:41.860">And, people can vote for your position or you can vote for other people</p>
      <p begin="00:51:41.860" end="00:51:46.640">suggestion now you might be wondering whether that's going vote for everything you have limited votes so</p>
      <p begin="00:51:46.640" end="00:51:51.450">you have to actually care about what you're voting for and when the time comes for us to decide</p>
      <p begin="00:51:51.450" end="00:51:56.790">what we work on next we always look at that and if we're between two items?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:56.790" end="00:52:00.170">And, one of them has three thousand volts another...a hundred.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:00.170" end="00:52:05.520">...probably going to do the three thousand one so you feedback is invaluable and if you want</p>
      <p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:10.270">to keep up-to-date with anything that happens within the visual...diagnostic space</p>
      <p begin="00:52:10.270" end="00:52:14.500">we always, always, always blog about whether it's a simple feature improvement or</p>
      <p begin="00:52:14.500" end="00:52:19.090">brian you feature so if you go to our diagnostics login subscribe to that you</p>
      <p begin="00:52:19.090" end="00:52:24.370">will always be up-to-date with everything that comes out of the diagnostics depart.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:24.370" end="00:52:27.070">All right any questions now.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:27.070" end="00:52:37.640">No, one.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:37.640" end="00:52:42.860">So, the question is does this percentage...with application insights because application</p>
      <p begin="00:52:42.860" end="00:52:46.640">insights is a service that you can use that will monitor your application</p>
      <p begin="00:52:46.640" end="00:52:51.620">and then when something goes wrong you can take action the answer is we don't have a very good integration story right now but</p>
      <p begin="00:52:51.620" end="00:52:56.500">we're definitely looking...and if you don't mind talking to me afterwards to kind of help</p>
      <p begin="00:52:56.500" end="00:53:20.170">me understand how you would see that working the great?</p>
      <p begin="00:53:20.170" end="00:53:40.010">I'm not really sure I understood the question.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:40.010" end="00:53:43.850">So, I think the question is can you kind of when intended traces running</p>
      <p begin="00:53:43.850" end="00:53:48.070">...production...you keep the history of the files like this is what happened on monday this will</p>
      <p begin="00:53:48.070" end="00:53:52.020">...used in wednesday the answer is that there's no functionality to let you do that</p>
      <p begin="00:53:52.020" end="00:53:56.110">automatically right now because the only way you can actually generate the</p>
      <p begin="00:53:56.110" end="00:54:01.980">...file is if you stop collection so you start the collection...</p>
      <p begin="00:54:01.980" end="00:54:12.440">collecting and then when you stop you actually get the...now that's an interesting feature requests though so?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:12.440" end="00:54:15.720">No, the entire thing is not in memory.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:15.720" end="00:54:19.980">Correct so the question was while the what the</p>
      <p begin="00:54:19.980" end="00:54:23.930">...running is collecting data is everything be kept in memory and the answer is no it's not</p>
      <p begin="00:54:23.930" end="00:54:33.130">everything's been kept in memory we wouldn't do that because then that would affect the production system in terms of memory consumption?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:33.130" end="00:54:37.890">Absolutely you could scripted but if that's something that you guys think...valuable in useful load</p>
      <p begin="00:54:37.890" end="00:54:42.800">lovett if you come and talk to me and explained to me what kind of scenario you're talking about here why would that functionality be</p>
      <p begin="00:54:42.800" end="00:54:46.200">used for.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:46.200" end="00:54:50.080">...please.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:50.080" end="00:54:51.970">Connects been why...on the other person...here's</p>
      <p begin="00:54:51.970" end="00:54:57.690">another little secret that I hate answering questions var when this</p>
      <p begin="00:54:57.690" end="00:55:02.660">thing going to...tm because the answer I give makes me feel like I'm lying because I say I don't know now</p>
      <p begin="00:55:02.660" end="00:55:05.940">here's, here's the reality the product teams?</p>
      <p begin="00:55:05.940" end="00:55:09.640">Make no decisions when it comes to releases...</p>
      <p begin="00:55:09.640" end="00:55:13.660">So, the reason for that is because microsoft has many products and the kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:55:13.660" end="00:55:18.620">need to coordinate and...need to decide how they're going to sell and...going to sell and how it's going to coordinate with other</p>
      <p begin="00:55:18.620" end="00:55:21.720">releases so it's typically the marketing department makes kind</p>
      <p begin="00:55:21.720" end="00:55:27.120">of decisions so the honest answer is I don't know if you ask any pm</p>
      <p begin="00:55:27.120" end="00:55:33.160">at microsoft they would love to have their featuring community we would love to give it away for free would love for all</p>
      <p begin="00:55:33.160" end="00:55:38.540">...use it because that's our baby?</p>
      <p begin="00:55:38.540" end="00:55:41.160">But, if you've got the user voice and you say give</p>
      <p begin="00:55:41.160" end="00:55:49.060">me intellectually envious pro and five thousand people vote maybe can make happen.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:49.060" end="00:56:04.340">Times how many computers we have time something...when creates going to happen.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:04.340" end="00:56:12.580">So, what kind of application having in mind like...or?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:12.580" end="00:56:16.620">So, if you're in the f five scenario instead of visual studio...you using the</p>
      <p begin="00:56:16.620" end="00:56:19.490">...divider then intelligence</p>
      <p begin="00:56:19.490" end="00:56:31.000">will work for that part it's not going to be able to record anything...cplus-plus unfortunately.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:31.000" end="00:56:32.330">All right.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:32.330" end="00:56:40.900">Well, thank you all very much for your time.</p>
