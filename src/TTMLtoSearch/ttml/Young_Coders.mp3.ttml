      <p begin="00:00:13.400" end="00:00:18.580">...sitting computer science...of health nice and what about you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.580" end="00:00:23.080">...and I'm in my second-year secondary school that's what's so,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.080" end="00:00:27.620">is that I for us and be like tenth grade right in the united states so,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.620" end="00:00:32.610">here's a question how did you guys get...I for</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.610" end="00:00:37.350">media was playing on the internet back in the nineties what was it that inspired you to start</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.350" end="00:00:40.280">cody both of</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.280" end="00:00:44.400">our father lex in the industry already zip from a very young age</p>
      <p begin="00:00:44.400" end="00:00:49.110">...surrounded by computers and programming and when we were really</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.110" end="00:00:55.200">...so we had was like mine...school...dtwo?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.200" end="00:00:58.510">And, program to run around and you guys are my</p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.510" end="00:01:05.100">...love this and how about you what got you interested in might bite...from...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.100" end="00:01:09.950">into programming just because I've always been exposed to it and?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:09.950" end="00:01:15.000">If at school...and I've notice whenever I go to cope clubs I've always been</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:19.780">...to say code clubs there's such a thing in england what are those</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.780" end="00:01:20.910">light.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:20.910" end="00:01:23.880">And, the...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.880" end="00:01:27.930">As states and...normally in primary school they were</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.930" end="00:01:30.610">that get children...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.610" end="00:01:35.650">programming and it secondary school they're doing...information it feels like a code</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.650" end="00:01:42.300">...somewhere I'd like to go so here's, here's a question what kind of apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.300" end="00:01:46.350">We've made...cookbook...we use</p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.350" end="00:01:51.150">and it was originally civic just have ago...windows a...we</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.150" end="00:01:56.000">migrated it to universal up so...run on the phone and...to</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:02:00.710">...ten soon so people...I still have to learn how to do this</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.710" end="00:02:04.440">...so maybe you could help me but that's remarkable example</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.440" end="00:02:09.630">...csharp is hard and it's wonderful that you guys were able to what about you are you doing the same kind of abs</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.630" end="00:02:14.250">...together or you have your own we might...together but we also have</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.250" end="00:02:17.970">...the app called and...and crosses program.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:17.970" end="00:02:21.000">Wants to have a good writing a computer so</p>
      <p begin="00:02:21.000" end="00:02:24.910">...soon ai who can play the game against.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:24.910" end="00:02:29.300">I feel dom might be with you guys this is remarkable so here's another question what</p>
      <p begin="00:02:29.300" end="00:02:36.030">are the challenges that you experience while writing these.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.030" end="00:02:39.000">We always find it...to get going</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.000" end="00:02:45.160">when writing programs we find that will get...do not some crosses...saracsit</p>
      <p begin="00:02:45.160" end="00:02:50.340">...good maybe even a month very what do we do...and it'll certainly be we do that and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:50.340" end="00:02:56.140">then falls out and within a week...I love...as a majority of computer</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.140" end="00:03:00.660">science is...and what you saw it through typing is really fast right, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:00.660" end="00:03:05.640">what about you what challenges if you experience...outside the challenges of actually having</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.640" end="00:03:09.600">time to do it being I have lots of homewood right?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.600" end="00:03:12.820">Now...school diverse</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.820" end="00:03:17.910">...homework I spend most of my time hysteria theater and figuring.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:17.910" end="00:03:25.120">Your haired built what are some of the cool things you...it...that you like.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:30.030">You have to say the whole...you get to see the howard's I gutsy</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.030" end="00:03:35.840">attend the presentation so I got to see in use...room and how is</p>
      <p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:40.300">...and how they could paths...models through?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:40.300" end="00:03:42.180">Three...and then shared</p>
      <p begin="00:03:42.180" end="00:03:46.840">...putting an actual...model on the table right...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.840" end="00:03:52.240">then scaling down and moving around an actual living room and that's really cool because,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52.240" end="00:03:55.370">you know, since you've already built...universal windows app</p>
      <p begin="00:03:55.370" end="00:03:59.100">...you will...better at making poland's applications and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:59.100" end="00:04:04.060">...I haven't done that what about you build watered...you see I like they've really</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.060" end="00:04:09.940">...resource platform visual studio...your own...clyde...by...craft</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.940" end="00:04:15.410">...I would be look it'd be great to actually else...aren't that's</p>
      <p begin="00:04:15.410" end="00:04:20.720">...look I did not do...about might craft until my boss is like keiko look at might</p>
      <p begin="00:04:20.720" end="00:04:25.700">...is like legos on steroids I did not have that when I was a kid it's a</p>
      <p begin="00:04:25.700" end="00:04:29.040">...it's cooler now we can write some code to do our own</p>
      <p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:34.290">...ok so here's another question of on the serious what can we do as a</p>
      <p begin="00:04:34.290" end="00:04:39.580">community of developers to encourage young people to go into program</p>
      <p begin="00:04:39.580" end="00:04:43.040">...you...tufts when...like ensues...code</p>
      <p begin="00:04:43.040" end="00:04:46.710">...all as I seen it...it's very similar scraps but it's</p>
      <p begin="00:04:46.710" end="00:04:52.210">...learn easy-to-use and it comes with its own guides?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:52.210" end="00:04:57.020">you could give...to resources to teachers...athlete they seem to be the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:57.020" end="00:05:01.610">bits...teach it...to have...than...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:01.610" end="00:05:06.540">They'll probably find a lot easier to teach...advice what you</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.540" end="00:05:11.030">...at the moment...the uk and...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.030" end="00:05:15.880">they teach students icy...which is it's usually...to use words that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.880" end="00:05:21.080">must be office park how to work...and...interface but this...to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.080" end="00:05:26.370">...that completely with computing which is just teaching...code</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.370" end="00:05:31.330">...out so I think it's gcc the very keen on students fields</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31.330" end="00:05:37.140">programming at least three languages all...thing and that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:37.140" end="00:05:41.280">is very keen on getting out the...introducing and making</p>
      <p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:45.410">...curriculum...like my two-year-old like I</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.410" end="00:05:50.750">sort of like we gave them a little a little lap of what those types devices</p>
      <p begin="00:05:50.750" end="00:05:56.010">...start swiping around and doing stuff already feels like teaching young people to use</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56.010" end="00:06:01.470">words they already know-how why not start with...ask another question.</p>
