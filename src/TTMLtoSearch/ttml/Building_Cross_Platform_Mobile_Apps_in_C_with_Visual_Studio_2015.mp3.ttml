      <p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:20.040">In the meantime maybe I can ask you guys like how you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.040" end="00:00:23.500">...are doing a enjoying bill so far.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.500" end="00:00:25.660">You guys check out...check out the whole length</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.660" end="00:00:32.190">...and the stuff poland's can do nobody.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.190" end="00:00:37.200">I think it's here somewhere we're not allowed to go-there actually it's only for customers.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:50.920">I mean I would love to play my...it but I just have analysis.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.920" end="00:00:57.700">Yes, I mean I don't havethat doesn't mean like I mean I'm sure like there must be like</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.700" end="00:01:15.890">know very little about it was like a very hush-hushproject but it looks pretty cool.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.890" end="00:01:18.980">So, this is a quick server you're like how many people actually today</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.980" end="00:01:22.200">...stuff using cplus-plus you guys all</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.200" end="00:01:24.920">...cplus-plus users perfect.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.950" end="00:01:32.360">That's a good crash and how many of you guys are actually milling mobile apps?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.360" end="00:01:36.300">How many of you guys...for platforms...windows?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:36.300" end="00:01:40.460">...perfect so if that is the case you guys have come to</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.460" end="00:01:49.700">the right talk thank you for choosing us over some of the other...available at this time.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.700" end="00:02:16.820">...one-minute...I can actually officially start.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.820" end="00:02:29.640">Yes, everybody come here perfect more people coming in great.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:29.640" end="00:02:30.110">...can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:02:30.110" end="00:02:41.240">start so if you guys can settle...I'm actually going to get started here.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.240" end="00:02:42.680">So, this talk is going to be about</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.680" end="00:02:48.050">...building cross-platform mobile apps using cplus-plus this is something new that we've</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.050" end="00:02:52.450">...twenty fifteen to introduce myself and I</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.450" end="00:02:58.300">...a I am a program manager I work in the visual...team.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.300" end="00:03:01.160">And, this session essentially is going to be a bunch of</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.160" end="00:03:05.970">...like for a few slides essentially just give you guys an overview of...you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.970" end="00:03:09.110">mobile platform technologies look lag where some</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.110" end="00:03:13.740">of the strategies and then we'll get into some doing some cool demos so I want</p>
      <p begin="00:03:13.740" end="00:03:17.420">to session to be interactive so essentially please participate when</p>
      <p begin="00:03:17.420" end="00:03:23.530">ask us questions because ...sessions is not only giving information to you guys</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23.530" end="00:03:30.800">there's also getting information back for us so we can build a...for us.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.800" end="00:03:34.640">So, evaluation yes so please said do</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.640" end="00:03:39.000">...evaluations here for each...session their important in-house the speakers</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.000" end="00:03:44.490">like myself improve and also helps us if...actually presented...content that's useful for</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.490" end="00:03:49.320">you guys as you go through the sessions so please take time to do that and the of</p>
      <p begin="00:03:49.320" end="00:03:55.830">the session hopefully good and, with that I'll get started the first slide here so the first slide</p>
      <p begin="00:03:55.830" end="00:04:00.150">here's about more platforms more opportunities...so if you take a look at</p>
      <p begin="00:04:00.150" end="00:04:05.490">the current mobile user which I'm sure all you guys are we all have our favorite</p>
      <p begin="00:04:05.490" end="00:04:09.370">set of applications and we want to be able to use them across a</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.370" end="00:04:13.550">wiesel devices I might have an android phone at work but I might have</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.550" end="00:04:18.950">...at home and I will be able to use the same app across these two platforms as</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.950" end="00:04:23.380">a result developers is you guys going to be able to target</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.380" end="00:04:27.240">mode platform because targeting...platforms for you guys means more</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.240" end="00:04:32.930">money or opportunity for someone like me if I'm...more...good famous.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:32.930" end="00:04:37.930">So, if you go ahead and you want to designer application mobile application there's multiple ways you can</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.930" end="00:04:41.570">go about this the first approach you guys can take is essentially the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.570" end="00:04:44.790">...approach which is basically you can go ahead go ahead and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:44.790" end="00:04:49.520">build the application on each platform in the popular language on the platform that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.520" end="00:04:56.270">would be like csharp on windows...see and...swifton ios.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.270" end="00:04:59.020">Android and java.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.020" end="00:05:01.460">So, on so obviously a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:01.460" end="00:05:06.100">...rhythms matter and there's benefits...approach now if...using this kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.100" end="00:05:10.950">an approach where you guys can do is that you guys have the full native experience</p>
      <p begin="00:05:10.950" end="00:05:15.640">you guys have access to the platform sdk which allows you to access all platform api</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.640" end="00:05:21.190">...an leverage the full feature compatibility on...platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.190" end="00:05:25.580">...are also some negatives...this kind of an approach...you guys now that I server the start</p>
      <p begin="00:05:25.580" end="00:05:29.670">...guys are cplus-plus users in fact how many people actually think that there</p>
      <p begin="00:05:29.670" end="00:05:36.030">...some of the negatives you guys can think of...anybody in the room.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:36.030" end="00:05:42.550">So, again, compiler compilers...compatible interesting and the of sir.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:42.550" end="00:05:45.690">Bingo that's correct...correct you have to writer</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.690" end="00:05:50.190">...three times so the negatives here the first from being there is minimal call reuse</p>
      <p begin="00:05:50.190" end="00:05:55.170">now imagine I'm actually creating a new feature on my application that's being targeting all</p>
      <p begin="00:05:55.170" end="00:06:00.040">these platforms after...three times as...and cplus-plus or cx in windows</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.040" end="00:06:06.010">...sharpen windows when objective cfour ios java for android so on.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:06.010" end="00:06:09.260">So, that's not good.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.260" end="00:06:13.980">As result your no-win customer or...increases so on right so let's</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.980" end="00:06:18.940">...another trivia question here the question is for you guys again how many of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.940" end="00:06:29.690">the top fifty applications in the android place for us leverage cc pascal.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:29.690" end="00:06:35.080">So, the first choices men and people actually think that in the top fifty application the and replaced</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.080" end="00:06:39.140">...now them actually using cplus-plus.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:39.140" end="00:06:43.330">Okay, how many people think that there's ten percent of the applications on the and replaced</p>
      <p begin="00:06:43.330" end="00:06:44.180">...using cplus-plus?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:46.920" end="00:06:52.290">Our people...forty percent applications that are using super-fast in the top fifty.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:52.290" end="00:06:56.890">And, who's going...the brave one here and say that eighty percent of the applications on the and replace</p>
      <p begin="00:06:56.890" end="00:07:01.530">...using cplus-plus how we have a smart bunch here.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.530" end="00:07:02.350">So, the reason</p>
      <p begin="00:07:02.350" end="00:07:07.080">...slide was because the answer is obviously eighty percent surprising how many people</p>
      <p begin="00:07:07.080" end="00:07:10.870">find surprising that eighty percent of the and replace laptop application...and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.870" end="00:07:14.660">...fifty or using cplus-plus well let's take a look at</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.660" end="00:07:20.780">these applications are so again this data is a...couple of weeks-old so don't</p>
      <p begin="00:07:20.780" end="00:07:24.230">assuming if any of the order changed here so,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.230" end="00:07:28.070">the platform defining apps like facebook.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:28.070" end="00:07:30.770">Candy crush there's a couple of candy...folks</p>
      <p begin="00:07:30.770" end="00:07:36.680">...the...said known the mention them but I'm going to mention anyways ...</p>
      <p begin="00:07:36.680" end="00:07:42.330">another microsoft application temple run twitter</p>
      <p begin="00:07:42.330" end="00:07:46.560">all these famous platform defining applications are currently using cplus-plus.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:49.940">Now a lot now if you talk about, you know, in what quantity</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.940" end="00:07:54.270">their leveraging cplus-plus that's actually difference if you talk about an application like</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.270" end="00:07:59.970">scribe which is basically truly cross-platform mobile which targets android ios and,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:59.970" end="00:08:04.870">windows they have about seventy to eighty percent of their code...in cplus-plus the same</p>
      <p begin="00:08:04.870" end="00:08:10.090">is the case of office so the other apps like facebook might be using only</p>
      <p begin="00:08:10.090" end="00:08:14.890">a small library or small portion of their functionality better leather leveraging</p>
      <p begin="00:08:14.890" end="00:08:18.380">...using cplus-plus so the mileage varies...thing</p>
      <p begin="00:08:18.380" end="00:08:24.830">that's for sure all this stuff fifty apps...something in common among them...using cplus-plus.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:24.830" end="00:08:28.590">Now cplus-plus from a language perspective is supporter</p>
      <p begin="00:08:28.590" end="00:08:33.400">all these platforms and if I actually go ahead and write my cross-platform</p>
      <p begin="00:08:33.400" end="00:08:38.330">code let's say my business other government application in cplus-plus and actually have a</p>
      <p begin="00:08:38.330" end="00:08:42.980">lightweight ui on top of that in the platform language then I can still actually get the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:42.980" end="00:08:48.350">benefits that I want from a perspective a fully of experience I get the platform sdk</p>
      <p begin="00:08:48.350" end="00:08:51.240">...access to it so I can actually access any of the api</p>
      <p begin="00:08:51.240" end="00:08:56.640">is but there's also some other advantages the obvious one is we use.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:08:57.070">Worse on</p>
      <p begin="00:08:57.070" end="00:09:03.620">the other advantages you guys can think of maybe some from that side of the room is time.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:03.620" end="00:09:07.670">...speed absolutely performance the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:07.670" end="00:09:10.170">age-old argument of using cplus-plus over</p>
      <p begin="00:09:10.170" end="00:09:14.980">languages is performance and that is absolutely correct cc</p>
      <p begin="00:09:14.980" end="00:09:19.930">...code runs directly on the hardware as compared to traditional dot net or java</p>
      <p begin="00:09:19.930" end="00:09:24.070">code also if you want to access the advance</p>
      <p begin="00:09:24.070" end="00:09:28.220">...instructions or neon instructions on your great a...galaxy</p>
      <p begin="00:09:28.220" end="00:09:33.210">as five device I guess what do you using cplus-plus if you want to have food animations</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.210" end="00:09:36.330">in your games...using cplus-plus.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.540" end="00:09:40.450">Also if you take a look around most of the mobile platforms today</p>
      <p begin="00:09:40.450" end="00:09:45.380">...arm chips arm is great for battery life but it's not-so-great when</p>
      <p begin="00:09:45.380" end="00:09:50.450">compared to some of the into counterparts maybe for runtime performance maybe again</p>
      <p begin="00:09:50.450" end="00:09:54.510">and over there if using seep...every allen's performance they again from</p>
      <p begin="00:09:54.510" end="00:09:59.050">...on those to mobile devices is worth its weight in pounds and that is</p>
      <p begin="00:09:59.050" end="00:10:03.170">exactly so the reasons why those apps that I mention there are using</p>
      <p begin="00:10:05.200" end="00:10:10.220">...move on here these slides will be available for people just people thing pictures</p>
      <p begin="00:10:10.220" end="00:10:15.360">so...actually...we've seen like, you know, what kind of apps using cplus-plus so on</p>
      <p begin="00:10:15.360" end="00:10:20.110">let's look at how does the architecture look like so apps like office</p>
      <p begin="00:10:20.110" end="00:10:23.740">scribe bing maps drop box?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:23.740" end="00:10:25.820">I mean there's a great talk by drop box and using</p>
      <p begin="00:10:25.820" end="00:10:31.750">...cross-platform retrace you look for it is hyperlink in the presentations well all these apps</p>
      <p begin="00:10:31.750" end="00:10:35.620">are there have a very...layer of their code...cross-platform</p>
      <p begin="00:10:35.620" end="00:10:39.170">...cplus-plus office...ninety percent of their code and cplus-plus.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:40.190" end="00:10:44.400">And, then you basically go ahead and write your ui or</p>
      <p begin="00:10:44.400" end="00:10:49.250">...layer...software in the lightweight language it could be xml java in case of android</p>
      <p begin="00:10:49.250" end="00:10:52.680">...axis axes it using jan I, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:52.680" end="00:10:58.030">which is a job...interface into your...layer and the same you can do for windows using</p>
      <p begin="00:10:58.030" end="00:11:01.840">p invoke or...objective see wrapper so on so this is a</p>
      <p begin="00:11:01.840" end="00:11:04.650">...approach but it has challenges?</p>
      <p begin="00:11:05.920" end="00:11:08.710">Now if I actually using.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:08.710" end="00:11:13.660">If you're actually using cplus-plus across these different platform their challenges so far we've seen that,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:13.660" end="00:11:17.110">you know, it's actually good I can actually, you know, right my cross-platform</p>
      <p begin="00:11:17.110" end="00:11:21.250">conan cplus-plus and the ability to do that every platform you</p>
      <p begin="00:11:21.250" end="00:11:25.430">...architecture now we talking about some of the challenges are there when you're trying to use cplus-plus</p>
      <p begin="00:11:26.830" end="00:11:30.180">there is a variety of compilers someone earlier mention compilers</p>
      <p begin="00:11:30.180" end="00:11:34.810">here you see a variety of comparison using platforms right there's a visual see</p>
      <p begin="00:11:34.810" end="00:11:40.730">...for the windows platform is...and dc from the...there's triangle</p>
      <p begin="00:11:40.730" end="00:11:45.980">...is the apples version of triangle vm there's different building...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:45.980" end="00:11:51.060">There's different id easter's visual studio for windows...eclipse today...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:51.060" end="00:11:58.560">development android needed development and which studio for java so on and there's...obviously for mac?</p>
      <p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:03.010">Which brings us to this slide which talks about some of the challenges that we have,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:03.010" end="00:12:05.250">you know,...summarizes...the challenges...have</p>
      <p begin="00:12:05.250" end="00:12:08.460">...cplus-plus now you guys in the room people using</p>
      <p begin="00:12:08.460" end="00:12:11.590">cplus-plus I'm show you guys can locate yourself either</p>
      <p begin="00:12:11.590" end="00:12:17.430">in a column or row and column so on so, the challenges</p>
      <p begin="00:12:17.430" end="00:12:21.940">here all these tools installing them there's different acquisition experiences,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:21.940" end="00:12:26.520">you know, you have to go figure out how to install if we talk about the and platform you got install</p>
      <p begin="00:12:26.520" end="00:12:31.400">android and dk the sdk and java set of the right plug...clip so</p>
      <p begin="00:12:31.400" end="00:12:36.220">you can debug the code so on there's chat there's definitely problems there...having multiple</p>
      <p begin="00:12:36.220" end="00:12:41.390">installation experiences if that's not enough you guys have to go ahead and figure out how</p>
      <p begin="00:12:41.390" end="00:12:43.080">these multiple tools?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:43.080" end="00:12:48.110">You know, the flags between clang ans and the visual studio compiler the microsoft compiler</p>
      <p begin="00:12:48.110" end="00:12:54.320">different there's compatibility issues the way the pcs works is different so on and of course there's</p>
      <p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:12:57.630">from both systems I mean, you know, as we learning about x code build</p>
      <p begin="00:12:57.630" end="00:13:02.660">...is bill...to be honest yielding common them's...</p>
      <p begin="00:13:02.660" end="00:13:04.220">So,...actually different</p>
      <p begin="00:13:04.220" end="00:13:09.020">...system that you guys have to use today to debugging so one of the primary reasons you</p>
      <p begin="00:13:09.020" end="00:13:14.760">know, you'll see like for experience...next slide is that debugging experience specially for the and</p>
      <p begin="00:13:14.760" end="00:13:20.230">platforms not accurate especially the android...debugging experience those of you guys here in the room</p>
      <p begin="00:13:20.230" end="00:13:23.680">...actually develop an application for android which uses cplus-plus how...people find</p>
      <p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:30.210">...debugging spurs numbing ideal what is actually a few people here people over there</p>
      <p begin="00:13:30.210" end="00:13:35.800">every glasses...really see that far but I saw some answer.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:35.800" end="00:13:40.750">Also another thing here multiple see...there's x code for ios there's</p>
      <p begin="00:13:40.750" end="00:13:45.850">and there's android studio an eclipse for android...studio for windows</p>
      <p begin="00:13:45.850" end="00:13:50.350">...you guys are used to trying out your favorite key bindings and shortcuts so</p>
      <p begin="00:13:50.350" end="00:13:51.920">on the lighten level</p>
      <p begin="00:13:51.920" end="00:13:57.290">...id that's actually hard to keep changing eighties so on.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:57.290" end="00:13:59.530">So, with that said.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:59.530" end="00:14:03.820">Starting with visual...twenty fifteen rc we want to share some</p>
      <p begin="00:14:03.820" end="00:14:09.060">...guys right this is really exciting time for us from visual studio team we</p>
      <p begin="00:14:09.060" end="00:14:13.570">Network ons animation last night starting...visual studio twelve-fifty rc</p>
      <p begin="00:14:13.570" end="00:14:15.460">...start seeing.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:15.460" end="00:14:21.810">The experience that we're trying to provide for cross-platform see buffers developers such as yourself here.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:21.810" end="00:14:26.020">Using this experience you'll be able to easily install oggenc cross-platform</p>
      <p begin="00:14:26.020" end="00:14:31.000">needs this means that you can actually install your first party microsoft software, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:31.000" end="00:14:32.690">the templates in the project in both system</p>
      <p begin="00:14:32.690" end="00:14:37.400">that's so on you can also install your third-party suffer which includes you android</p>
      <p begin="00:14:37.400" end="00:14:42.460">...android sdk and java so on not only that you can also</p>
      <p begin="00:14:42.460" end="00:14:47.440">manage dependencies and, be able you'll be notified in notification managing set of bs</p>
      <p begin="00:14:47.440" end="00:14:54.590">has new versions of them become available and you can absolutely update your bits as the need b.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:54.590" end="00:14:58.030">There will be one single cplus-plus id evil offering that one-c</p>
      <p begin="00:14:58.030" end="00:15:02.810">...id for all your cross-platform needs to currently we're focusing on that fat cplus-plus</p>
      <p begin="00:15:02.810" end="00:15:07.360">...of software and we believe...twenty fifteen rc.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:11.620">The idea of choice will programs for the one that...can offer.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:11.620" end="00:15:15.960">We're also going to offer...this is will show you some really cool features</p>
      <p begin="00:15:15.960" end="00:15:18.100">...cross-platform space which allow you to</p>
      <p begin="00:15:18.100" end="00:15:21.090">...reuse your cross-platform code.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:21.090" end="00:15:21.980">And, also allow us</p>
      <p begin="00:15:21.980" end="00:15:26.650">allow you guys to user state of the art coding features so the advance features encoding,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:26.650" end="00:15:30.770">for example, refactoring and cross-platform intelligence it doesn't</p>
      <p begin="00:15:30.770" end="00:15:34.450">end there will also take the same experience you guys are used today on the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:34.450" end="00:15:39.210">windows platform and extend that from the anger platform working at bing maps and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:39.210" end="00:15:43.770">office and internal partners over a period of time we believe we have the fastest android</p>
      <p begin="00:15:43.770" end="00:15:47.380">...other today on the platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:47.380" end="00:15:50.620">And, to top this all...we essentially, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:50.620" end="00:15:54.720">really believe in you guys having a very fast...and debug cycle so for the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:54.720" end="00:15:58.550">error platform specifically we're also...the microsoft x eighty-six</p>
      <p begin="00:15:58.550" end="00:16:01.860">...emulator...based on library it's fast.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:01.860" end="00:16:05.540">It's super cool so all this is available now envisions</p>
      <p begin="00:16:05.540" end="00:16:10.590">...twenty-fifth in rc it will also be available community addition.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:10.590" end="00:16:14.800">At this point I would actually look for any questions you guys might...so far before actually</p>
      <p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:20.410">going to demos does anybody have any questions so far.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:20.410" end="00:16:26.420">You...all happy excited question sir yes sir.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:26.420" end="00:16:31.230">How far...a...the ask experience I will answer that question in the last fifteen minutes of the presentation</p>
      <p begin="00:16:31.230" end="00:16:36.880">...that's okay sir?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:36.880" end="00:16:40.030">...to install on the mac on the linux system I will also see</p>
      <p begin="00:16:40.030" end="00:16:47.590">also see that shortly domain ...me one that might be a better idea.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:47.590" end="00:16:52.280">...that's actually go...the first...of the day so who here was actually the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:52.280" end="00:16:56.520">...as well for cross-platform a few folks here.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:56.520" end="00:16:59.500">So, she demo this app and we're going to actually talk about how we create this</p>
      <p begin="00:16:59.500" end="00:17:04.050">happen so on so the apple going to show you guys's the monty potts native activity and</p>
      <p begin="00:17:04.050" end="00:17:09.080">...application is coming from the android...kit and native activity for you guys</p>
      <p begin="00:17:09.080" end="00:17:12.780">...not very familiar with...platform is a style of...programming</p>
      <p begin="00:17:12.780" end="00:17:17.400">majority and almost all your coda cplus-plus you still have a very ten java</p>
      <p begin="00:17:17.400" end="00:17:21.560">...top but that's really for show.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:21.560" end="00:17:22.950">So, we're going to go demo that's</p>
      <p begin="00:17:22.950" end="00:17:29.270">a for doing that I'm actually going to move back here and wake-up my machines here.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:29.270" end="00:17:32.850">And, also change my.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:32.850" end="00:17:39.600">Display poured here.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:39.600" end="00:17:41.490">All right so.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:41.490" end="00:17:45.560">If you guys want to try this out at home or if you guys really have is two-twenty fifteen</p>
      <p begin="00:17:45.560" end="00:17:51.050">rc this is actually a sample so you can go here</p>
      <p begin="00:17:51.050" end="00:17:54.700">you can see here that I already install this you guys can install</p>
      <p begin="00:17:54.700" end="00:17:57.530">...well and try it out yourself.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:57.530" end="00:18:01.880">It's pretty easy so that's...let's take a look at this project</p>
      <p begin="00:18:01.880" end="00:18:05.750">right so here is the more teapot android project.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:06.770" end="00:18:11.810">This has to projects within that there is a native activity project</p>
      <p begin="00:18:11.810" end="00:18:14.080">...that for you guys.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:17.780">And, then there is the packaging project.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:17.780" end="00:18:22.600">The needed activity project here contains all the cc...code that you have for</p>
      <p begin="00:18:22.600" end="00:18:26.880">...application and if I take a look at property pages you'll</p>
      <p begin="00:18:26.880" end="00:18:31.590">notice that this is building a dynamic shared library for those of you guys are not very familiar with the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:31.590" end="00:18:36.410">...reprogramming again this is...the building...the windows platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:36.410" end="00:18:41.160">Using probably pages you guys can also...modify some other project characteristics,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:41.160" end="00:18:45.110">for example, I can go ahead and choose the platform tool set</p>
      <p begin="00:18:45.110" end="00:18:48.580">I want to choose we currently support both clang and</p>
      <p begin="00:18:48.580" end="00:18:54.420">...and this is coming from the android...</p>
      <p begin="00:18:55.580" end="00:18:58.790">You can actually go ahead and choosy target api level you want to use</p>
      <p begin="00:18:58.790" end="00:19:03.670">for an application we support up to a parallel twenty-one currently working fast</p>
      <p begin="00:19:03.670" end="00:19:08.880">on updating these...well on the latest api level.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:08.880" end="00:19:12.430">All the other property pages...also been migrated to work with</p>
      <p begin="00:19:12.430" end="00:19:14.280">...and dc so</p>
      <p begin="00:19:14.280" end="00:19:18.240">...something new in our tilting remember the native actively</p>
      <p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:22.640">projects building that c cplus-plus library that cc buffers libraries then</p>
      <p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:27.590">getting used up in the packaging project which invokes the and...system.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:27.590" end="00:19:33.370">And, takes that cplus-plus library and gives you an android into an application or</p>
      <p begin="00:19:33.370" end="00:19:37.760">...pk file which you can then debug...</p>
      <p begin="00:19:37.760" end="00:19:42.240">So, next I want to show you guys of the features that we have from according perspectives let's jump into</p>
      <p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:47.180">some code here so I'm going to look for this function call android main.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:47.180" end="00:19:52.210">Which is in the more teapot native activity dot...source file?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:52.210" end="00:19:54.020">Now android main is</p>
      <p begin="00:19:54.020" end="00:19:58.290">...native activity function it's almost like an entry point function is</p>
      <p begin="00:19:58.290" end="00:20:05.950">very similar to an into main function in windows thirty-two console application.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:05.950" end="00:20:10.440">I'm actually going to go ahead and add a log message here.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:10.440" end="00:20:14.200">Very similar to the one above.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:14.200" end="00:20:16.960">Notice as I'm doing this the android specific</p>
      <p begin="00:20:16.960" end="00:20:22.910">intel's is lighting up and helping me out here.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:22.910" end="00:20:30.640">So, I'm going to say this is during the live demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:30.640" end="00:20:32.600">So, we've actually done work to enable</p>
      <p begin="00:20:32.600" end="00:20:37.330">...specific analysis which lets you not only view the api the you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:20:37.330" end="00:20:42.250">use but also the type information and all that kind of other information...this from</p>
      <p begin="00:20:42.250" end="00:20:43.460">...windows platform respective.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:44.540" end="00:20:49.010">All the other features...you guys are used to, for example.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:49.010" end="00:20:53.810">If I want to go ahead and look at the definition let's say for id I can use the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:53.810" end="00:20:57.820">...definition window to be able to do this nicely so I can see</p>
      <p begin="00:20:57.820" end="00:21:03.250">here that the very for this variable id...</p>
      <p begin="00:21:03.250" end="00:21:09.070">I can also use of the other advanced refactoring features, for example.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:09.070" end="00:21:12.050">Glanced coding features like refactoring</p>
      <p begin="00:21:12.050" end="00:21:16.890">...twenty fifteen we also released the ability to be able to refactoring</p>
      <p begin="00:21:16.890" end="00:21:20.900">...code now that parameter name I don't particularly like that name</p>
      <p begin="00:21:20.900" end="00:21:23.090">bad engine bad demo doesn't some...</p>
      <p begin="00:21:23.090" end="00:21:28.040">great so actually going to change that now so for doing this I'm going to use the refactoring feature</p>
      <p begin="00:21:28.040" end="00:21:36.010">...to go and say we name I want to chain this...good engine great demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:36.010" end="00:21:40.080">So, notice what I click preview it actually gives me the uses of this</p>
      <p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:44.650">particular type across my source file I can select or</p>
      <p begin="00:21:44.650" end="00:21:47.930">...based upon my intuition and based upon where</p>
      <p begin="00:21:47.930" end="00:21:55.190">this changes being made for now I'm going to click apply and hope everything works.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:55.190" end="00:21:59.970">Now next...show you...to debugging experience so for doing so I'm going to set up a variety of</p>
      <p begin="00:21:59.970" end="00:22:01.910">...points here.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:01.910" end="00:22:06.600">Park box there we go there's a big points that I'm setting</p>
      <p begin="00:22:06.600" end="00:22:11.300">and that will allow me to show you guys debugging experience so notice</p>
      <p begin="00:22:12.360" end="00:22:16.010">the...many here dropout many is already populated with</p>
      <p begin="00:22:16.010" end="00:22:21.390">the simulator entry this is the fast x eighty-six hyper be ways to microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:22:21.390" end="00:22:23.620">...emulator.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:23.620" end="00:22:27.080">This is already running in the...let me show you guys this.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:27.080" end="00:22:28.690">Very quickly so that's the</p>
      <p begin="00:22:28.690" end="00:22:33.490">...running their since I already have the running next is going to have five which</p>
      <p begin="00:22:33.490" end="00:22:39.800">will build my application and deployed to emulator.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:39.800" end="00:22:43.170">So, there we go the applications getting built.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:43.170" end="00:22:48.180">And, now...getting copied and install to emulator notice that the break one</p>
      <p begin="00:22:48.180" end="00:22:49.980">...that was had.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:49.980" end="00:22:54.610">Before we go ahead and look into the debugging experience focus let's focus on this</p>
      <p begin="00:22:54.610" end="00:22:59.850">tool and underweight this is the...android...window</p>
      <p begin="00:22:59.850" end="00:23:04.450">anti-lock had is a debugging and diagnostic tool that and provides</p>
      <p begin="00:23:04.450" end="00:23:09.270">gatehousemedia view the system debug output and this can be particularly useful that I'm actually debugging</p>
      <p begin="00:23:09.270" end="00:23:14.690">of my app when let's say...startup and it's hard to attach the mother so on so I can add</p>
      <p begin="00:23:14.690" end="00:23:18.840">my log messages there and see what's going on so as a part of experience</p>
      <p begin="00:23:18.840" end="00:23:23.550">we've also integrated some of the and debugging tools and diagnostic tools here right into your core editing and</p>
      <p begin="00:23:23.550" end="00:23:26.590">debugging experience as you can see for now</p>
      <p begin="00:23:26.590" end="00:23:30.230">...continue which allow me to show you guys the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:30.230" end="00:23:33.970">...message lighting up here.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:33.970" end="00:23:37.070">So, I'm going-to go ahead and continue again.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:37.070" end="00:23:41.860">And, now let's...talking about the debugging experience here are the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:41.860" end="00:23:46.620">...is ...or essentially based on the android...layer of software</p>
      <p begin="00:23:46.620" end="00:23:51.000">that gets provided as you can see it's very similar to any debugging</p>
      <p begin="00:23:51.000" end="00:23:52.870">...windows code you can go ahead</p>
      <p begin="00:23:52.870" end="00:23:57.520">...points all your regular stuff like the autos window here let me</p>
      <p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:24:03.280">...that the locals window all that kind of stuff lights up nicely</p>
      <p begin="00:24:03.280" end="00:24:08.250">...stack will allow you to view the call stack was application as you can see...the android</p>
      <p begin="00:24:08.250" end="00:24:14.650">main function...we currently only support debugging cplus-plus code today.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:14.650" end="00:24:19.080">You can also go to break points window can see the different break points that you guys have said here</p>
      <p begin="00:24:19.080" end="00:24:21.610">...different source lines that I have.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:21.610" end="00:24:25.010">And,...this is not enough and you see...you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:25.010" end="00:24:29.180">users who...using this from command-line perspective you can also taskmaster directly to</p>
      <p begin="00:24:29.180" end="00:24:34.150">gdp so I can go ahead and said debug gb exec and say</p>
      <p begin="00:24:34.150" end="00:24:38.060">bt visual give-me-a-call stack.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:38.060" end="00:24:45.060">And, as you can see that's exactly the same thing the...was...an android main so on.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:45.060" end="00:24:48.590">So, that said I'm actually going to go ahead and</p>
      <p begin="00:24:48.590" end="00:24:51.110">the delete my break points here.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:51.110" end="00:25:00.050">So, I can show you the app running yes I want to be able to do that and...continue.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:00.050" end="00:25:02.600">So, that's the app running</p>
      <p begin="00:25:02.600" end="00:25:08.840">on the emulatorI have a touch-screen luckily so I can do stuff like this.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:08.840" end="00:25:13.800">And, as I mentioned the microsoft...emulator provides in addition to being fasten based</p>
      <p begin="00:25:13.800" end="00:25:16.870">on x eighty-six...also provides me inability of</p>
      <p begin="00:25:16.870" end="00:25:20.950">...of sensors that I can use so not only can actually play around from</p>
      <p begin="00:25:20.950" end="00:25:24.740">attach perspective I can also play from...perspective...</p>
      <p begin="00:25:24.740" end="00:25:32.020">on the multi touch mode and then I can do something like...to zoom or I can shun the...together.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:32.020" end="00:25:35.410">Let's do this we go and if I if I</p>
      <p begin="00:25:35.410" end="00:25:40.640">want to bring them back will actually come back as...finishes.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:44.600">I can also do other things here...</p>
      <p begin="00:25:44.600" end="00:25:47.590">... I can also do other things here, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:47.590" end="00:25:51.670">I can go ahead and change the rotation that I</p>
      <p begin="00:25:51.670" end="00:25:56.520">have from application I can change rotation for the emulator itself.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:56.520" end="00:26:01.240">And, then figure out how map looks like in different ...as user actually, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:01.240" end="00:26:07.380">prefers user vertical orientation versus the horizontal orientation that's not going</p>
      <p begin="00:26:07.380" end="00:26:12.650">...relaunch this.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:12.650" end="00:26:16.110">It's actually really fast the loop here for being able to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:16.110" end="00:26:21.990">deploying debug you can see here now like I can actually play the layouts here.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:21.990" end="00:26:23.870">But,...experienced just doesn't</p>
      <p begin="00:26:23.870" end="00:26:28.240">end there the annan emulator also provides you with another part of</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.240" end="00:26:32.970">sensors a you guys can use for testing your application under great</p>
      <p begin="00:26:32.970" end="00:26:37.790">similar environments which are hard to reproducing...world so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:37.790" end="00:26:43.470">when I bring up this additional tools window you can see the kilometer sensor location</p>
      <p begin="00:26:43.470" end="00:26:47.590">sensor that we provide so I can actually go look for space needle here?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:47.590" end="00:26:49.770">And, you'll see that come up and you can use this information</p>
      <p begin="00:26:49.770" end="00:26:54.880">...app so on I can simulate my app under different network speeds.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:26:59.690">If you if you guys are be can...players ...you know, playing the last life there this</p>
      <p begin="00:26:59.690" end="00:27:04.220">might be important so on so using these kind of techniques you can actually really</p>
      <p begin="00:27:04.220" end="00:27:12.040">test your app in a very good...environment and make sure that works for users so on.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:12.040" end="00:27:29.860">So, that said this actually brings me to the end of the first demo and I'm going to back go back</p>
      <p begin="00:27:29.860" end="00:27:33.140">So, the question let me rephrase the question if I'm...right so you</p>
      <p begin="00:27:33.140" end="00:27:38.050">add the question is that what about apps that have java code in them and what a</p>
      <p begin="00:27:38.050" end="00:27:44.040">bad building them and being able to debug them so on so you see notice here</p>
      <p begin="00:27:44.040" end="00:27:50.640">if and I was doing the demo I can probably go back to mine the machine here quickly?</p>
      <p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:57.310">You'll notice that we have to projects here we have the...project...the packaging project.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:57.310" end="00:27:59.200">The packaging project essentially</p>
      <p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:03.600">...right now and has the capability to build java code?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:09.060">Viet stone support you know, a language service experience for java and debugging for java</p>
      <p begin="00:28:09.060" end="00:28:13.160">Again, is you know, something that you might take a look at based on the feedback that we get from</p>
      <p begin="00:28:13.160" end="00:28:21.780">...so on I hope that answers your question sir thank you any...</p>
      <p begin="00:28:21.780" end="00:28:26.080">...again, in the emulator yes I believe there's...support</p>
      <p begin="00:28:26.080" end="00:28:30.870">their and that if you guys when...meeting at the builds we can probably work and,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:30.870" end="00:28:36.720">talk or...that?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:36.720" end="00:28:40.820">Viet don't have any tools for performance profiling as a part of the integrated</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.820" end="00:28:44.610">...experience but there are tools out there that you guys can use and top of</p>
      <p begin="00:28:44.610" end="00:28:55.620">...tool chain you guys might now I might take just one more question there actually.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:55.620" end="00:28:59.170">So, the question is are any of these tools going-to be automated</p>
      <p begin="00:28:59.170" end="00:29:03.320">...the provide support for automation for testing frameworks so on</p>
      <p begin="00:29:03.320" end="00:29:09.060">...the answers that so currently you know, so, this is essentially you're exactly</p>
      <p begin="00:29:09.060" end="00:29:10.950">...tool chain that we provide...mean, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:10.950" end="00:29:15.640">from my perspective if you guys want to be able to use, you know, your command-line test cases frame</p>
      <p begin="00:29:15.640" end="00:29:20.160">is build and be able to drive the indicate build or drive the build system that we have</p>
      <p begin="00:29:20.160" end="00:29:24.760">four android here which is based...build you guys can do that but we don't have ourselves</p>
      <p begin="00:29:24.760" end="00:29:33.020">any test tools that we integrated from a test unit testing perspective automation framework at.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:33.020" end="00:29:37.690">So, that saidI'm going to go into my next demo and by the way here</p>
      <p begin="00:29:39.090" end="00:29:42.830">...again.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:42.830" end="00:29:47.310">Here are so the features that we talk about here we talk about building and</p>
      <p begin="00:29:47.310" end="00:29:52.590">native activity the client dc tool chain refactoring intel's since the...native debug are</p>
      <p begin="00:29:52.590" end="00:29:57.050">...and fast emulation now everything I've shown you for debugging right here you</p>
      <p begin="00:29:57.050" end="00:30:02.040">guys can also bringing you existing or application from whatever id they're using and you</p>
      <p begin="00:30:02.040" end="00:30:06.560">can debug that...studio...provide support for that as well if you have time will get into</p>
      <p begin="00:30:06.560" end="00:30:11.190">that demo soif you go ahead and go to next gemini.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:11.190" end="00:30:14.380">So, the next demo here so this is a cross-platform talk right so I</p>
      <p begin="00:30:14.380" end="00:30:17.310">...start simple...the providing...overview what you've</p>
      <p begin="00:30:17.310" end="00:30:22.280">...android...the next application that I'm going to show you guys this is a cross-platform</p>
      <p begin="00:30:22.280" end="00:30:27.280">...targeting the windows and the android platform the application is</p>
      <p begin="00:30:27.280" end="00:30:31.670">call image manipulation and what it does is that it takes the life...it takes a</p>
      <p begin="00:30:31.670" end="00:30:35.870">...camera feed and it's able to run a variety of image</p>
      <p begin="00:30:35.870" end="00:30:38.260">filters on it you can run image reductions</p>
      <p begin="00:30:38.260" end="00:30:42.700">...cooler...and all that kind of stuff and the application filters that I just talked</p>
      <p begin="00:30:42.700" end="00:30:50.910">about our cross-platform cplus-plus which makes a majority of this application?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:50.910" end="00:30:52.310">To demo this let me actually</p>
      <p begin="00:30:52.310" end="00:30:57.870">start which showing you guys the app itself so you guys can understand where I'm coming from.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:57.870" end="00:31:01.440">Someone move back to my micro html here.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:06.250">...one of...devices so this is not...emulator this is a third-party software</p>
      <p begin="00:31:06.250" end="00:31:13.410">...using which allows me to screencast map so, let me show the app itself now.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:13.410" end="00:31:18.450">So, here we go here's the app so you can see I can take I can take a</p>
      <p begin="00:31:18.450" end="00:31:21.330">life camera feed let's take this phone, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:21.330" end="00:31:25.050">and, actually I can overlay taus on it and then I can move these...</p>
      <p begin="00:31:28.250" end="00:31:32.390">...can also do...effects I can actually go here and now use the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:32.390" end="00:31:40.040">more filter more filter vo works better with light here we go common.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:40.040" end="00:31:44.470">...good so the...actually add the more fact to your</p>
      <p begin="00:31:44.470" end="00:31:51.570">life camera feed we have also other sensors like...sensor visual...reduction so on.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:51.570" end="00:31:56.690">And, just for...back now just...cakes we also have the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:56.690" end="00:32:06.000">...the same application running...the windows devices well.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:09.890">So, let's go there so let me show that as well as...</p>
      <p begin="00:32:09.890" end="00:32:12.940">So, that's that operate here.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:12.940" end="00:32:15.680">I can actually again take the...camera feeds is going to</p>
      <p begin="00:32:15.680" end="00:32:21.300">...hard to do I can do like image reduction on it and,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:21.300" end="00:32:26.230">...can image reduction on it so on and rescinded back to rgb so I</p>
      <p begin="00:32:26.230" end="00:32:31.970">can do the exact same stuff that I was doing online or application is the point so</p>
      <p begin="00:32:31.970" end="00:32:35.370">...said let's take a look at how this applications architected</p>
      <p begin="00:32:36.610" end="00:32:41.370">as...doing that I will demo some of our cross-platform features so</p>
      <p begin="00:32:41.370" end="00:32:46.310">...done with the solution someone open my next...makes solution so we're currently</p>
      <p begin="00:32:46.310" end="00:32:51.090">working on making this sample available as well for you guys you guys can go ahead and online</p>
      <p begin="00:32:51.090" end="00:32:55.520">and download this...currently not available online.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:55.520" end="00:32:57.010">So, let's take a look here as I</p>
      <p begin="00:32:57.010" end="00:33:01.500">mentioned the image manipulation app is a cross-platform cplus-plus application</p>
      <p begin="00:33:01.500" end="00:33:07.080">...targets the android and the windows platform if you take a look.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:07.080" end="00:33:10.590">At the library in the image...library folder here you see</p>
      <p begin="00:33:10.590" end="00:33:14.710">to projects you'll see the image filters android project and you'll see the image</p>
      <p begin="00:33:14.710" end="00:33:18.550">filters windows project both these projects essentially,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:18.550" end="00:33:20.880">for example, the image filters android project.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:21.920" end="00:33:25.760">Reference the image filters dot shared component and</p>
      <p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:30.370">this shared component essentially which is right here.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:30.370" end="00:33:34.890">Is all the cross-platform cplus-plus codes all this code here is cross-platform</p>
      <p begin="00:33:34.890" end="00:33:42.070">cplus-plus and it's getting reference both in the android project...in this project?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:42.070" end="00:33:46.730">Let's actually go ahead and build...now so you guys can see what happens enable this the mean</p>
      <p begin="00:33:46.730" end="00:33:49.730">...remove my...file here.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:49.730" end="00:33:55.000">And, let's go and build the.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:55.000" end="00:33:57.010">Let's go and build a...project.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:00.250" end="00:34:02.670">...we...already built.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:05.480" end="00:34:11.510">So, notice as...building it will actually start the building all the cross-platform code here so if</p>
      <p begin="00:34:11.510" end="00:34:16.510">you take a look here and compare this to this output this is actually pretty much the same</p>
      <p begin="00:34:16.510" end="00:34:19.690">seatbelts the shared code.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:21.100" end="00:34:24.950">And, it also those the when android specific piece of code</p>
      <p begin="00:34:24.950" end="00:34:27.130">...all the shared code right here, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:27.130" end="00:34:31.760">the filters out to...histogram cp and then...the android specific</p>
      <p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:38.230">code component and produces us dot a file or static library.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:38.230" end="00:34:41.920">If I now go ahead and build the windows project which also</p>
      <p begin="00:34:41.920" end="00:34:46.660">references the shared component here you guys are going to see exactly the same thing as well it</p>
      <p begin="00:34:46.660" end="00:34:51.090">will also build the shared code here using a different compiler</p>
      <p begin="00:34:51.090" end="00:34:55.769">...using the vc compiler now all the shared code here.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:55.769" end="00:35:00.339">And, it will also then build the windows specific piece of code which is actually right here in</p>
      <p begin="00:35:00.339" end="00:35:03.499">the windows project itself this is also building static</p>
      <p begin="00:35:03.499" end="00:35:08.489">library these static libraries are then used in these projects here, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:08.489" end="00:35:12.989">dynamic...packaging project and the image manipulation windows set of projects here to</p>
      <p begin="00:35:12.989" end="00:35:17.150">building end-to-end android and windows application.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:17.150" end="00:35:21.830">So, using this kind of approach you can actually share your cross-platform cplus-plus</p>
      <p begin="00:35:21.830" end="00:35:25.550">...using this kind of a project structure also if you</p>
      <p begin="00:35:25.550" end="00:35:29.980">notice this solution has to projects android and windows as building and...windows</p>
      <p begin="00:35:29.980" end="00:35:34.500">that I can actually go ahead right click on the solution and build for windows</p>
      <p begin="00:35:34.500" end="00:35:35.500">an android simultaneously.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:36.980" end="00:35:41.530">This will take some time so at this point I...look for some questions you have any questions and how the sharing</p>
      <p begin="00:35:41.530" end="00:35:51.610">...stuff works?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:51.610" end="00:35:55.820">Yeah, I will...all the...files and all that kind of stuff that so the question is actually between</p>
      <p begin="00:35:55.820" end="00:36:00.650">...files and stuff like that you.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:00.650" end="00:36:04.190">No, it's not...linux yet I would say not</p>
      <p begin="00:36:04.190" end="00:36:11.840">known ever but not yet...here's a question the...as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:11.840" end="00:36:15.930">Right so how you handle independent dealers so if you notice you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:15.930" end="00:36:20.100">there is the...project itself and the windows project here you can actually go ahead</p>
      <p begin="00:36:20.100" end="00:36:25.180">right click here called the property pages and you can actually go let's say</p>
      <p begin="00:36:25.180" end="00:36:29.450">in your librarian here in this case is a static library so maybe not there.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:29.450" end="00:36:33.880">But, I can go ahead and my native activity project which is actually referencing the static lab that we just</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.880" end="00:36:37.650">...go in the link or providers inputs whatever my lab dependencies</p>
      <p begin="00:36:37.650" end="00:36:42.840">are and I can do exactly the same thing in the windows project as well and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:42.840" end="00:36:48.060">reference my components the share progress structures there for one purpose for sharing that cross-platform</p>
      <p begin="00:36:48.060" end="00:36:52.950">...cplus-plus code and that's pretty much it is almost like a folder we build that</p>
      <p begin="00:36:52.950" end="00:36:57.160">...twice using different compilers feynman...the thing is that</p>
      <p begin="00:36:57.160" end="00:37:01.500">you don't have to tvs you-can from one-click builds the solution and you get</p>
      <p begin="00:37:01.500" end="00:37:06.420">to projects here...applications...one for windows and one for android and...can extend this</p>
      <p begin="00:37:06.420" end="00:37:11.860">files as well if you like...crash so take a look here here's my image manipulation</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.860" end="00:37:15.530">...that garbled which is the windows application</p>
      <p begin="00:37:15.530" end="00:37:22.070">and here I have the image manipulation android on a became which is my android into an application.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:22.070" end="00:37:26.890">Does anybody finds cool you think this is good?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:26.890" end="00:37:28.800">All right so the next thing I'm sure you guys</p>
      <p begin="00:37:28.800" end="00:37:35.070">then is I'm actually going to go ahead and add a new filter here in measured</p>
      <p begin="00:37:35.070" end="00:37:38.760">code the beauty of cplus-plus obviously is that now that actually?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:40.020" end="00:37:43.930">Have all this cross-platform ness available to me adding new</p>
      <p begin="00:37:43.930" end="00:37:48.880">features easy because I only have to add them once so I'm going to go back to</p>
      <p begin="00:37:52.410" end="00:37:58.000">And, copy that into here also while you guys</p>
      <p begin="00:37:58.000" end="00:38:02.560">...looking I'm going to make some other edits.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:02.560" end="00:38:09.610">And, go back to my...added.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09.610" end="00:38:11.300">...back to filter's.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:12.450" end="00:38:14.440">Go back to find features.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:15.850" end="00:38:17.950">Right here notice</p>
      <p begin="00:38:17.950" end="00:38:22.430">has added this code you will see multi-color squiggles lighting up</p>
      <p begin="00:38:22.430" end="00:38:27.060">different colors...is read this is purple so on and color-blind so-and-so</p>
      <p begin="00:38:27.060" end="00:38:32.530">...level by us mood...anybody in the room know what these different kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:38:32.530" end="00:38:35.920">...google's...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:35.920" end="00:38:41.630">...take a guess.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:43.130" end="00:38:47.310">And, purple is good that's good no it's you close.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:47.310" end="00:38:52.160">As anybody else in one...this.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:52.160" end="00:38:56.870">So, the multi-cores google sega is a seeing a light up here is because what I've just</p>
      <p begin="00:38:56.870" end="00:39:00.960">...that I've taken ish I've ever open up my shared source file is</p>
      <p begin="00:39:00.960" end="00:39:04.070">filters on cp...added code there</p>
      <p begin="00:39:04.070" end="00:39:08.730">that is not platform agnostic is platform dependent if I</p>
      <p begin="00:39:08.730" end="00:39:14.530">hope over the squiggles you'll notice that when I...the enrich google you'll notice here this is a windows</p>
      <p begin="00:39:14.530" end="00:39:18.730">...explains lining up and it's telling me that this api message that of added</p>
      <p begin="00:39:18.730" end="00:39:23.730">is actually specific to the...to the...platform and the windows intel's actually doesn't</p>
      <p begin="00:39:23.730" end="00:39:28.630">...this likewise if I homer over the mone twenty-eight intrinsic types this</p>
      <p begin="00:39:28.630" end="00:39:32.700">...language extension the microsoft provides an over here this is the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:32.700" end="00:39:37.190">...experience lighting up and telling me that I don't know what to do this is definitely</p>
      <p begin="00:39:37.190" end="00:39:41.260">...so using this experience from cross-platform</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.260" end="00:39:45.950">intelligence perspective...you working or shared layer of code we will be able to save</p>
      <p begin="00:39:45.950" end="00:39:50.810">you time by telling a design-time the code that you've added is not going to</p>
      <p begin="00:39:50.810" end="00:39:55.630">build...is going to build or not...for all your platforms.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:55.630" end="00:39:59.620">And, this is actually not even compiling your code.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:59.620" end="00:40:04.420">Also something else I should mention here is that if you look at the allocation of this feature</p>
      <p begin="00:40:04.420" end="00:40:08.710">...detector which is open cv type you'll notice that there is</p>
      <p begin="00:40:08.710" end="00:40:11.990">...their squiggles appearing here to both for the and platform and the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:11.990" end="00:40:16.720">wing of platform that's because I'm actually using different versions of the open</p>
      <p begin="00:40:16.720" end="00:40:22.920">...library for these...for the windows platform and the from the...for the...platform so at</p>
      <p begin="00:40:22.920" end="00:40:28.890">this point either have a choice to go ahead and use a different kind of feature detector.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:28.890" end="00:40:30.670">Or I can actually go ahead and</p>
      <p begin="00:40:30.670" end="00:40:34.930">...my code given the lazy programmer that I am.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.930" end="00:40:38.360">I'm going to if my code.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:38.360" end="00:40:45.060">So, here's my if that's coming back to life.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:45.060" end="00:40:47.310">Notice as the if...take</p>
      <p begin="00:40:47.310" end="00:40:52.260">effect at that currently you'll see the android section of code is fades away</p>
      <p begin="00:40:52.260" end="00:40:58.480">and that's because currently we have chosen the windows specific context for intelligence.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:58.480" end="00:41:01.240">If I go ahead and choose now the android specific context</p>
      <p begin="00:41:01.240" end="00:41:05.170">...or...language services...android portion of code is</p>
      <p begin="00:41:05.170" end="00:41:10.640">now highlighted and the windows portion fades away so this is essentially one of our value</p>
      <p begin="00:41:10.640" end="00:41:14.280">...server offering many working in that share layer of code to be able to use</p>
      <p begin="00:41:14.280" end="00:41:21.860">features like this to help you guys when...when you're developing that cross-platform layer of super-fast...</p>
      <p begin="00:41:21.860" end="00:41:24.400">So, for now I'm actually going to go ahead and</p>
      <p begin="00:41:24.400" end="00:41:29.910">build this app I was a nice enough to tell you guys what...does.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:29.910" end="00:41:32.430">And,...what this new filter does?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:32.430" end="00:41:35.560">This filter that I just added what it does is that it takes life camera</p>
      <p begin="00:41:35.560" end="00:41:40.660">feed and find interesting feature points, for example,...and edges so</p>
      <p begin="00:41:40.660" end="00:41:45.280">on this is kind of like the stuff that you do with real-time computer vision for being able to</p>
      <p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:50.890">track object movement and that kind of stuff so let's go ahead and show you guys</p>
      <p begin="00:41:50.890" end="00:41:55.090">the app itself so for doing so I'm going-to go ahead</p>
      <p begin="00:41:55.090" end="00:42:01.350">set my startup project as the packaging project which is my...projects.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:01.350" end="00:42:05.520">As you see the devices actually change here points to my lg nexis</p>
      <p begin="00:42:05.520" end="00:42:10.290">five device I'm going to hit a five here which is going to build map again.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:10.290" end="00:42:15.030">And, deploy to medios.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:15.030" end="00:42:18.430">...security stuff that we need to run.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:18.430" end="00:42:21.920">So, you can see now that the application is being built and gets</p>
      <p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:26.350">applied to my device I will bring up my third-party</p>
      <p begin="00:42:26.350" end="00:42:29.810">...screencast here again which is going to be friendly</p>
      <p begin="00:42:29.810" end="00:42:34.250">...hope again we go so that's the app again and now you can see</p>
      <p begin="00:42:34.250" end="00:42:35.630">whoops.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:35.630" end="00:42:40.090">...go back to the app.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:40.090" end="00:42:43.280">Have really...fingers anyways?</p>
      <p begin="00:42:43.280" end="00:42:45.270">Here we go.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:45.270" end="00:42:50.350">...that didn't look right...give me a second let me kill this app</p>
      <p begin="00:42:50.350" end="00:43:00.100">...deploy it ...five again.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:00.100" end="00:43:05.540">We...we go and notice how...you guys can see</p>
      <p begin="00:43:06.550" end="00:43:11.090">Notice have when I'm actually doing this and using the feature find objects.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:11.090" end="00:43:18.370">It goes ahead and who doesn't seem to be able to...up right now?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:18.370" end="00:43:20.980">Whoops.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:20.980" end="00:43:23.790">We'll...if you see here is actually</p>
      <p begin="00:43:23.790" end="00:43:27.400">...up nicely even having the camera close this need to focus notice</p>
      <p begin="00:43:27.400" end="00:43:31.210">...actually getting all my source code and lighting up all the edges and the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:31.210" end="00:43:35.180">corners and the text if I do in the key bode.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:35.180" end="00:43:38.980">It works better lighting you'll notice that it's picking up all the texan</p>
      <p begin="00:43:38.980" end="00:43:43.020">...keys so on so you guys can see, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:43.020" end="00:43:47.820">lifers eleven developed here now how we do...time so within</p>
      <p begin="00:43:47.820" end="00:43:51.740">...time great so I can so when I'm actually build</p>
      <p begin="00:43:51.740" end="00:43:56.700">...app now and this new filter I also have...working...for the windows platform as well so</p>
      <p begin="00:43:56.700" end="00:44:01.780">I can then use the exact same application and on the same find features filter and be</p>
      <p begin="00:44:01.780" end="00:44:05.890">able to run and use the same feature added because I was working</p>
      <p begin="00:44:05.890" end="00:44:10.960">that cross-platform surpasses there again so that's the end of the second</p>
      <p begin="00:44:10.960" end="00:44:14.860">...so I'm going to go back to my slider?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:14.860" end="00:44:18.360">Remember weapons later so you guys sign this one so,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:18.360" end="00:44:23.290">these capabilities how...cross-platform mobile app how easily...code between platforms</p>

      <p begin="00:44:47.900" end="00:44:54.540">And, we also showed here in this demo how to build simultaneously multiple platforms so I believe mandel</p>
      <p begin="00:44:54.540" end="00:44:59.420">read this demo where she showed how to build how to use bringing you existing and</p>
      <p begin="00:44:59.420" end="00:45:04.490">...and then debugged using visual studio so I'm going to skip that but if you look at the</p>
      <p begin="00:45:04.490" end="00:45:08.370">slides there's all the nodes...so you guys can do that...</p>
      <p begin="00:45:08.370" end="00:45:12.750">The you can also...talks about it.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:12.750" end="00:45:16.400">Now so something else that I want to sharedyou know,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:21.390">when you guys today is basically a new announcement every making the visual see...twenty fifteen</p>
      <p begin="00:45:21.390" end="00:45:26.240">other folks in the back room somewhere there asking questions about ios earlier starting with the</p>
      <p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:30.530">twenty fifteen rc build developers will also be able to leverage</p>
      <p begin="00:45:30.530" end="00:45:35.510">...tool chain in visual cplus-plus to target and build ios</p>
      <p begin="00:45:35.510" end="00:45:36.510">minors</p>
      <p begin="00:45:36.510" end="00:45:42.700">...applications that you can debug and deploys your device to the simulator so on?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:42.700" end="00:45:47.630">You'll be able to not only build...application but you also be able to edit them debug</p>
      <p begin="00:45:47.630" end="00:45:52.030">them...about editing here you can use all the features that I just showed you...cross-platform</p>
      <p begin="00:45:52.030" end="00:45:57.360">...perspective from refactoring perspective so on also will</p>
      <p begin="00:45:57.360" end="00:45:59.850">...the same cross-platform...features and edges download</p>
      <p begin="00:45:59.850" end="00:46:06.010">...of sharing your code easily across these platforms so that said I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:46:06.010" end="00:46:11.020">going-to go ahead on the last one that I have for you guys today which is building</p>
      <p begin="00:46:11.020" end="00:46:15.250">and ios application now what I do with this one so this application here that</p>
      <p begin="00:46:15.250" end="00:46:20.380">I will show you guys now is an open gl eds application it's got this</p>
      <p begin="00:46:20.380" end="00:46:26.910">...sharing open geo code between an annual application and, I was application?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:26.910" end="00:46:29.250">So, let's go ahead and show you</p>
      <p begin="00:46:29.250" end="00:46:32.950">guys that now so in the meantime you guys have any questions.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:34.010" end="00:46:45.320">Regarding yes sir.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:45.320" end="00:46:52.300">...I couldn't hear your lesser.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:52.300" end="00:46:55.820">Yes, you can actually do that so if you if you if you take a look at the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:55.820" end="00:47:00.450">and you'll see that again this demo essentially the question is how do I associate certain</p>
      <p begin="00:47:00.450" end="00:47:03.200">bill files to be associated one platform is that</p>
      <p begin="00:47:03.200" end="00:47:08.110">correct so the way the way this structure for sharing code works is that you</p>
      <p begin="00:47:08.110" end="00:47:13.310">...an android specific project let's say a windows specific project again</p>
      <p begin="00:47:13.310" end="00:47:18.810">then you have a shared component the shared component include all your shared code the android specific component</p>
      <p begin="00:47:18.810" end="00:47:23.760">project...include you android specific code so that's how you differentiate between the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:23.760" end="00:47:32.630">android specific sources and the shared sources there I hope that answer your question sir.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:32.630" end="00:47:37.210">I'm going to go back here so here is my...the you guys can see I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:47:37.210" end="00:47:41.940">using parallels here so let me just bring back from a.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:41.940" end="00:47:42.440">Video.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:43.500" end="00:47:46.060">So, I'm running automatic currently and I'm running</p>
      <p begin="00:47:46.060" end="00:47:52.110">...on my windows vm so this solution that I'm showing you guys</p>
      <p begin="00:47:52.110" end="00:47:59.340">night now is essentially the following experience if you go...filing project.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:59.340" end="00:48:03.850">This is this template right here nothing fancy about this and what this template is</p>
      <p begin="00:48:03.850" end="00:48:09.840">building is essentially a cross-platform application targeting android and ios?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:09.840" end="00:48:13.270">So, if you take a look here again in this project structure now you'll</p>
      <p begin="00:48:13.270" end="00:48:18.120">notice in the libraries folder you have android native activity project which is</p>
      <p begin="00:48:18.120" end="00:48:22.950">...which references the open geo cross-platform app dot shared component which is right</p>
      <p begin="00:48:22.950" end="00:48:27.670">here since referencing this source failure and this project as I</p>
      <p begin="00:48:27.670" end="00:48:34.270">showed you earlier is building a dynamic share library already ll for the and platform?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:34.270" end="00:48:37.140">The other project here that I'm demo ing which is also</p>
      <p begin="00:48:37.140" end="00:48:40.290">parallel libraries project here is the open geo</p>
      <p begin="00:48:40.290" end="00:48:45.180">...cross-platform app not ios abstract static library project?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:45.180" end="00:48:49.740">This project here is building and ios specific library.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:49.740" end="00:48:57.380">Its and io static libm in this case it also references that cross-platform code which is open right here.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:57.380" end="00:49:02.290">So, for our experience ...legal reasons mostly you still need</p>
      <p begin="00:49:02.290" end="00:49:05.450">...require...running in the background which basically</p>
      <p begin="00:49:05.450" end="00:49:10.260">...build host and that's where all the action happens but you can as you can see you can</p>
      <p begin="00:49:10.260" end="00:49:14.450">actually code debug build everything inside of visual studio we take care of</p>
      <p begin="00:49:14.450" end="00:49:19.310">...that and we taker bringing their messages back so on.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:19.310" end="00:49:24.050">Now let me-let me show you guys some of the source code here so for doing so I'm going to bring up go back to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:24.050" end="00:49:29.480">my image filter sure ...computer.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:29.480" end="00:49:33.470">I'm going to go back to my open gl cross-platform</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.470" end="00:49:37.950">...not shared component and...bring up...gutsy.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:37.950" end="00:49:42.620">also I'm going to make sure that I choose the static library.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:42.620" end="00:49:46.760">Or the iosspecific intel's experience here.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:46.760" end="00:49:51.570">As high go to my...method in this case you'll notice that we've actually done the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:51.570" end="00:49:56.730">work to bring up the intel's...for ios as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:56.730" end="00:50:00.430">All the other language features that you guys are used to on the windows</p>
      <p begin="00:50:00.430" end="00:50:05.240">platform and now hopefully in the...platform...well work here...well, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:05.240" end="00:50:13.600">I can go ahead and say showman definition of this particular type and...definition work for you.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:13.600" end="00:50:17.980">So, that's some of our language...feature all other features like refactoring and all that</p>
      <p begin="00:50:17.980" end="00:50:23.770">...works here as well so let's now go ahead and build this ios app</p>
      <p begin="00:50:23.770" end="00:50:28.210">rate so for doing so I essentially have.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:28.210" end="00:50:29.390">Going to move out of...</p>
      <p begin="00:50:30.920" end="00:50:38.190">Wing of rugby...to move out of the shared space here and.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:38.190" end="00:50:43.140">Chugai something else now so as soon as you guys can see that.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:43.140" end="00:50:48.220">All right so here I'm going to start up my.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:48.220" end="00:50:55.790">...remote which is essentially a node...which listens for requests from and visuals to instance.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:55.790" end="00:51:00.330">I'm not going to go back to...my visual studio and I'm going-to go ahead</p>
      <p begin="00:51:00.330" end="00:51:07.900">and say that please build me my ios application.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:07.900" end="00:51:15.980">Asses app is getting...you'll notice the output window leaving this back.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:15.980" end="00:51:19.500">You'll see in the output...that this is actually building</p>
      <p begin="00:51:19.500" end="00:51:25.190">mayo stuff here for me so in this case both the projects that we had which is</p>
      <p begin="00:51:25.190" end="00:51:31.140">the ios application project and the as static library project...</p>
      <p begin="00:51:31.140" end="00:51:31.860">Thanks I will show you</p>
      <p begin="00:51:31.860" end="00:51:38.740">...debugging experience so for doing so I'm going to several break point here and I'm going to hit fife.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:38.740" end="00:51:43.800">Getting aiff will try to deploy them the application the ios application on my</p>
      <p begin="00:51:43.800" end="00:51:48.200">device which is right here you can see screencast that right here</p>
      <p begin="00:51:48.200" end="00:51:53.160">notice that the application at this...deployed and if I go</p>
      <p begin="00:51:53.160" end="00:51:56.020">back to my demo here.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:56.020" end="00:52:01.350">Let's continue with that sorry let's try this again.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:01.350" end="00:52:04.960">Less concurrent apply...application again.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:04.960" end="00:52:10.110">Go back to my screen.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:10.110" end="00:52:14.110">And, let's go back to bs now again sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:14.110" end="00:52:19.660">And, you'll notice that...break point as...was actually hit.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:19.660" end="00:52:24.390">So, as you guys can see not only can we build...applications we can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:52:24.390" end="00:52:29.830">...them using visual studio since because this is the first it's actually</p>
      <p begin="00:52:29.830" end="00:52:35.430">the firstoccurrence of the break...getting hit in the cubed...function when</p>
      <p begin="00:52:35.430" end="00:52:42.580">actually hit continue this is the first-time the shape online device will be rendered.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:42.580" end="00:52:48.550">When keeping continue here...those threads again sorry?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:48.550" end="00:52:51.280">The screencast...actually working...the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:51.280" end="00:52:55.530">...expenses working so what's happening here when we're actually building this application is</p>
      <p begin="00:52:55.530" end="00:53:00.690">that in secret we're doing is that we're taking the vc express project which is the</p>
      <p begin="00:53:00.690" end="00:53:04.830">...static library project and the as application project and we produce</p>
      <p begin="00:53:04.830" end="00:53:07.350">...project out of it then we take that</p>
      <p begin="00:53:07.350" end="00:53:13.270">...project and...pass that over to our remote the...tool that's running on the</p>
      <p begin="00:53:13.270" end="00:53:18.230">...which is relation running on the...it takes...called project bills it produces</p>
      <p begin="00:53:18.230" end="00:53:22.760">the ipa file and then you can take that ipa file and...can deploy to a device or</p>
      <p begin="00:53:22.760" end="00:53:36.310">similar you can do all this stuff from bs...you can build so on.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:36.310" end="00:53:40.340">Right so that's...so I'm glad you brought that up so let me go back here</p>
      <p begin="00:53:40.340" end="00:53:44.040">what building the way so currently the bits...offering for</p>
      <p begin="00:53:44.040" end="00:53:49.060">...experience are this is kind of like our current thinking at this point so,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:49.060" end="00:53:52.400">you'll see that we have a good story for cplus-plus of as</p>
      <p begin="00:53:52.400" end="00:53:56.350">far as the has the story for building...storyboards objective...</p>
      <p begin="00:53:56.350" end="00:54:01.520">concerned we don't have a great story there yet but we allow you to basically building</p>
      <p begin="00:54:01.520" end="00:54:06.700">objective see coherent bs as well...don't have like storybook integration stuff like that so</p>
      <p begin="00:54:06.700" end="00:54:12.100">you'll notice you'll notice here in this particular case that this is the cross-platform I</p>
      <p begin="00:54:12.100" end="00:54:16.790">was application project and it references the static library so this project</p>
      <p begin="00:54:16.790" end="00:54:21.260">right here takes to static library that was being built by the I</p>
      <p begin="00:54:21.260" end="00:54:25.280">was static library project and once...consumes that actually</p>
      <p begin="00:54:26.700" end="00:54:30.620">...the objective sequel which is right here in the app delegate dot m and the game and</p>
      <p begin="00:54:30.620" end="00:54:34.780">...you controlled out so on also you'll find here the main story</p>
      <p begin="00:54:34.780" end="00:54:40.230">...is here in this template so what we're really doing here is that we've already creeds project</p>
      <p begin="00:54:40.230" end="00:54:43.500">...particular case but if you have like a really heavy cc</p>
      <p begin="00:54:43.500" end="00:54:47.260">...application then you probably have very little, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:47.260" end="00:54:50.760">you have a ui container...open...surface perhaps and then</p>
      <p begin="00:54:50.760" end="00:54:55.840">the textiles component there so you guys can use...transfer now...again these are preview</p>
      <p begin="00:54:55.840" end="00:55:01.110">bets over the...will be working on preparing a story which is</p>
      <p begin="00:55:01.110" end="00:55:06.090">more robust and a complete story for ios but this is...line of thinking</p>
      <p begin="00:55:06.090" end="00:55:11.710">we still want you guys try this out and give us feedback because I will help us so I'm going to go and try</p>
      <p begin="00:55:11.710" end="00:55:16.600">...experience again one more time because I can show that properly in the meantime</p>
      <p begin="00:55:16.600" end="00:55:32.910">you guys have questions please keep them coming now so we're almost at the end of this so...</p>
      <p begin="00:55:32.910" end="00:55:36.380">Right so the question is if I want to be able to run this on a</p>
      <p begin="00:55:36.380" end="00:55:44.790">...server like build a my server.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:44.790" end="00:55:49.520">Right so the I think I think it's definitely possible I'm not sure like if it's legally</p>
      <p begin="00:55:49.520" end="00:55:54.320">possible I think some of the ios euler's don't allow us to be able to do that</p>
      <p begin="00:55:54.320" end="00:55:59.200">scenario but I could be wrong there but definitely I mean I don't have the answer from a perspective of like how much</p>
      <p begin="00:55:59.200" end="00:56:01.770">time do you need but as you can see that</p>
      <p begin="00:56:01.770" end="00:56:05.480">if I go ahead and build this code again you'll notice that it's actually really,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:05.480" end="00:56:12.090">really fast what I'm going to do this time is that since my screencast so notice actually hit</p>
      <p begin="00:56:12.090" end="00:56:15.980">debug...I...to show you...debugging experience again so,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:15.980" end="00:56:19.210">let me just try to minimize this parallels window and</p>
      <p begin="00:56:19.210" end="00:56:25.800">make sure my screencast is running correctly so?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:25.800" end="00:56:28.580">...I can either currently work on a parallels</p>
      <p begin="00:56:28.580" end="00:56:33.010">...or the other that sense so machines now</p>
      <p begin="00:56:33.010" end="00:56:38.590">...I'm good...the other questions you guys have.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:38.590" end="00:56:48.130">Someone sir.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:48.130" end="00:56:53.070">Right so yes, you can't do debugging yet but you can currently, currently</p>
      <p begin="00:56:53.070" end="00:56:59.180">as the...rc you can actually open up your jar source files and, them</p>
      <p begin="00:56:59.180" end="00:57:03.280">as text files but that is something that, you know, we're thinking about very</p>
      <p begin="00:57:03.280" end="00:57:08.170">...we haven't yet made them into the byproduct bits that but that's something that, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:08.170" end="00:57:16.190">...change in the upcoming releases are there are no question sorcery sr.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:16.190" end="00:57:22.790">So, the question is there a plan for the us editor for the...platform...you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:22.790" end="00:57:28.020">I think I think from a priority prospectively might look at java first and then a ui but,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:28.020" end="00:57:33.280">I mean I...say no here I mean a year-ago you know, we wouldn't even dream to have triangle of...tool to</p>
      <p begin="00:57:33.280" end="00:57:37.660">...a running inside visual studio in parallel the decrying without</p>
      <p begin="00:57:37.660" end="00:57:45.690">...own compiler until sets?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:45.690" end="00:57:48.540">This currently only...for ios the question is</p>
      <p begin="00:57:48.540" end="00:57:53.030">...this actually enablement work only for ios or does it work from mac os</p>
      <p begin="00:57:53.030" end="00:57:57.230">...so on it currently only...are preview bits again and we</p>
      <p begin="00:57:57.230" end="00:58:13.680">currently only support the developing for the ios platform?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:13.680" end="00:58:16.410">Right so the question is...we</p>
      <p begin="00:58:16.410" end="00:58:21.180">...api is...you guys can essentially use the as a platform...there is</p>
      <p begin="00:58:21.180" end="00:58:23.210">...the question so, yeah, so,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:23.210" end="00:58:29.050">currently in our story like how many...national examine your below</p>
      <p begin="00:58:29.050" end="00:58:31.610">...actually is a very popular solution these days</p>
      <p begin="00:58:31.610" end="00:58:36.480">...providing a platforms bachelor and csharp right we are approach is</p>
      <p begin="00:58:36.480" end="00:58:41.720">...different...we provide is the ability since...apple's is actually...all these platforms</p>
      <p begin="00:58:41.720" end="00:58:45.900">...the ability to target and use that tool chain but we don't necessarily</p>
      <p begin="00:58:45.900" end="00:58:50.330">...the ability to be able to.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:50.330" end="00:58:53.420">You know, to be able to use a platform...there so,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:53.420" end="00:58:56.960">that's basically so we target the we use the clang and dk tool</p>
      <p begin="00:58:56.960" end="00:59:03.530">chain that android provides of...tools...provides the use the x code</p>
      <p begin="00:59:03.530" end="00:59:08.800">...and the and the...tool chain the apple kind...compiler that they provide and</p>
      <p begin="00:59:08.800" end="00:59:13.270">their set of api and that's basically our story for now so now the questions I</p>
      <p begin="00:59:13.270" end="00:59:14.540">...verse hands here.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:17.690" end="00:59:25.120">Yes, sir.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:25.120" end="00:59:29.640">Right so the question is can actually use the stuff that I</p>
      <p begin="00:59:29.640" end="00:59:32.950">demos to build the...plug-ins.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:32.950" end="00:59:37.680">The answer is that we currently haven'tbeing able to do that</p>
      <p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:40.750">it is something that people have asked us to do but we</p>
      <p begin="00:59:40.750" end="00:59:46.350">haven't yet been able to do that as...as a priorities a little bit different but if you guys feel so</p>
      <p begin="00:59:46.350" end="00:59:52.880">strongly about this you seem like a very interesting...talked to some please come and talked about this.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:52.880" end="01:00:02.160">Other questions...back somewhere there.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:02.160" end="01:00:12.520">So, I couldn't actually.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:12.520" end="01:00:17.470">Right so the question is that the cross-platform intelligence experience that I</p>
      <p begin="01:00:17.470" end="01:00:22.260">was lighting up there is that actually oper bull and does that does that</p>
      <p begin="01:00:22.260" end="01:00:27.720">actually work for even the different processor architectures like sixty-four</p>
      <p begin="01:00:27.720" end="01:00:31.980">...eighty-six is currently this features only support...platform level</p>
      <p begin="01:00:31.980" end="01:00:35.450">...but, it is not beyond relevant managing ability</p>
      <p begin="01:00:35.450" end="01:00:45.410">that that's notion be possible other questions they you guys have sorry yes sir?</p>
      <p begin="01:00:45.410" end="01:00:50.220">Right so the question is this plan come bundled digital studio absolutely so if you bring up the</p>
      <p begin="01:00:50.220" end="01:00:54.530">visual studio installer now and you go into the optional packages if you choose</p>
      <p begin="01:00:54.530" end="01:00:58.830">the cross-platform node you will see that there's an option there to install the android and</p>
      <p begin="01:00:58.830" end="01:01:01.600">...and once installed the error any k</p>
      <p begin="01:01:01.600" end="01:01:08.410">you basically install the clang of the and that comes inside the indicates...for targeting android.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:08.410" end="01:01:12.390">Other questions in the room.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:12.390" end="01:01:17.460">...just...quickly sugars debugging experience again sorry about that like keep switching away from this</p>
      <p begin="01:01:17.460" end="01:01:22.620">so notice like have the break one that I said my cube draw here whowas actually had and,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:22.620" end="01:01:27.210">I can actually, you know, it continue which will run my app as you</p>
      <p begin="01:01:27.210" end="01:01:31.380">can see the background I can actually run my apps frame by frame here you can see that as an</p>
      <p begin="01:01:31.380" end="01:01:36.560">hidden continue map is actually running frame by frame is basically debugging from the visual</p>
      <p begin="01:01:36.560" end="01:01:40.600">studio...your as application I can also set other break points here</p>
      <p begin="01:01:40.600" end="01:01:43.750">that actually get hit here we go.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:43.750" end="01:01:47.820">All the experiences that you guys are used today on the windows experience from debugging perspective</p>
      <p begin="01:01:47.820" end="01:01:50.970">...debugging locals autos of watch</p>
      <p begin="01:01:50.970" end="01:01:55.700">...window all of those things are supported in this particular case I have the rotation of</p>
      <p begin="01:01:55.700" end="01:01:59.290">variable here associated my watch window and notice that actually,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:59.290" end="01:02:04.350">you know, what between different passes as we go through the...in the cube draw</p>
      <p begin="01:02:04.350" end="01:02:08.250">...function here also the other windows I call stack break points all that kind</p>
      <p begin="01:02:08.250" end="01:02:12.670">of stuff that you guys today used to doing in the windows experience from a devoting perspective is actually a</p>
      <p begin="01:02:12.670" end="01:02:18.430">available for ios as well so we would love to hear feedback from you guys and ios and the</p>
      <p begin="01:02:18.430" end="01:02:20.610">...have to provide here?</p>
      <p begin="01:02:20.610" end="01:02:23.540">Without said I just have a few more slides and us keep</p>
      <p begin="01:02:23.540" end="01:02:31.030">questions coming so I know there's other people in the room that we're asking question-answer.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:31.030" end="01:02:35.760">There is currently not support for working...existing project...this is kind of like</p>
      <p begin="01:02:35.760" end="01:02:43.220">our preview bits you know, we've been working on this on this very hard you imagine building up</p>
      <p begin="01:02:43.220" end="01:02:47.690">remote intel's in imagine building and more buildings and all that but now that we've got that going</p>
      <p begin="01:02:47.690" end="01:02:52.870">...able to launch this for you guys and...works so as you guys can see those kind of</p>
