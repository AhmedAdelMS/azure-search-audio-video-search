      <p begin="00:00:06.720" end="00:00:08.210">All rights.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.210" end="00:00:12.060">Good afternoon everyone thank you for coming.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.060" end="00:00:16.440">So, I hope everyone's having a great day one and build twenty fifteen</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.440" end="00:00:21.600">my name is charles morris and this is...and we're both pm leads on</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.600" end="00:00:28.690">the microsoft edge team is so great to be able to say that out loud.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.690" end="00:00:33.680">we're here today to give you an introduction to microsoft edge new browser</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.680" end="00:00:40.070">the new web platform and the new foundation for web apps in windows ten.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.070" end="00:00:49.200">just a quick reminder to please fill...evaluation after the session let us know what you think.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.200" end="00:00:52.390">So, we have a lot to cover I think it's safe to say that this</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.390" end="00:00:57.240">is the biggest release for microsoft and the web for quite a long-time.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.240" end="00:00:58.560">And, we have a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.560" end="00:01:03.690">to cover luckily we have a lot of deep dive sessions to point you towards but,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.690" end="00:01:08.360">in the interest of saving time I'm actually going to start right now by combining an agenda</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.360" end="00:01:14.080">and architecture slide together I don't think I've ever seen this done before it's pretty amazing so,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.080" end="00:01:19.360">we're going to cover three main things the first thing is microsoft edge the browser</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.360" end="00:01:23.950">so...you through some of the design...through a tour of</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.950" end="00:01:30.710">features as well as some of the technical underpinnings for the browser.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.710" end="00:01:34.750">I'm going to talk about microsoft edge html which is a new</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.750" end="00:01:39.590">rendering engine that power's microsoft edge so I'll talk about the new focus</p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.590" end="00:01:45.930">for this engine as well as a bunch of...new features that are coming to this new web platform...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.930" end="00:01:50.840">html in addition to powering microsoft edge is also powering</p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.840" end="00:01:55.780">the new web out platform for windows ten so this is really a new approach</p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.780" end="00:02:01.270">a web apps that that's really going to be more friendly to web developers so how</p>
      <p begin="00:02:01.270" end="00:02:07.630">many of you out there build websites either for work or on your spare time?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.630" end="00:02:09.650">So, quite a few if you how many of you use</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.650" end="00:02:14.650">web-based technology in an app that's distributed through store.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.650" end="00:02:16.700">So, slightly smaller crowd how</p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.700" end="00:02:21.420">many of you use a browser to surf the internet</p>
      <p begin="00:02:21.420" end="00:02:25.520">okay sorry I need to get everyone to raise your hand at least one so,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:31.650">if you raise your hand and then they'll be something here for you.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.650" end="00:02:36.600">before getting into all of that I thought we should take a step back and really talk about context of why</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.600" end="00:02:41.570">this is such a big release and why microsoft decided to build a new browser</p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.570" end="00:02:44.250">and new platform at this time?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.250" end="00:02:48.470">But, more importantly then, you know, why we thought it was the right time I think it's important for us</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.470" end="00:02:52.670">to think about why you should care for both for yourself</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.670" end="00:02:56.150">as a developer as well as for your customers?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.150" end="00:02:58.130">And, to understand this we really need to take</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.130" end="00:03:03.060">...journey back about a year-ago when we started planning windows ten.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.060" end="00:03:07.720">...when we started planning windows ten we really started by saying we need to build</p>
      <p begin="00:03:07.720" end="00:03:11.670">a stronger connection with our customers web developers browser</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.670" end="00:03:16.660">enthusiasts so we need to start investing in building feedback channels and just participating</p>
      <p begin="00:03:16.660" end="00:03:21.430">in existing ones and we actually started a year-ago here build where</p>
      <p begin="00:03:21.430" end="00:03:26.380">...status dot modern dot...in beta and what this is a lot of you're</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.380" end="00:03:31.620">probably familiar with it but what it is a public roadmap so is our way of starting tell</p>
      <p begin="00:03:31.620" end="00:03:36.340">people here's what's in development here's what's under consideration so,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.340" end="00:03:41.110">that everyone knows what we're working on a month later we launched in open-source the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.110" end="00:03:45.900">site and since then we've been really updating and every month so people know exactly what we're working</p>
      <p begin="00:03:45.900" end="00:03:51.990">on but it wasn't enough to just tell you what we're working on we also needed to let you tell us</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.990" end="00:03:56.100">what you thought so we added a little vote...there which</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.100" end="00:04:00.620">linked software user voice site where all of you hopefully some of you have exhausted all of your</p>
      <p begin="00:04:00.620" end="00:04:08.050">twenty-five votes here to tell us what you want to see next in the web platform?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:08.050" end="00:04:12.750">But, of course it's a lot it's about a lot more than features right we want to hear what you had</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.750" end="00:04:17.010">to say so we start to get really active on twitter and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:17.010" end="00:04:21.910">we started holding these monthly ask ie sessions and for all of you speed readers you're seeing</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21.910" end="00:04:26.590">the people really did ask us all sorts of things and we did our best to actually</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.590" end="00:04:29.560">answers honestly as we could.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:29.560" end="00:04:34.020">And, since one hundred forty...is sometimes a little constraining we also did a reddit</p>
      <p begin="00:04:34.020" end="00:04:36.330">ame which was a lot of fun.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.820" end="00:04:42.580">But, beyond that we also want to broaden the reach of feedback beyond people who are on twitter</p>
      <p begin="00:04:42.580" end="00:04:48.380">or reddit and get feedback from our broad-base of customers in the way we did this was</p>
      <p begin="00:04:48.380" end="00:04:53.290">promoting the in product feedback so some of you notice that the smiley</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53.290" end="00:04:59.510">face in windows ten moved up to the top-level you why here it is an</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.510" end="00:05:04.130">ie because it launched their first but of course...forward into microsoft edge</p>
      <p begin="00:05:04.130" end="00:05:08.810">...what this allowed us to do is start to capture feedback really quickly from...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.810" end="00:05:11.420">Again, who don't go to these other places within just a couple</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.420" end="00:05:15.130">cliques they can start to tell us when things are going wrong or not working the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.130" end="00:05:22.830">way they expect and a little bit later on we'll start to see how we're using some of this data?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.830" end="00:05:24.710">So, when we took a step back and looked at</p>
      <p begin="00:05:24.710" end="00:05:32.720">all of that feedback that we were we were hearing we start to see a few key trends?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:32.720" end="00:05:35.180">So, to understand that I thought we could look at kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.180" end="00:05:41.630">...history of the web to talk about these three main things that we talk and we started to see.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:41.630" end="00:05:47.150">The first one was that the technology underpinning the web has really evolved a</p>
      <p begin="00:05:47.150" end="00:05:50.480">So, early on you can see the web spin around for</p>
      <p begin="00:05:50.480" end="00:05:54.790">a over twenty five years as of last year...celebrated his twenty fifth anniversary</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56.180" end="00:06:00.510">...older than some of you in the audience I'm not sure.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.510" end="00:06:04.100">And,...has been around for most that time.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.100" end="00:06:08.400">So, we had kind of the early portion of the web where things are crazy...like the wild west</p>
      <p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:11.330">...revolving really quickly lots new technologies lots</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.330" end="00:06:15.620">...versions ...in addition to new standards like html for</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.620" end="00:06:20.590">...css too because they were so many gap there's also a lot of proprietary technology so</p>
      <p begin="00:06:20.590" end="00:06:25.220">you started to see things like active-x or vp script via</p>
      <p begin="00:06:25.220" end="00:06:31.080">mel vector markup language starting to emerge that were not standards-based.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:31.080" end="00:06:35.500">And, this of course culminated with a ie six which was kind of the dominant browser</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.500" end="00:06:39.190">of the time and at the time people kind of thought that</p>
      <p begin="00:06:39.190" end="00:06:45.340">the web was maybe done like this we've checked that box we know-how to do the web.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.340" end="00:06:48.330">But, it turns out that the web actually has a lot more impact</p>
      <p begin="00:06:48.330" end="00:06:52.770">...that I think really what makes it unique is the enormous reach and diversity so the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:52.770" end="00:06:57.750">way that the web gets to everyone regardless of the os device is</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57.750" end="00:07:01.100">really by serving this enormous diversity of clients?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:02.250" end="00:07:05.860">And, that really started to re-re emerge.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.860" end="00:07:09.340">Through kind of this transition phase of the web...fire faq started</p>
      <p begin="00:07:09.340" end="00:07:13.790">...up the competition again and with ie eight we really started to move back</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.790" end="00:07:18.150">...the standards-based approach.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.150" end="00:07:19.730">And, then finally we've moved and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:19.730" end="00:07:24.360">...last year's the pace of innovation is kind of pick back up with html five</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.360" end="00:07:29.240">so forth so the main message we heard here from our customers was okay things have</p>
      <p begin="00:07:29.240" end="00:07:34.330">changed a lot we have we really want to move forward and leave a lot of these</p>
      <p begin="00:07:34.330" end="00:07:37.630">ie proprietary technologies behind and yet we</p>
      <p begin="00:07:37.630" end="00:07:43.140">also had these customers on the other end of the spectrum they said hey I have a site that needs active-x or</p>
      <p begin="00:07:43.140" end="00:07:47.100">...phoebe script...just need those continue working in fact</p>
      <p begin="00:07:47.100" end="00:07:51.880">whenever you upgrade it would be really great if you stop breaking that.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:51.880" end="00:07:57.340">So, we had kind of this tension happening that we needed to deal with so that's the first thing we</p>
      <p begin="00:07:57.340" end="00:07:58.830">heard.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:58.830" end="00:08:00.770">The second thing we heard was,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:00.770" end="00:08:05.130">you know,...really strong competitors emerging so fire</p>
      <p begin="00:08:05.130" end="00:08:09.280">fox's I mentioned earlier safari especially on mobile and then</p>
      <p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:12.330">more recently chrome on the pc as well as mobile.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:13.450" end="00:08:17.490">And, by providing a per powerful platform great market share and great user</p>
      <p begin="00:08:17.490" end="00:08:23.570">experiences these are starting to really in some cases become quite dominant so</p>
      <p begin="00:08:23.570" end="00:08:28.550">we started hearing from developers especially was hey we've seen this story before we need to make</p>
      <p begin="00:08:28.550" end="00:08:33.550">sure we really need microsoft a competitive and making sure that the web</p>
      <p begin="00:08:33.550" end="00:08:37.300">continues to thrive on the basis of having multiple</p>
      <p begin="00:08:37.300" end="00:08:43.030">in independent implementations kind of this balance that's driving the web forward.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:43.030" end="00:08:46.730">So, that was the second thing the third thing we heard was</p>
      <p begin="00:08:46.730" end="00:08:51.740">apps so all of you probably see deal with this it's part of why you're here</p>
      <p begin="00:08:51.740" end="00:08:56.180">so there was this emergence of the app store and all of the probably seen surveys where you're</p>
      <p begin="00:08:56.180" end="00:09:01.170">seeing people spend less time and browsers and more time and apps and yet for a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:09:01.170" end="00:09:04.420">of developers especially those that were used to the web there was some conflict</p>
      <p begin="00:09:04.420" end="00:09:09.260">there cycle ki want to go where my users are going and I want to provide them with richer</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.260" end="00:09:14.820">experiences and yet I don't want to lose what's great about the web...love being able</p>
      <p begin="00:09:14.820" end="00:09:19.140">to deploy and push updates like that I love to cross platform</p>
      <p begin="00:09:19.140" end="00:09:23.870">nature of the web so that I don't have to rebuild things over and over again.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:23.870" end="00:09:26.160">So, this was a third thing that we heard in really cause</p>
      <p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:32.590">us to rethink how we bring web apps into windows ten?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:32.590" end="00:09:37.440">So, taken altogether this is really what caused us to</p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:42.260">realize that we need to do more than...produce the next version of the browser we</p>
      <p begin="00:09:42.260" end="00:09:47.090">...we needed...fundamental shifts in the way we do things and this is</p>
      <p begin="00:09:47.090" end="00:09:50.490">what led to not just...browser with it, you know, and,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:50.490" end="00:09:54.430">fresh coat of paint not just swapping out the engine not just a</p>
      <p begin="00:09:54.430" end="00:10:09.440">new about platform but really all three of those things so without I'm going to handed off to...</p>
      <p begin="00:10:09.440" end="00:10:13.040">Yeah, so, along with the changes in the web</p>
      <p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:17.600">and the web technology web standards the actual world around which the browsers</p>
      <p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:22.310">bills also been change of the last twenty years and we have been</p>
      <p begin="00:10:22.310" end="00:10:27.110">...improving the browser over time but there's a very fundamental ways of things are changing</p>
      <p begin="00:10:27.110" end="00:10:31.970">particularly windows ten some of those really take a step function complexity, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:31.970" end="00:10:35.540">we've moved from,... a single form factor ninety-five, you know,</p>

      <p begin="00:11:00.630" end="00:11:05.470">have to think about what do we have a browser platform the way that we're building a browser the way that we</p>

      <p begin="00:11:11.260" end="00:11:13.650">Also change expectations from users,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:13.650" end="00:11:17.420">for example, this idea of a mobility of experience which is instead of</p>

      <p begin="00:13:47.510" end="00:13:51.730">we need to go beyond sort of the code of panes and beyond simply changing the engine</p>

      <p begin="00:14:36.870" end="00:14:41.350">we said we're going to be bowls...forward-looking and that sort of meant as we'll talk about</p>
      <p begin="00:14:41.350" end="00:14:45.190">...some of the things that we took for granted as we've been developing</p>
      <p begin="00:14:45.190" end="00:14:50.130">sort and explore over the years and iterate...some of those things we took for granted like we had</p>
      <p begin="00:14:50.130" end="00:14:54.500">to maintain support for certain types of extensibility, for example, we were going to take that</p>
      <p begin="00:14:54.500" end="00:14:59.640">step function away because the environment in which we we're operating meant that those things</p>

      <p begin="00:15:06.920" end="00:15:13.070">as reliable as we needed to be and the third thing and this is sort of aligns with the windows ten overall windows</p>
      <p begin="00:15:13.070" end="00:15:16.720">a service is we decided we were going to ship fast trying new things and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:16.720" end="00:15:20.460">...always get better so we started last year with, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:20.460" end="00:15:24.280">shipping developer previews as part of an underneath under ieee</p>

      <p begin="00:15:33.740" end="00:15:38.840">Because rethought...the interaction might not work we get too many too much feedback people just</p>
      <p begin="00:15:38.840" end="00:15:41.560">telling us to product...something like that so we,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:41.560" end="00:15:47.100">you know, we still get that feedback but, actually it turns out a ton of people are out there really passion they</p>
      <p begin="00:15:47.100" end="00:15:51.320">want the party better and they give us really amazing honest feedback so,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:51.320" end="00:15:57.950">these are the kinds of things these...of attendance that we held close as we approach the...rebuilding.</p>

      <p begin="00:16:04.610" end="00:16:12.130">would improve the product over time with these sort of principles of mine so coming back to?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:12.130" end="00:16:18.700">What we're...actually shipping this summer we decided to focus on?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:18.700" end="00:16:23.600">Three sort of core areas in the products aside from sort of core...the products in the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:23.600" end="00:16:28.530">way reengineering...areas we decide we want to try to put a stake in the ground and do something</p>
      <p begin="00:16:28.530" end="00:16:32.450">different and differentiating with the first-round core...</p>
      <p begin="00:16:32.450" end="00:16:37.420">visual assistant that's built into windows ten comes from windows phone we decide really</p>
      <p begin="00:16:37.420" end="00:16:42.330">think about how we could improve browsing with this idea that I have a personal system that</p>
      <p begin="00:16:42.330" end="00:16:47.350">...sort of help me accomplish the tasks them doing on the web the second is around reading a</p>
      <p begin="00:16:47.350" end="00:16:50.970">...the most common activities that we're doing on the web probably the single all reading,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:50.970" end="00:16:56.690">reading lots of things that people are reading long form the really short form?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:56.690" end="00:17:01.420">They're doing a lot of consumption of content on the web as we decided we're going to try to make that better</p>
      <p begin="00:17:01.420" end="00:17:06.400">as we have a couple features that we've done this released and we're going to do more and more time to really</p>
      <p begin="00:17:06.400" end="00:17:11.780">try to nail that course scenario of people reading on the web and the third thing is around</p>
      <p begin="00:17:11.780" end="00:17:16.250">note-taking so we've seen this idea of people annotating mean creation sharing</p>
      <p begin="00:17:17.990" end="00:17:22.770">this idea of doing research on the web this is something we seen over and over again as a core pattern</p>
      <p begin="00:17:22.770" end="00:17:27.440">of what people are doing on the web...as the integrated the web since their lives and sort of becomes</p>
      <p begin="00:17:27.440" end="00:17:31.010">...part of what they do and we said we're going to try to do some things in that space</p>
      <p begin="00:17:31.010" end="00:17:34.800">really make that easier you'll see some of this the work that we've done in our first</p>
      <p begin="00:17:34.800" end="00:17:45.780">released this summer and will do more and more of that over time so we do a quick demo what we've done?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:45.780" end="00:17:50.430">Ok, so, here we are and I'm going...startup.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:50.430" end="00:17:55.150">Is almost said project...are microsoft edge I will say that at least ten times</p>

      <p begin="00:18:49.560" end="00:18:54.780">something we're really nail those core tasks the people are cut want to accomplish they want to go to particular site they want</p>

      <p begin="00:22:49.510" end="00:22:55.290">...this experience is something that we are expanding over time we have a think</p>
      <p begin="00:22:55.290" end="00:22:57.090">about forty thousand restaurants in right now we're</p>
      <p begin="00:22:57.090" end="00:23:00.760">...expand over the next few months to majority</p>
      <p begin="00:23:00.760" end="00:23:05.820">restaurants united states and then over time torestaurants around the world and,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:05.820" end="00:23:09.600">then we will also be adding different scenarios and...new scenarios</p>
      <p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:14.230">...talk about towards the end of bringing in this idea that, you know, based on the context of what I'm doing the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:14.230" end="00:23:19.370">browsing make personal cystic...help me find what I'm looking for.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:19.370" end="00:23:21.700">And, the final thing that we sort of have is, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:21.700" end="00:23:26.780">this very simple idea that well I could always ask...what?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:26.780" end="00:23:31.660">About something so I click on south lake union here I don't know where it is it gives me a little map and we have like twenty or</p>
      <p begin="00:23:31.660" end="00:23:35.390">thirty different entities that we support here whether it's if it's a food that is used in</p>

      <p begin="00:23:52.160" end="00:23:55.380">So, this is the idea that we had is this idea...have this course...</p>
      <p begin="00:23:55.380" end="00:24:03.330">assistant she's available to help me find out all of my brad pitt related information all times.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:03.330" end="00:24:04.570">Okay,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:04.570" end="00:24:09.340">the second thing that we can work...I said is reading so we started by this idea of a reading</p>
      <p begin="00:24:09.340" end="00:24:15.420">lists reading is an interesting scenario so derives from ...dries from favorites...of</p>
      <p begin="00:24:15.420" end="00:24:20.230">...use favors to just keep track of things they want to read later we had this idea that we would come up with</p>
      <p begin="00:24:20.230" end="00:24:24.940">the reading list you could add things explicitly reading list...more beautiful view of them is organized</p>
      <p begin="00:24:24.940" end="00:24:31.730">in reverse order by the things you put in when you click on can take...the site and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:31.730" end="00:24:36.410">you can easily remove it and say that I'm done with this with reading this article so it's really</p>
      <p begin="00:24:36.410" end="00:24:41.560">optimize around this idea want to put something away and read it a later time?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:41.560" end="00:24:44.650">When you come to the article the other thing that we did was work on this</p>
      <p begin="00:24:44.650" end="00:24:49.880">to distraction free are reading view which is where we take the contents on the page we have</p>
      <p begin="00:24:49.880" end="00:24:53.840">...heuristics pull out the content the core images are reconstruct the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:53.840" end="00:24:59.090">pages something this formal readable and far more interesting to you instead of the distractions</p>
      <p begin="00:24:59.090" end="00:25:03.350">...might be on the page so this is sort of the first couple things we've done around reading</p>
      <p begin="00:25:03.350" end="00:25:09.000">level feedback on them and then we'll work on more in the future</p>
      <p begin="00:25:09.000" end="00:25:12.610">so the second a third thing we did is run annotations there's going to show</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.610" end="00:25:20.640">you very quickly invites apple the annotation button I can sort of say?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:26.980">You know.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:26.980" end="00:25:31.650">Right so this is something I can do I can write...directly on the page and then I can sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:25:31.650" end="00:25:37.810">clip this and I don't know brad pitts suing over on the side there</p>
      <p begin="00:25:37.810" end="00:25:47.700">...let-me know...reminded me of brad is never far from my mind?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:47.700" end="00:25:49.080">And, expect this if you.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:51.540" end="00:25:55.620">I can clip this that I can share with my wife ...you have...moi.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:58.250" end="00:25:59.920">See will never see this.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:01.640" end="00:26:05.980">...clip this...share this image and I can make annotations is very,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:05.980" end="00:26:11.440">... we've seen this logical use...scenario different ways they see something on amazon they want a annotated</p>
      <p begin="00:26:11.440" end="00:26:16.150">...send it to somebody and it's not just...you can user finger also have</p>
      <p begin="00:26:16.150" end="00:26:28.060">a if you have a touch-screen you could out you can you attacks annotation as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.060" end="00:26:34.820">you know, you can share this as well so I'm...quit out of that and hope it was deleted okay, so,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:34.820" end="00:26:39.330">that's the core features core...reading annotation these are</p>
      <p begin="00:26:39.330" end="00:26:45.210">sort of three areas that we try to create some interesting and differentiating scenarios around and, really you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:45.210" end="00:26:54.460">try the product and let us know...think ...switch back to.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:54.460" end="00:26:58.440">So, in addition to that.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:58.440" end="00:27:03.270">We want to talk about what microsoft edge is as an app it's built for</p>
      <p begin="00:27:03.270" end="00:27:08.320">windows ten and we'll talk about why that's important why that's interesting is built</p>
      <p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:13.520">...universal windows platform which allows us to actually work across all of these devices over time</p>
      <p begin="00:27:13.520" end="00:27:18.290">we have to design different you why because that is part of which want to do is make sure the core of the app</p>
      <p begin="00:27:18.290" end="00:27:24.520">...goes across for devices but you created a user experiences tailored for each device and,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:24.520" end="00:27:29.500">it's updated frequently along with windows ten is also ready for the future and that senses I</p>
      <p begin="00:27:29.500" end="00:27:32.910">mention briefly before it does also mean that we've left behind some</p>
      <p begin="00:27:32.910" end="00:27:37.680">of the technologies that kind of brabeen part of the ideal history</p>
      <p begin="00:27:37.680" end="00:27:41.900">...this point active-x controls aren't supported and we do support flashing</p>
      <p begin="00:27:41.900" end="00:27:45.580">...natively as part of project spartan but,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:45.580" end="00:27:51.020">active-x is not supported tool bar's ba chose variety of technologies like that which...no longer sport</p>
      <p begin="00:27:51.020" end="00:27:57.130">...script are supported anymore so...a long...list?</p>
      <p begin="00:27:57.130" end="00:28:00.250">You must not working...</p>
      <p begin="00:28:00.250" end="00:28:05.080">So, for our friends and...who do have a large a lot of line-of-business applications</p>
      <p begin="00:28:05.080" end="00:28:09.050">ado requires technologies ie eleven mostly untouched redone course</p>
      <p begin="00:28:09.050" end="00:28:12.990">...work on it is part of the product and...you as</p>
      <p begin="00:28:12.990" end="00:28:19.550">a it administrator will be able to deploy you know, the ...list so that you</p>
      <p begin="00:28:19.550" end="00:28:24.890">either, you know, you actually deploy eleven as the default if that's works for your environment because you have</p>
      <p begin="00:28:24.890" end="00:28:29.550">that many systems that require or you can access or periodically, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:29.550" end="00:28:31.250">launch over to ...explore,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:31.250" end="00:28:35.910">for example, we at work we still have...app the requires some active-x controls so whenever I go to the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:35.910" end="00:28:42.800">expense up it pops out and ie I do the expenses and I close and I go back into microsoft edge.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:42.800" end="00:28:45.170">And, also we take advantage of a lot of security features</p>
      <p begin="00:28:45.170" end="00:28:48.960">...sixty four-bit by default which is something we actually been trying to do for a long-time</p>
      <p begin="00:28:48.960" end="00:28:53.950">actually been held back because most extensibility has been three two-bit up...point and,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:53.950" end="00:28:58.770">we use app containers which is a...technology for as</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58.770" end="00:29:03.160">part of windows ten so these are some of the things that we're sort of built on answer</p>
      <p begin="00:29:03.160" end="00:29:06.750">...grad for windows ten now one of the things you might be sort of wondering</p>
      <p begin="00:29:06.750" end="00:29:10.120">is will windows ten were all these, you know, down level</p>
      <p begin="00:29:10.120" end="00:29:14.800">platforms so as you heard this morning one of our goals is to make sure that windows</p>
      <p begin="00:29:14.800" end="00:29:19.820">...as may devices possible over the past couple years we've upgraded six</p>
      <p begin="00:29:19.820" end="00:29:23.760">hundred fifty million windows seven pc's to spone to get the ready for that</p>
      <p begin="00:29:23.760" end="00:29:27.840">operate windows ten we've upgraded to hundred-million plus windows ax</p>
      <p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:33.910">...to the latest us update of windows eight-point one to get the ready for that</p>
      <p begin="00:29:33.910" end="00:29:38.180">windows...upgrade we have all windows phone devices we have xbox devices and we have new</p>
      <p begin="00:29:38.180" end="00:29:39.880">pc's that we coming out over the next</p>
      <p begin="00:29:39.880" end="00:29:45.300">year the running windows ten so this number sounds a little large.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:45.300" end="00:29:48.550">But, there's a real active plan in place to try to try to get</p>
      <p begin="00:29:48.550" end="00:29:52.060">as many existing users on to windows ten and,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:52.060" end="00:29:58.200">all the different devices the different ...on with ten so...the you the based on which microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.200" end="00:30:02.690">edge will be running will actually be huge in a very short amount of time and,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:02.690" end="00:30:06.900">this course is the default browser on the desktop...of browser on</p>
      <p begin="00:30:06.900" end="00:30:12.720">peat on the phone as well and it's available on the other devices that we've talked about so that's a bit</p>
      <p begin="00:30:12.720" end="00:30:19.410">about the app hanover talk a little bit about html...pictures of.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:19.410" end="00:30:20.740">So, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:20.740" end="00:30:25.640">I mean I'll start out again by apologizing advances going to be a sharp</p>
      <p begin="00:30:25.640" end="00:30:32.060">decrease in brad pitt related content for the next little while sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:32.060" end="00:30:36.800">...so, that's good for some people apparently.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:36.800" end="00:30:41.580">So, I'm going to talk about microsoft edge html which is the new rendering engine that</p>
      <p begin="00:30:41.580" end="00:30:45.280">powers microsoft edge so I talked a little bit earlier about</p>
      <p begin="00:30:45.280" end="00:30:49.060">some of the broad trends that we were seeing across web what we were hearing from</p>
      <p begin="00:30:49.060" end="00:30:55.340">our customers and what we ended up doing last may actually was we?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:55.340" end="00:31:00.700">Formed are platform priorities and we really rallied around this single statement that we</p>
      <p begin="00:31:00.700" end="00:31:05.410">published on our blog last may and statement was really simple the web should</p>
      <p begin="00:31:05.410" end="00:31:10.380">just work for everyone users developers and businesses</p>
      <p begin="00:31:10.380" end="00:31:16.040">and this was a reflection of what we were hearing and seeing from people was that this kind of fundamental promise</p>
      <p begin="00:31:16.040" end="00:31:24.150">of the web wasn't actually working as promised so let me show you a quick example of what we're seeing.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:24.150" end="00:31:27.280">So, in general, you know, this is the web that were used to right you've got</p>
      <p begin="00:31:27.280" end="00:31:31.230">...works great works the same across a bunch</p>
      <p begin="00:31:31.230" end="00:31:37.490">of different browsers and this is the web that you know, that this is what the web promises.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:37.490" end="00:31:39.170">So, we're good write.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:39.170" end="00:31:42.080">Well, actually it turns out that we weren't seeing that all</p>
      <p begin="00:31:42.080" end="00:31:45.080">over the place on an increasing number of sites we</p>
      <p begin="00:31:45.080" end="00:31:49.970">started to see situations more like this especially where the sites were adopting</p>
      <p begin="00:31:49.970" end="00:31:54.410">more modern technologies things that were perhaps only available in one browser so this</p>
      <p begin="00:31:54.410" end="00:31:59.310">is very prevalent on the mobile web so you had a certain browser that was,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:59.310" end="00:31:59.820">you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:59.820" end="00:32:04.590">through no-fault...for through no fault of its own actually racing ahead providing new capabilities to</p>
      <p begin="00:32:04.590" end="00:32:08.910">developers providing the market share and developers were getting excited in building</p>
      <p begin="00:32:08.910" end="00:32:15.030">...for it so this was kind of, you know, harking back to the isis days and</p>
      <p begin="00:32:15.030" end="00:32:18.040">although pushes the web forward it also takes away from some that</p>
      <p begin="00:32:18.040" end="00:32:22.730">...diversity that I talked about earlier that's really the fundamental value of the web so</p>
      <p begin="00:32:22.730" end="00:32:30.270">we really wanted to bring that tenet of the web just works back to the modern web.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:30.270" end="00:32:35.670">So, we were faced with kind of this question of how do we start to push forward and fix a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:32:35.670" end="00:32:39.230">of these interoperability issues that we were seeing that were causing these things on</p>
      <p begin="00:32:39.230" end="00:32:43.310">the modern web as well as continuing to make our customers</p>
      <p begin="00:32:43.310" end="00:32:47.970">happy that had a lot of dependencies on ie proprietary technology and just one</p>
      <p begin="00:32:47.970" end="00:32:54.230">of those sites written in the year two thousand so to just keep on working.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:54.230" end="00:32:56.380">And, that's what led us to not just a break from</p>
      <p begin="00:32:56.380" end="00:33:00.220">the past but a fork from the past so we actually</p>
      <p begin="00:33:00.220" end="00:33:06.820">forks the ie engine microsoft html and created a new engine that were calling at</p>
      <p begin="00:33:06.820" end="00:33:09.840">And, the reason we did that was to really free ourselves</p>
      <p begin="00:33:09.840" end="00:33:14.800">from the compatibility burden so we can now leave that engine in</p>
      <p begin="00:33:14.800" end="00:33:20.110">place for compatibility and we now have this new engine that could be hundred-percent focused on</p>
      <p begin="00:33:20.110" end="00:33:27.690">interoperability so let's take a look at how that works so this was kind of the old story in I we had</p>
      <p begin="00:33:27.690" end="00:33:29.300">the one engine.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:29.300" end="00:33:34.210">And, we said hey we're going to deliver everything in this one place we're going to deliver the latest</p>
      <p begin="00:33:34.210" end="00:33:38.960">html five standard and by the way that site you wrote that requires</p>
      <p begin="00:33:38.960" end="00:33:44.380">phoebe script and active-x and all that other stuff is going to continue to work.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:44.380" end="00:33:49.510">part of the way we did that was by implementing...we call document mods so</p>
      <p begin="00:33:49.510" end="00:33:53.630">...been out for many years and I still run across people who have been developed developing for</p>
      <p begin="00:33:53.630" end="00:33:58.600">...and still don't quite understand them and it turned out they were they were pretty confusing</p>
      <p begin="00:33:58.600" end="00:34:05.580">because you had one browser that can now behave in a bunch of different ways depending on what...it was in.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:05.580" end="00:34:10.260">And, again, we try to say hey uses browser whether you're browsing the latest html five</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.260" end="00:34:15.379">sight or on your internet a or enterprise mode site.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:15.379" end="00:34:18.619">So, now with forking the engine what we were able to do is</p>
      <p begin="00:34:18.619" end="00:34:22.029">take that engine and give it a really clear purpose.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:23.249" end="00:34:27.799">So, now in windows ten microsoft html has a very clear purposes, purposes to be</p>
      <p begin="00:34:27.799" end="00:34:32.759">backwards compatible in fact since we're not really touching it other than security fixes as</p>
      <p begin="00:34:32.759" end="00:34:37.279">...mentioned we can now tell our customers with much higher degree of confidence that this</p>
      <p begin="00:34:37.279" end="00:34:41.599">thing's going to continue to work as it did before so continues</p>
      <p begin="00:34:41.599" end="00:34:46.299">to support the same technologies as it always does always did</p>
      <p begin="00:34:46.299" end="00:34:48.899">but now has a very focused</p>
      <p begin="00:34:48.899" end="00:34:53.139">purpose for mostly for enterprise and internet sites as well</p>
      <p begin="00:34:53.139" end="00:35:00.450">certain regions around the world like korea that have a big dependency on active-x.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:00.450" end="00:35:03.950">And, allows us to introduces new browser new rendering</p>
      <p begin="00:35:03.950" end="00:35:07.990">engine say for the vast majority of users that don't have a dependency on</p>
      <p begin="00:35:07.990" end="00:35:12.850">all these technologies then here's the browser we expect like I said the vast</p>
      <p begin="00:35:12.850" end="00:35:19.470">majority of windows ten users to be on microsoft edge so once we made that split it really</p>
      <p begin="00:35:19.470" end="00:35:24.440">...to start piling a bunch of interoperability improvements ripping out all</p>
      <p begin="00:35:24.440" end="00:35:28.470">of that ie specific stuff and fixing a lot of the differences</p>
      <p begin="00:35:28.470" end="00:35:34.500">are gaps between microsoft edge in other modern browsers.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:34.500" end="00:35:35.750">In fact.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:35.750" end="00:35:38.320">In microsoft edge...over forty two hundred</p>
      <p begin="00:35:38.320" end="00:35:41.910">...ability improvements on top of</p>
      <p begin="00:35:41.910" end="00:35:47.470">I eleven and as you can see.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:47.470" end="00:35:52.770">They're still they're still trickling in as we speak.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:52.770" end="00:36:00.030">the animation as waiting for this is actually hooked up directly into our source code system and.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:00.030" end="00:36:05.180">how do we know that this is actually working so I took you through the scenario before?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:05.180" end="00:36:09.550">...different experience across different devices now with edge you actually see</p>
      <p begin="00:36:09.550" end="00:36:13.640">the same the same experience is a combination of a</p>
      <p begin="00:36:13.640" end="00:36:17.960">new user agent string of course but also interoperability improvements so that we</p>
      <p begin="00:36:17.960" end="00:36:24.180">...same there's no doubt no changes required from the website in this case.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:24.180" end="00:36:27.130">But, of course we can't just say here's one or two or three or</p>
      <p begin="00:36:27.130" end="00:36:30.100">...ten-hour hundred sites that are now better we need to look</p>
      <p begin="00:36:30.100" end="00:36:34.040">...that the web is forty-some billion web</p>
      <p begin="00:36:34.040" end="00:36:34.540">websites.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:36.160" end="00:36:40.730">So, this is where we can really leverage the telemetry that I talked about earlier so I</p>
      <p begin="00:36:40.730" end="00:36:44.710">...through the smiley face and how it's really important for us to be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:36:44.710" end="00:36:49.820">enable people to give us feedback within just a couple clicks so here's an example of how</p>
      <p begin="00:36:49.820" end="00:36:53.670">we're using that feedback so this is telemetry that showing</p>
      <p begin="00:36:53.670" end="00:36:58.720">us how the number of reports that we get between the old engine and then you...so there</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:03.150">...a period of time over the last few months where they were both out there and actually if</p>
      <p begin="00:37:03.150" end="00:37:08.980">you installed windows ten you didn't know what engine you were going to get we actually had</p>
      <p begin="00:37:08.980" end="00:37:11.800">basically ab testing happening and you could go</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.800" end="00:37:16.650">...override if you wanted to but for the vast majority of our users they didn't know necessarily they were getting</p>
      <p begin="00:37:16.650" end="00:37:21.620">a new engine and what's not allowed us to do was compare the amount of feedback we were</p>
      <p begin="00:37:21.620" end="00:37:26.530">getting between each and tell us if we were doing better than the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:26.530" end="00:37:31.080">old engine and what you see here towards the left is that when we first released</p>
      <p begin="00:37:31.080" end="00:37:35.250">...new engine this is back in november we were actually doing worse and this</p>
      <p begin="00:37:35.250" end="00:37:39.720">...expected because we change the user agent string we got rid of all the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:39.720" end="00:37:44.520">ie specific tokens...we're really serious about rendering the same content</p>
      <p begin="00:37:44.520" end="00:37:48.420">is other browsers and yet so we're getting content that had no</p>
      <p begin="00:37:48.420" end="00:37:52.430">...specific work-arounds or anything and things are breaking because we didn't have</p>
      <p begin="00:37:52.430" end="00:37:58.420">all the interoperability fixes in yet and yet as you move towards the right you can see that as we release new</p>
      <p begin="00:37:58.420" end="00:38:03.170">...things start to get better and better and crossing over that dotted line was the point where</p>
      <p begin="00:38:03.170" end="00:38:08.200">we a few weeks ago start to see more positive feedback</p>
      <p begin="00:38:08.200" end="00:38:12.990">or I guess we could say less negative feedback for the new browser than we did for the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:12.990" end="00:38:17.420">for the old one and of course we're just going to continue fixing continue,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:17.420" end="00:38:25.070">continue checking in those...improvement so this is just going to continue going up?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:25.070" end="00:38:27.610">So, I talk a bunch about interoperability and making them web</p>
      <p begin="00:38:27.610" end="00:38:32.540">...work but of course we also want to push the leading edge of the web</p>
      <p begin="00:38:32.540" end="00:38:37.510">content pun sort of intended I guess leading edge of the web forward.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:37.510" end="00:38:40.950">So, we implemented a whole bunch of new features so this is a list directly</p>
      <p begin="00:38:40.950" end="00:38:45.300">...status dot...you can always get the latest list here of</p>
      <p begin="00:38:45.300" end="00:38:48.200">...so, this forty five so standards</p>
      <p begin="00:38:48.200" end="00:38:56.360">that are coming in development or in preview today in microsoft edge.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:56.360" end="00:38:58.000">So, that's all the time</p>
      <p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:03.040">have to cover right now on the platform there's a lot more detail to</p>
      <p begin="00:39:03.040" end="00:39:07.950">come actually feel kinda bad for not showing you any code in a platform session but</p>
      <p begin="00:39:07.950" end="00:39:13.040">thankfully there's a lot coming in the session so actually it's going to start tomorrow in the keynote</p>
      <p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:17.630">when david tread well and kevin gallagher going to give a demo of a new cite site</p>
      <p begin="00:39:17.630" end="00:39:22.710">arcade that combines a bunch of these new technologies together you also see some great</p>
      <p begin="00:39:22.710" end="00:39:26.690">...improvements that I had to try really hard not to</p>
      <p begin="00:39:26.690" end="00:39:31.900">tell you about today so that they can you can be surprised tomorrow as well as more about hosted web</p>
      <p begin="00:39:31.900" end="00:39:33.410">article talk about in a second?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:34.950" end="00:39:37.670">Next up you've got making your site rock with</p>
      <p begin="00:39:37.670" end="00:39:42.080">...twelve this actually happened a couple of hours ago so hopefully you caught it</p>
      <p begin="00:39:42.080" end="00:39:45.670">...not then you can see...talk online so</p>
      <p begin="00:39:45.670" end="00:39:49.350">...the rtwelve tools if you're familiar with them with ieee those are coming,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:49.350" end="00:39:53.300">coming over to microsoft edge and new improved version of</p>
      <p begin="00:39:53.300" end="00:39:59.680">...twelve will be the developer tooling for microsoft edge then we've got on friday we've got a couple</p>
      <p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:03.380">of sessions both of them will be super technical first rendering engine</p>
      <p begin="00:40:03.380" end="00:40:06.990">deep dive with david and david and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:06.990" end="00:40:12.070">lots of code lots of demos create session and then finally brian</p>
      <p begin="00:40:12.070" end="00:40:17.000">we'll be talking about building a fasten scalable apps with javascript</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.000" end="00:40:21.950">so on the previous slide you probably notice that there's a whole lot of ecma</p>
      <p begin="00:40:21.950" end="00:40:27.060">script six features on the slide so really happy that</p>
      <p begin="00:40:27.060" end="00:40:32.190">microsoft edge actually currently has the leading implementation of the next generation of</p>
      <p begin="00:40:32.190" end="00:40:34.290">javascript...</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.290" end="00:40:37.250">As measured by third-party site.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:37.250" end="00:40:38.970">So, if you're interested in learning more about</p>
      <p begin="00:40:38.970" end="00:40:43.630">that definitely check out brian's talk it's super technical</p>
      <p begin="00:40:43.630" end="00:40:50.600">also if you're if you're javascript coder and you want to geek out definitely don't miss that.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.600" end="00:40:55.010">All right so now we've got to move on to the third aspect which is web apps</p>
      <p begin="00:40:55.010" end="00:40:58.500">new about platform for windows ten.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:58.500" end="00:41:03.870">So, as I mentioned earlier web apps in general are big trend and</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03.870" end="00:41:09.650">we've really we've had a number of ways to include the web and apps over the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:09.650" end="00:41:14.070">past few releases so we've had things like hybrid apps web you controls as</p>
      <p begin="00:41:14.070" end="00:41:18.760">well as packaged apps where you could use html and write a bunch of code on the client.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:18.760" end="00:41:24.340">Instead of using example let's say in csharp but we felt like we really needed</p>
      <p begin="00:41:24.340" end="00:41:28.020">a new approach and the reason for this is really,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:28.020" end="00:41:33.350">really comes down to what terry talked about this morning in the keynote and that's</p>
      <p begin="00:41:33.350" end="00:41:38.000">really about providing a more natural bridge from the way all of these</p>
      <p begin="00:41:38.000" end="00:41:43.260">different platforms work into the universal windows platform so really providing</p>
      <p begin="00:41:43.260" end="00:41:50.100">...for people to bring their apps to windows in a more natural way.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:50.100" end="00:41:55.890">So, today I'm going to talk about give you a few more details about what that means for the web so what</p>
      <p begin="00:41:55.890" end="00:42:00.790">we're enabling that's new is what we call hosted web apps...I...talk just a little bit</p>
      <p begin="00:42:00.790" end="00:42:08.990">about how this is different from the other web app approaches we've delivered in the past.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:08.990" end="00:42:13.360">So, the first is that your website is really the foundation for your</p>
      <p begin="00:42:13.360" end="00:42:18.060">store app and what this means is that it's literally a url</p>
      <p begin="00:42:18.060" end="00:42:22.990">...put into a manifest and that gets published the store you don't have to download your side and</p>
      <p begin="00:42:22.990" end="00:42:27.770">...up locally you don't even have to put a web view control into your app this is</p>
      <p begin="00:42:27.770" end="00:42:33.060">not just about just a website wrapper?</p>
      <p begin="00:42:33.060" end="00:42:38.010">what really makes it not just a website wrapper is that you can augment</p>
      <p begin="00:42:38.010" end="00:42:41.360">the experience I said your...is the foundation and the reason</p>
      <p begin="00:42:41.360" end="00:42:45.240">is just the foundation is that you can now augment your site experience</p>
      <p begin="00:42:45.240" end="00:42:49.680">using the universal windows api so if there's anything that you need in the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:49.680" end="00:42:54.260">...in the windows api so let's say access to a device that's not part</p>
      <p begin="00:42:54.260" end="00:42:59.060">of the standards-based web platform you can now do that through the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:59.060" end="00:43:04.080">through javascript in the windows universal windows api?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:04.080" end="00:43:07.560">And, the best part of this is that there's no change</p>
      <p begin="00:43:07.560" end="00:43:11.800">...web workflow so again you might be thinking we've done this in the past, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:11.800" end="00:43:15.890">I have a web control and I know how to call from that out into local package</p>
      <p begin="00:43:15.890" end="00:43:21.690">...my app that is not would hosted web apps is all about it's really about</p>
      <p begin="00:43:21.690" end="00:43:26.570">having no change your web workload that means that the javascript code this call</p>
      <p begin="00:43:26.570" end="00:43:32.140">and the universal windows api is actually living on your server so when you need to deploy</p>
      <p begin="00:43:32.140" end="00:43:35.920">an update to that code you just do the same workflow that you always</p>
      <p begin="00:43:35.920" end="00:43:41.850">do hit deploy and all of your users...immediately updated.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:41.850" end="00:43:45.890">So, here's how could look in practice so here's an example of a simple</p>
      <p begin="00:43:45.890" end="00:43:49.130">website sample website that we've created so it's...it's</p>
      <p begin="00:43:49.130" end="00:43:52.430">...responsive website travel app and</p>
      <p begin="00:43:52.430" end="00:43:57.320">its functional as a website you can do to the basic scenarios here.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:57.320" end="00:43:59.340">However, we'd like to lighted up we'd like to</p>
      <p begin="00:43:59.340" end="00:44:06.170">augmented when it's installed as a hosted web app on windows ten.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:06.170" end="00:44:09.540">So, what we can do is just feature detect windows so in the</p>
      <p begin="00:44:09.540" end="00:44:14.690">same way that on the web...feature detect anyhtml five feature</p>
      <p begin="00:44:14.690" end="00:44:19.320">in javascript let's say because you're not sure if the browser that is hitting you is going to support</p>
      <p begin="00:44:19.320" end="00:44:24.310">it you feature detect windows again this code is living on your server so</p>
      <p begin="00:44:24.310" end="00:44:30.890">...say if windows then we can now call a windows specific api?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:30.890" end="00:44:35.520">And, once if your site is running in a...app context</p>
      <p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:39.970">then all of...your travel...augmented and start and put a</p>
      <p begin="00:44:39.970" end="00:44:44.580">calendar appointment directly into the users calendar so you can imagine if it's running as a</p>
      <p begin="00:44:44.580" end="00:44:49.170">website and you can use don't do this or you make them download and I cs file or</p>
      <p begin="00:44:49.170" end="00:44:53.340">something like that so this is a great example of augmenting the experience making sure they get</p>
      <p begin="00:44:53.340" end="00:45:00.190">a better more native feeling experience when they're your site is...app.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:00.190" end="00:45:03.290">So, again, the great thing about this is that you can deploy this code you</p>
      <p begin="00:45:03.290" end="00:45:12.550">can updates code immediately without having to go through any kind of app store approval process.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:12.550" end="00:45:17.420">So, in addition to hosted web apps for also improving other types of web app</p>
      <p begin="00:45:17.420" end="00:45:22.440">so again we know peopleuse more of a hybrid model where they've got a web you control</p>
      <p begin="00:45:22.440" end="00:45:26.990">also there's much improved way to call between</p>
      <p begin="00:45:26.990" end="00:45:31.000">...coding your control as well as coding your app using the ad web</p>
      <p begin="00:45:31.000" end="00:45:36.070">allowed objects so no more invoke script a sinking all that as well as some new api</p>
      <p begin="00:45:36.070" end="00:45:39.890">eyes and package web apps are getting a lot better one of the biggest</p>
      <p begin="00:45:39.890" end="00:45:44.040">kernels that we heard about that was the security restrictions so that's going to get a lot better</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.040" end="00:45:48.550">using the content security policy or csp the standard which allow you to</p>
      <p begin="00:45:48.550" end="00:45:54.260">basically white list domains that you want your app to be able to communicate with.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:54.260" end="00:45:59.460">So,...lot more their thank you get you get the message if you want to learn more about</p>
      <p begin="00:45:59.460" end="00:46:04.250">...apps then please check out jeff and carol session tomorrow at eleven thirty</p>
      <p begin="00:46:04.250" end="00:46:18.530">am where though go into a more detail and have a lot of demos encode?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:18.530" end="00:46:21.480">So, what we talked about as I mentioned earlier this is we</p>
      <p begin="00:46:21.480" end="00:46:27.410">really thinking about microsoft edge as something the revolving overtime...shown you talked about</p>
      <p begin="00:46:27.410" end="00:46:31.010">...stuff we're doing for our team released this summer we actually,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:31.010" end="00:46:36.820">you know,...you a service...to things that are coming after that kinda get you an idea of what we're focused on</p>
      <p begin="00:46:36.820" end="00:46:41.120">so the first actually was important that you should do is actually spent some time on status...modern</p>
      <p begin="00:46:41.120" end="00:46:46.060">...ieee...new url that will becoming you can redirect from there they'll</p>
      <p begin="00:46:46.060" end="00:46:50.660">get really this idea of what standards are coming into some really interesting standards like</p>
      <p begin="00:46:50.660" end="00:46:54.680">object rtc which is the next step of web rtc allowing</p>
      <p begin="00:46:54.680" end="00:46:59.380">...peer-to-peer communication between browsers soundscape scenarios,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:59.380" end="00:47:04.120">for example, and, poynter...which is really interesting one for gaming where you can</p>
      <p begin="00:47:04.120" end="00:47:09.780">lock the mouse pointer to the browser so that people can do first-person shooters,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:09.780" end="00:47:14.270">for example, so, these are...standards that are coming ...our tm and</p>
      <p begin="00:47:14.270" end="00:47:18.830">...keep track of how those are coming we'll have a previews that you can sort of see how these working</p>
      <p begin="00:47:18.830" end="00:47:24.010">after team the other thing that I'll just do a quick demo of</p>
      <p begin="00:47:24.010" end="00:47:30.030">...take some questions is extensions now this morning you saw?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:30.030" end="00:47:33.870">Geo talk about.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:33.870" end="00:47:39.160">Talk about extensions now...to make clear is x these extensions the work the surveys is</p>
      <p begin="00:47:39.160" end="00:47:44.190">a early code and will actually not be ready for...not...to have this extensibility</p>
      <p begin="00:47:44.190" end="00:47:48.940">...will come after or xhtml have previous people start working with</p>
      <p begin="00:47:48.940" end="00:47:53.270">after-hour tm and get a sense of over building but just give you a sense of that,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:53.270" end="00:47:58.860">you know,...you a couple demos one is the red example</p>
      <p begin="00:47:58.860" end="00:48:03.850">where we basically tookexisting extension built by the read enhancements</p>
      <p begin="00:48:03.850" end="00:48:08.060">...and open-source team...a group of engineers who just wanted to</p>
      <p begin="00:48:08.060" end="00:48:13.020">ads and features the reddit site the reddit and ceo of reddit one point said it was the, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:13.020" end="00:48:14.680">I love you guys actually it's</p>
      <p begin="00:48:14.680" end="00:48:18.260">...it's actually pretty interesting symbiotic relationship when talks these guys and we</p>
      <p begin="00:48:18.260" end="00:48:23.100">...got their code and we basically took that and we were able to bring it over to microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:48:23.100" end="00:48:27.540">edge almost unchanged so they basically has all the core functionality if you're</p>
      <p begin="00:48:27.540" end="00:48:32.220">ready user allow this functionality is you very familiar to you including things like</p>
      <p begin="00:48:32.220" end="00:48:38.040">the image preview inline previous that we have any click-through to the...of other features that</p>
      <p begin="00:48:38.040" end="00:48:43.490">...through ads and all those features are actually brought online without any changes</p>
      <p begin="00:48:43.490" end="00:48:47.350">any material changes from the original developer and</p>
      <p begin="00:48:47.350" end="00:48:51.290">...with the pinterest example that we showed no,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:51.290" end="00:48:56.130">this is the pinterest extension and, we actually again...for the pinterest and we got</p>
      <p begin="00:48:56.130" end="00:49:01.140">their code and we were able to bring it up with a very few changes to the to the to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:01.140" end="00:49:05.250">the extension itself so we're actually trying to support these html</p>
      <p begin="00:49:05.250" end="00:49:10.600">five javascript extensions that are sort of the standard on the web today and make it really,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:10.600" end="00:49:14.550">really easy to have extension today to bring over to project spartan one essentially</p>
      <p begin="00:49:14.550" end="00:49:22.720">he didn't show was...was some work that we actually did with our?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:22.720" end="00:49:29.700">Being translating where they wrote an extension for us that also happens...browsers.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:29.700" end="00:49:33.390">Eating this looks like an interesting site and you see the top in the address</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.390" end="00:49:38.250">...the pool icons as I can translate this side as well but...also have this reading view features so with</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38.250" end="00:49:42.910">a little bit of extra work this...take advantage of the fact...a review features well</p>

      <p begin="00:49:47.040" end="00:49:51.180">automatically the same time so I get this distraction free and actually readable for me</p>
      <p begin="00:49:51.180" end="00:49:56.700">sit on speak spanish version of this site so, you know, that's kind of what happened there is a</p>
      <p begin="00:49:56.700" end="00:50:00.390">detected unreviewed automatically translated that and that was something...kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:50:00.390" end="00:50:02.610">...we'd like to actually do with extensions as a</p>
      <p begin="00:50:02.610" end="00:50:07.530">...online as is have them do unique stuff with the features that we have in the browsers we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:50:07.530" end="00:50:11.850">make those things available for extension developers we have a few more we have a great</p>

      <p begin="00:50:21.420" end="00:50:26.730">...stables recent makes everything dim except the video digital we found it very easy</p>
      <p begin="00:50:26.730" end="00:50:31.900">to take the extensions from different developers kind of standing up in the browser so this is early work and</p>
      <p begin="00:50:31.900" end="00:50:38.490">...will becoming after...have a lot more information on the blogs for people to look into but just, you know,</p>

      <p begin="00:50:46.280" end="00:50:48.770">lighted up on spartan with new features.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:51.660" end="00:50:54.090">The other thing that you'll see is we're going to bring in more</p>
      <p begin="00:50:54.090" end="00:50:58.820">...features a few months ago we had the weather and...scenario will be brought</p>

      <p begin="00:51:58.220" end="00:52:03.750">...just you back.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:03.750" end="00:52:09.390">All right so, you know, as I started out by saying we started about a year-ago with</p>
      <p begin="00:52:09.390" end="00:52:14.210">this fundamental notion that we need to have a closer connection with developers</p>
      <p begin="00:52:14.210" end="00:52:19.510">and enthusiast basically all of you and that's not something that's going to stop so I</p>
      <p begin="00:52:19.510" end="00:52:24.370">...to just leave with...thought of please, you know,...treat microsoft edge in the platform</p>
      <p begin="00:52:24.370" end="00:52:28.750">...what platform as kind of this community thing and we want to make sure that</p>
      <p begin="00:52:28.750" end="00:52:31.260">it's more building what's what you</p>
      <p begin="00:52:31.260" end="00:52:36.960">want as a user as a developer so there's a bunch of resources here user voice</p>
      <p begin="00:52:36.960" end="00:52:41.910">status site that we talked about a lot of these urls are going to change in the very near future because of the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:41.910" end="00:52:46.700">...but, as sean said don't worry they're they will continue to</p>
      <p begin="00:52:46.700" end="00:52:49.830">...they will redirect to the right to the new homes</p>
      <p begin="00:52:49.830" end="00:52:53.570">also very active on twitter at ie dep chat which is also going to</p>
      <p begin="00:52:53.570" end="00:52:58.170">change the to add microsoft edge dev at any time now as well as</p>
      <p begin="00:52:58.170" end="00:53:03.460">...overflow and we're putting more and more of our samples and things</p>
      <p begin="00:53:03.460" end="00:53:08.900">on get hub the last thing I want to leave you with is if you want to know even more</p>
      <p begin="00:53:08.900" end="00:53:13.980">so I pointed at you at a bunch of scenario sessions here to learn more but</p>
      <p begin="00:53:13.980" end="00:53:19.360">next week we're actually having a full two-day event in mountain view just down the highway</p>
      <p begin="00:53:20.510" end="00:53:24.600">we're calling the microsoft edge web some it so this is going-to be to</p>

      <p begin="00:54:00.230" end="00:54:05.000">...the session yes so you probably google...can stay for hours for</p>
      <p begin="00:54:05.000" end="00:54:10.700">question so if you've got a question please step up to one of the mikes so,</p>

      <p begin="00:56:43.700" end="00:56:48.640">it going to be forty five days or ninety days or seventy three days or anything like that we haven't quite worked out</p>
      <p begin="00:56:48.640" end="00:56:52.600">...but, we have the technical ability to sort</p>
      <p begin="00:56:52.600" end="00:56:56.080">of updates are bring the entire user base along with us</p>

      <p begin="00:57:18.760" end="00:57:22.310">to get the get the latest and greatest opted twice a month</p>
      <p begin="00:57:22.310" end="00:57:28.270">...really two weeks basis in terms of how often we want to push</p>
      <p begin="00:57:28.270" end="00:57:34.750">those bits out to kind of the rest of our customers we're still figuring that out of...said.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:34.750" end="00:57:36.020">Thanks.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:36.020" end="00:57:37.000">There was somebody there.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:38.180" end="00:57:43.810">Is a free...over...well the weather...available...all of the platforms that windows</p>
      <p begin="00:57:43.810" end="00:57:48.060">ten supports the...xbox and holdings?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:48.060" end="00:57:51.410">Yes, absolutely yet so they're going to go into the universal store.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:52.770" end="00:57:57.520">the question was will the web apps be available...all windows ten platforms and the</p>
      <p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:01.740">answer's yes so especially if you have a great responsive web experience</p>
      <p begin="00:58:01.740" end="00:58:06.730">that's that scales across those different form factors and your...basically got a great</p>
      <p begin="00:58:06.730" end="00:58:11.620">headstart on a on app across all those devices so the only tradeoffs with</p>
      <p begin="00:58:11.620" end="00:58:16.060">that compared to like an native universe...might be some of the specific functionality like</p>
      <p begin="00:58:16.060" end="00:58:19.600">...tiles and other things like that right, yeah, but,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:19.600" end="00:58:24.550">actually with access to the universal windows api you can actually light up a lot of those</p>
      <p begin="00:58:24.550" end="00:58:28.650">that functionality now from your web app.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:28.650" end="00:58:34.300">What I'm that's...so I have two questions first one I know...</p>
      <p begin="00:58:34.300" end="00:58:36.170">it's a longer line but I apologize</p>
      <p begin="00:58:36.170" end="00:58:40.380">...first one with the it being able</p>
      <p begin="00:58:40.380" end="00:58:44.930">roll-out I a and setting that is amended is there</p>
      <p begin="00:58:44.930" end="00:58:49.560">any statement about being able to end-of-life and ie</p>
      <p begin="00:58:49.560" end="00:58:52.320">...when medal the?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:52.320" end="00:58:54.340">We haven't made any statements</p>
      <p begin="00:58:54.340" end="00:58:58.520">...guidance and we're working with customers definitely to help</p>
      <p begin="00:58:58.520" end="00:59:03.740">them migrate off of those technologies but we haven't set a marker in the future that's definitely the</p>
      <p begin="00:59:03.740" end="00:59:08.710">direction we're moving but we want to provided transition time to our customers to get off a</p>
      <p begin="00:59:08.710" end="00:59:13.420">lot of these all technologies we don't know exactly how long that's going to take at this point</p>
      <p begin="00:59:13.420" end="00:59:18.990">here so second question about the web apps is what about certification</p>
      <p begin="00:59:18.990" end="00:59:23.100">because if they're going into the store is there any sort of certification,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:23.100" end="00:59:28.370">yeah, that you have to go through and how does that work with doing updates and things like that, yeah, so,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:28.370" end="00:59:33.400">you'll be certified the first-time you go through just like any other update because</p>
      <p begin="00:59:33.400" end="00:59:38.240">subsequent updates basicallycircumvent the normal kind of packaged</p>
      <p begin="00:59:38.240" end="00:59:43.050">app review process that obviously doesn't work so we have a separate process</p>
      <p begin="00:59:43.050" end="00:59:48.080">...place where both just through kind of regular reviews of</p>
      <p begin="00:59:48.080" end="00:59:52.590">existing apps as well as of course monitoring feedback...and app gets a bunch of</p>
      <p begin="00:59:52.590" end="00:59:56.360">complains, for example,...we have a team of folks that will kind of regularly?</p>
      <p begin="00:59:57.430" end="01:00:00.750">Review apps...as there in-flight so to speak so if we</p>
      <p begin="01:00:00.750" end="01:00:07.130">...a bunch complaints and of course will take action and pull it down or do whatever?</p>
      <p begin="01:00:07.130" end="01:00:09.220">Okay, so, I think we're done with sort of the recorded</p>
      <p begin="01:00:09.220" end="01:00:14.560">questions come up here ask questions will be here thank you very much thank you.</p>
