      <p begin="00:00:05.210" end="00:00:09.430">alongside andy wilson I'm ben low-power and we're really excited we</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.430" end="00:00:13.200">know there's dozens and dozens of options for</p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.200" end="00:00:16.820">you the build viewing audience and andy and I we have</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.820" end="00:00:21.720">a goal today of making this I think everyone's favorite session...ferret</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.720" end="00:00:26.520">and what you have to let us now in the comments how we did if we lived up to the goal or not</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.520" end="00:00:30.470">...were excited to share this with you so this is a quick look</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.470" end="00:00:35.190">at our agenda we're going to talk about the perspective and how important</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.190" end="00:00:40.290">is to have perspective in different installations we're going to get right into</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.290" end="00:00:45.260">it with projection mapping I'm expecting that most of the people out there of heard of connect but we're</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.260" end="00:00:50.000">going to...we're going to spend sixty second super-high level on</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.000" end="00:00:53.900">connect we're also then going to talk about actually that point</p>
      <p begin="00:00:53.900" end="00:00:57.460">...going to start talking about some of his research and microsoft research</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.460" end="00:01:02.360">and projects maybe you've heard of them aluminum and room alive and we're going to get into it with the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:02.360" end="00:01:06.420">...live toolkit we're going to talk about rooms...calibration</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.420" end="00:01:10.120">great codes and also more on projection mapping</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.120" end="00:01:13.520">in a ton a demos we got a lot to get through so hold on to your</p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.520" end="00:01:18.390">...we're going to have some fun so let's talk a little bit about what we mean by hacking augmented</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.390" end="00:01:25.070">reality so maybe you've heard of a...microsoft announced back in january called the hollow</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.070" end="00:01:30.070">...we talked about...and these really amazing immersive things</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.070" end="00:01:33.810">that you can do their with how...but the reality is that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.810" end="00:01:37.670">artists have been making interactive or I should say they've</p>
      <p begin="00:01:37.670" end="00:01:43.270">been making visually quarrel what's the french I don't know</p>
      <p begin="00:01:43.270" end="00:01:49.050">...you may have trick of the...affects for years so maybe even</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.050" end="00:01:54.060">centuries...with paint and...so let's take a look at some of these so</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.060" end="00:01:58.630">shot out to axle p mahler the artist who did this gave us permission to use these</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.630" end="00:02:04.360">but if you notice here this is a parking garage that he did in sydney it looks as</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.360" end="00:02:10.060">if the up and out directions are sort of floating in the air and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:10.060" end="00:02:13.620">then the photos at the bottom show how that was actually done so again the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:18.120">perspective very important for creating this effect ...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.120" end="00:02:22.840">pop gave us permission to use his youtube video here again this</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.840" end="00:02:27.070">reebok's cube with the right perspective looks like an actual rick's cuban</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.070" end="00:02:31.990">...you the trick is revealed here with the rotation and then finally artist</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.990" end="00:02:38.540">edgar mueller thank you for...awesome projects</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.540" end="00:02:43.150">on sidewalks so it really looks like this germans about to fall into this curve</p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.150" end="00:02:47.610">...here's to kids having fun as they you know, go over this</p>
      <p begin="00:02:47.610" end="00:02:52.550">waterfall and then here edgar shows us how it's really done if you're in</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.550" end="00:02:58.350">the right position and you can see again perspective playing a real important role here</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.350" end="00:03:01.710">in these effects so again...in paint</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.010" end="00:03:07.570">are possible but now let's look at projection mapping soif</p>
      <p begin="00:03:07.570" end="00:03:12.340">you look at wikipedia you guys can all go up and look at the wikipedia page I took this from</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.340" end="00:03:16.560">their the blow-out here the thing that I want to point out is this technique</p>
      <p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:21.220">is also is used by artist and advertisers alike who can add extra dimensions optical</p>
      <p begin="00:03:21.220" end="00:03:26.120">illusions and notions of movement onto previously static</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.120" end="00:03:30.570">objects static so here's some examples again from wikipedia</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.570" end="00:03:36.290">page we've got this sculpture on the left adding these this textured look</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.290" end="00:03:41.140">at this visual look what I'm assuming is a casino here in the middle drawing people</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.140" end="00:03:46.020">...with projection mapping onto the building and then this other church very cool</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.020" end="00:03:48.040">...up at night again with projection</p>
      <p begin="00:03:48.040" end="00:03:53.700">mapping but these are static these objects don't move well,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.700" end="00:03:58.200">why...important talk about connect here what we're going to add connect into these projection</p>
      <p begin="00:03:58.200" end="00:04:03.070">mapping scenarios here name is going to talk more about this but with the connect we can</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.070" end="00:04:09.000">make these projection mapping experiences really interactive so,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.000" end="00:04:13.550">quickly about the connect if you're new to it we have a really powerful sdk</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.550" end="00:04:16.880">you can program apps in cplus-plus csharp</p>
      <p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:21.180">actually we were in montreal recently for...and we announce</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21.180" end="00:04:26.130">...connect to project...on get hub today...you're a python developer you can start</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.130" end="00:04:29.520">...connecting your experiences the connect</p>
      <p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:34.060">sensor gives us data sources we call them we have depth</p>
      <p begin="00:04:34.060" end="00:04:38.600">color infrared and even directional audio we're not going to use the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.600" end="00:04:44.110">latter to here we're really focus on depth and color but again the connect gives you all of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:44.110" end="00:04:49.350">those data sources you can also use if you already have an xbox one with</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.350" end="00:04:53.270">...connect we came out with an adaptor a few months ago that allows you to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53.270" end="00:04:56.650">plugged into a pc so you can use that and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.650" end="00:05:01.900">then also on get hub alive right now we've got this tutorial so</p>
      <p begin="00:05:01.900" end="00:05:06.610">if you're new to connect and you want to get through the entire platform...tutorials really,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.610" end="00:05:10.930">really great takes you through all aspects of the platform into and, its</p>
      <p begin="00:05:10.930" end="00:05:15.540">upon get hubs you can go take a look at that and then finally connect for windows dot com if you want</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.540" end="00:05:20.590">more information download the sdk check out our bloghow we do...felt like about</p>
      <p begin="00:05:20.590" end="00:05:27.700">sixty seconds...I wasn't timing it so I think with that I'm going to handed over to you any</p>
      <p begin="00:05:27.700" end="00:05:30.060">...overhearing drive the slides run</p>
      <p begin="00:05:30.060" end="00:05:35.400">...about some of your work so this is just a preview...some of the things that we're going to be doing withour</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.400" end="00:05:40.820">new you software but what I'd like to do next is get into a little bit of the some of the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:40.820" end="00:05:44.170">previous work we've done at microsoft research so we've been</p>
      <p begin="00:05:44.170" end="00:05:49.270">while working with projectors in-depth cameras for a little while with projects such as light space...and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:49.270" end="00:05:53.940">one-room room alive bima tran in a few others on the upper right here there's just</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.940" end="00:05:58.880">a quick of in yet of aluminum room and that's an interesting one that's you</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58.880" end="00:06:05.200">may have seen it uses a single projector a single camera and,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.200" end="00:06:09.230">then room alive down below the uses actually six cameras and six</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.230" end="00:06:15.080">projectors to actually do an entire room we can address both of these scenarios</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.080" end="00:06:19.720">in the software about to talk about so that software is called the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:19.720" end="00:06:22.970">...live toolkits over happy to announce that today</p>
      <p begin="00:06:22.970" end="00:06:29.550">this is basically a toolkit that allows you to do interactive projection mappings</p>
      <p begin="00:06:29.550" end="00:06:34.060">...for one second because I just want to get this plug-in about how awesome this is</p>
      <p begin="00:06:34.060" end="00:06:38.510">for me so last fall I'm going over to andes office and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:38.510" end="00:06:44.070">...said hey...you guys have all this awesome stuff that you've done using connect</p>
      <p begin="00:06:44.070" end="00:06:46.890">and is there some way that we can make this available to</p>
      <p begin="00:06:46.890" end="00:06:51.660">our broader developer community and those conversations let us to where we are today so</p>
      <p begin="00:06:51.660" end="00:06:56.610">...again I just I...to point out that you were awesome to work...and you had</p>
      <p begin="00:06:56.610" end="00:07:00.700">done all this awesome research so we're really happy to be able to packaged up in this</p>
      <p begin="00:07:00.700" end="00:07:05.020">toolkit and, I can avail awesome...so one of the things</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.020" end="00:07:10.340">that we've notices that the ...people are struggling out there a little bit to do some of these aluminum</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.340" end="00:07:13.760">...room alive scenarios by themselves so what</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.760" end="00:07:18.850">we're providing or some of the tools and we support multiple...multiple projectors together</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.850" end="00:07:23.060">in the same system and we're focusing today mostly on the calibration</p>
      <p begin="00:07:23.060" end="00:07:27.840">...aspects of it because I think that that's one of the parts the people out there have really have trouble with</p>
      <p begin="00:07:27.840" end="00:07:28.750">artists in</p>
      <p begin="00:07:28.750" end="00:07:33.000">...creative coders and that sort of those kinds of folks have trouble with that</p>
      <p begin="00:07:33.000" end="00:07:35.810">were also delivering a projection mapping set sample</p>
      <p begin="00:07:35.810" end="00:07:41.720">this very simple little sample to shows you what you can do once you have the calibration and this can</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.720" end="00:07:44.430">be released under the mit license?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44.430" end="00:07:47.000">And, here's the url for the source code on get</p>
      <p begin="00:07:47.000" end="00:07:51.080">hump go ahead and check that out today and here's just a quick</p>
      <p begin="00:07:51.080" end="00:07:57.350">rundown of the components and how they fit together it's a single visual studio solution everything's written csharp?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:57.350" end="00:08:02.790">we have calibrate ensemble that...which is a program that you run to actually initiate</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02.790" end="00:08:06.400">the calibration it relies on a dl here program</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:12.480">ensemble calibration and furthermore we have a this connect server...which is running</p>
      <p begin="00:08:12.480" end="00:08:15.490">...pc that's hosting a connect camera</p>
      <p begin="00:08:15.490" end="00:08:21.210">...app can then talk to both of these components to pick up the calibration</p>
      <p begin="00:08:21.210" end="00:08:26.070">information and also get the color in-depth information feature cameras on the networking go into this little bit later</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.070" end="00:08:30.810">in more detail this other executable projector server this is something that we're using</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30.810" end="00:08:35.700">today in calibration and...tidbit pro cam shortened</p>
      <p begin="00:08:37.010" end="00:08:40.260">...camera that's...taken together</p>
      <p begin="00:08:40.260" end="00:08:45.300">projector can-we like long names so projection mapping just this</p>
      <p begin="00:08:45.300" end="00:08:50.970">is a problem statement really just a quick way capsule what it is basically if you have a connect</p>
      <p begin="00:08:50.970" end="00:08:54.530">sensor that sensing the geometry the world and you have a viewer here is</p>
      <p begin="00:08:54.530" end="00:08:58.260">looking at the scene and the teapot here is projected the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:58.260" end="00:09:03.760">problem is given this viewers position and the geometry sense by the connects</p>
      <p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:08.230">...in the fact the projectors actually somewhere else in the room what kind of image</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.230" end="00:09:12.930">...form on the projectors such that this user from this position has the impression of</p>
      <p begin="00:09:12.930" end="00:09:17.470">their being a teapot sitting on this table...this table...be real so,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:17.470" end="00:09:21.620">you must account for the regularity of the projection surface the...the projector...viewers</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.620" end="00:09:24.390">...position so that's projection of this with the artist</p>
      <p begin="00:09:24.390" end="00:09:27.840">...and in our software essentially doing with the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:27.840" end="00:09:33.600">artist have been doing the same...calculation by doing...thirty times a second?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.600" end="00:09:37.770">So, this is the minimal configuration we think a lot of people are going to be looking at</p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.770" end="00:09:41.850">this because you might have one projector and one connect camera might be less</p>
      <p begin="00:09:41.850" end="00:09:46.520">likely have six cameras and six projectors so it's essentially a connect vtwo</p>
      <p begin="00:09:46.520" end="00:09:51.300">...plugged into a pc and projector plugged into a pc and you have the connect</p>
      <p begin="00:09:51.300" end="00:09:56.830">me to runtime you have this xml file calling ensemble that xml and that</p>
      <p begin="00:09:56.830" end="00:10:01.720">includes all of the calibration information that we're going to generate with our tool and</p>
      <p begin="00:10:01.720" end="00:10:06.790">then your application runs there and the rendering is done locally now</p>
      <p begin="00:10:06.790" end="00:10:09.530">going to m connection n projectors the situation gets a</p>
      <p begin="00:10:09.530" end="00:10:14.880">little more interesting perhaps today we will have support for</p>
      <p begin="00:10:14.880" end="00:10:19.400">a distributing multiple connect sensors across the network each plug into</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.400" end="00:10:23.230">the its own pc all these guys are plugged in the same switch and then we have</p>
      <p begin="00:10:23.230" end="00:10:30.280">host machine again which does all of the rendering to possibly multiple projectors?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:30.280" end="00:10:35.280">the room diagram so this is basically little bit more of a about the geometry of the connects</p>
      <p begin="00:10:35.280" end="00:10:39.880">and projectors and how they relate to one another so the idea is now we have</p>
      <p begin="00:10:39.880" end="00:10:44.990">projector the projects out into the room we have a connect camera looking out on to that room</p>
      <p begin="00:10:44.990" end="00:10:48.830">...this right now...projector group that's basically a projector</p>
      <p begin="00:10:48.830" end="00:10:52.940">and all of the connect sensors that can see whenever that projector some part of whatever</p>
      <p begin="00:10:52.940" end="00:10:58.680">the projector displays so that's a projector group another projector out</p>
      <p begin="00:10:58.680" end="00:11:04.480">over here some place else in the room might have another connect sensor next to it possibly</p>
      <p begin="00:11:04.480" end="00:11:09.030">a second camera and that would be another group so,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:09.030" end="00:11:12.040">these two groups are distinct there's no way to relate</p>
      <p begin="00:11:12.040" end="00:11:16.190">the geometry is of one group to the other until we actually add a</p>
      <p begin="00:11:16.190" end="00:11:18.930">...another connect camera so now we have three cameras</p>
      <p begin="00:11:18.930" end="00:11:23.880">and to projectors and now this particular camera that we just</p>
      <p begin="00:11:23.880" end="00:11:29.230">...a belongs to both groups and that's actually a critical feature of the calibration</p>
      <p begin="00:11:29.230" end="00:11:32.570">process and...were able to establish the geometry of the</p>
      <p begin="00:11:32.570" end="00:11:37.960">two groups together so we're just in so there's diagrams revise is these</p>
      <p begin="00:11:37.960" end="00:11:42.670">two projector groups so there's these groups actually overlap so taken together we're calling this</p>
      <p begin="00:11:42.670" end="00:11:48.500">an ensemble the two groups so,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:48.500" end="00:11:53.340">let's look into a little bit more detail on some of the components the program,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:53.340" end="00:11:57.020">program ensemble...ideologue is really the core of the project has all</p>
      <p begin="00:11:57.020" end="00:12:00.190">the calibration code and it is using the calibration step</p>
      <p begin="00:12:00.190" end="00:12:05.310">to acquire calibration patterns and calculate the camera parameters of</p>
      <p begin="00:12:05.310" end="00:12:10.560">connection projectors that includes quantities like the focal length and the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.560" end="00:12:15.760">...optical center of the camera as well as the dimensions of the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:15.760" end="00:12:21.270">camera so forth these are things you need to in the need to know so it also calculates the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:21.270" end="00:12:26.950">pose that is the position and orientation of all the connects and the projectors?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:26.950" end="00:12:34.000">And, then we...use this deal in runtime to basically provide</p>
      <p begin="00:12:34.000" end="00:12:38.160">a ways to interact with the calibration results and pull out the things you need in order to do</p>
      <p begin="00:12:38.160" end="00:12:43.430">the correct rendering so this is a class library there's no ui to speak of now connect</p>
      <p begin="00:12:43.430" end="00:12:46.370">servers and the another component...</p>
      <p begin="00:12:46.370" end="00:12:51.290">it uses windows communication foundation so we this is basically our tool to</p>
      <p begin="00:12:51.290" end="00:12:56.760">distribute color in data from each camera around the network has no</p>
      <p begin="00:12:56.760" end="00:13:02.670">ui today and basically started up and you forget about it runs on each pc with connect</p>
      <p begin="00:13:02.670" end="00:13:06.360">sensor so in my own work as I find it really heady</p>
      <p begin="00:13:06.360" end="00:13:11.300">to run remote desktop on each of these pc's and then you initiate the connect server</p>
      <p begin="00:13:11.300" end="00:13:15.770">there's a real tip in your already p options be sure to set the audio to</p>
      <p begin="00:13:15.770" end="00:13:21.170">play on remote computer otherwise the connect sdk does not the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:21.170" end="00:13:27.330">plate very nicely and that's a known issue in the connect sdk so if you're going to launch any sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:13:27.330" end="00:13:33.060">...remote desktop you really need to be wary of this consideration</p>
      <p begin="00:13:33.060" end="00:13:37.860">so obviously requires the connect from windows vtwo sdk and it...a</p>
      <p begin="00:13:37.860" end="00:13:42.820">give today gives you access to color depth and the camera interns excess the focal length the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:42.820" end="00:13:48.550">principle point so forth across network in a fairly easy wham.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:48.550" end="00:13:51.390">So, projector server that exes another one</p>
      <p begin="00:13:51.390" end="00:13:55.850">another component that's run on the network and that's analogous to</p>
      <p begin="00:13:55.850" end="00:14:00.170">the connect server directly runs...every machine has a projector</p>
      <p begin="00:14:00.170" end="00:14:04.460">and today we only use that during the calibration step and we're</p>
      <p begin="00:14:04.460" end="00:14:08.600">...delivering a runt a distributed rendering framework today this is</p>
      <p begin="00:14:08.600" end="00:14:12.950">basically a means to calibrate possibly many projectors</p>
      <p begin="00:14:12.950" end="00:14:17.300">...could be the foundation for distributed rendering framework that we might deliver are</p>
      <p begin="00:14:17.300" end="00:14:22.590">the someone could help us out with the idea there would be we can</p>
      <p begin="00:14:22.590" end="00:14:27.510">do something much more like a projectors twelve projectors you probably need to get</p>
      <p begin="00:14:27.510" end="00:14:31.100">off of the same single host pc at that</p>
      <p begin="00:14:31.100" end="00:14:35.700">point so right so if you have more than three projectors calibrate ensemble</p>
      <p begin="00:14:35.700" end="00:14:40.150">...that's a little bit of a ui you can actually do the calibration without any</p>
      <p begin="00:14:40.150" end="00:14:44.040">...a...functions are all there but...things along into</p>
      <p begin="00:14:44.040" end="00:14:48.020">...in configuration we provide a very simple user interfaces</p>
      <p begin="00:14:48.020" end="00:14:52.800">picture here and it runs allows you to run the calibration procedure</p>
      <p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:54.840">...creates this xml file is</p>
      <p begin="00:14:54.840" end="00:14:59.830">stores the calibration info and allows you to view the results so your application</p>
      <p begin="00:14:59.830" end="00:15:04.740">...in xml file and again it does its own rendering today we provide a simple</p>
      <p begin="00:15:04.740" end="00:15:09.760">projection mapping application that includes much of direct three-d eleven shatters</p>
      <p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:14.520">...the rendering including the projection mapping and handling the depth image</p>
      <p begin="00:15:14.520" end="00:15:18.780">in converting the depth image to world coordinates and mash and vertex data.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:18.780" end="00:15:21.070">So, calibration again,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:21.070" end="00:15:25.270">this is all about finding the position impose of every...along with focal length and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:25.270" end="00:15:29.960">...distortion the projectors display...called grey codes and,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:29.960" end="00:15:34.320">these are observed by all the...connects color cameras that way they can</p>
      <p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:39.030">establish the projector groups like what which cameras...which groups with</p>
      <p begin="00:15:39.030" end="00:15:45.180">the projectors and I'm not going to get into the details of how great codes work is very interesting but</p>
      <p begin="00:15:45.180" end="00:15:48.910">...to say that what we're doing here is to is obtaining a series of depth</p>
      <p begin="00:15:48.910" end="00:15:51.760">camera three-d points and...corresponding</p>
      <p begin="00:15:51.760" end="00:15:56.700">position and each of the projector images so that's what you need in order to really</p>
      <p begin="00:15:56.700" end="00:16:01.410">performer calibration the calibration patterns are...to disk you</p>
      <p begin="00:16:01.410" end="00:16:05.580">...run acquisition phase and then disconnect from your network or what</p>
      <p begin="00:16:05.580" end="00:16:09.420">...leave your lab and then you can run the calibration procedure</p>
      <p begin="00:16:09.420" end="00:16:14.390">offlineso, you don't even need access to your cameras in your projectors that</p>
      <p begin="00:16:14.390" end="00:16:20.120">...to play around with the calibration so let's do a quick demo of</p>
      <p begin="00:16:20.120" end="00:16:25.550">the calibration and all right so let's look at the demo the calibration</p>
      <p begin="00:16:25.550" end="00:16:31.000">tool so I'm in visual studio here and I'm just going to hit</p>
      <p begin="00:16:31.000" end="00:16:35.250">...five run the tool this is what it looks like there's not much to see here the first thing we</p>
      <p begin="00:16:35.250" end="00:16:39.890">want to do is hit new this allows us to create a new of xml files</p>
      <p begin="00:16:39.890" end="00:16:44.100">going-to dial-in three projectors and three cameras</p>
      <p begin="00:16:45.130" end="00:16:48.650">...is synonymous with connect here?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:48.650" end="00:16:53.750">That's right...connect sensor and I'm going to create a.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:53.750" end="00:16:59.020">A new folder for this all calibration results are stored in a little folder</p>
      <p begin="00:16:59.020" end="00:17:06.550">going to put here and then I'm going to call that file ...</p>
      <p begin="00:17:06.550" end="00:17:10.550">...go into that folder first and then call that.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:10.550" end="00:17:11.050">Ensemble.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:12.090" end="00:17:15.690">That xml.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.690" end="00:17:17.670">Okay, so, that's good so then what I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:17:17.670" end="00:17:24.560">...do is I'm actually...open that up in visual studio so that we can so,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:24.560" end="00:17:29.470">I can show you what that looks like and some resume up just a little bit so you</p>
      <p begin="00:17:29.470" end="00:17:35.630">see this little bit more easily so this is basically layout of this</p>
      <p begin="00:17:35.630" end="00:17:40.860">...file has a number of cameras and projectors listed</p>
      <p begin="00:17:40.860" end="00:17:45.560">okay so for each of these cameras and has a...a friendly name which in the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:45.560" end="00:17:50.760">lab an example I'm going to show you later I have three projectors three cameras and I</p>
      <p begin="00:17:50.760" end="00:17:55.330">call them center-left and rights and then the host name</p>
      <p begin="00:17:55.330" end="00:17:59.630">...address could be something like in the machine happens to be name...zero</p>
      <p begin="00:17:59.630" end="00:18:04.090">notice also the...information here this is actually a four-by-four matrix</p>
      <p begin="00:18:05.100" end="00:18:10.080">that would be familiar to anyone who in using doing graphics programming that's actually</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.080" end="00:18:14.560">specified here and this file for the very first camera the very first camera</p>
      <p begin="00:18:14.560" end="00:18:19.640">establishes the coordinate system for the entire ensemble so this is filled in for you it</p>
      <p begin="00:18:19.640" end="00:18:24.470">assumes basically that the first...actually at this</p>
      <p begin="00:18:24.470" end="00:18:28.720">...within the global...frame if you had some other reason to establish a</p>
      <p begin="00:18:28.720" end="00:18:34.220">different position for that camera you could fill that information in now for the other cameras</p>
      <p begin="00:18:34.220" end="00:18:39.080">what is it fair to say than like we don't expect these numbers to change post</p>
      <p begin="00:18:39.080" end="00:18:44.000">calibration this is sort of the origin of the whole thing and everything else is going to be calibrated</p>
      <p begin="00:18:44.000" end="00:18:47.100">to that that's right that's right so if you had some other</p>
      <p begin="00:18:47.100" end="00:18:51.210">...sorry some other coordinate system like the room coordinates the, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:51.210" end="00:18:55.410">like if you...actually using this...scenario you might actually have reason to edit</p>
      <p begin="00:18:55.410" end="00:18:58.240">this but that will never change at least for the very first</p>
      <p begin="00:18:58.240" end="00:19:03.420">camera so the other cameras don't have any pose information that can be filled in later so,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:03.420" end="00:19:09.660">I can change that and then writes and that sort of thing and then fill in</p>
      <p begin="00:19:09.660" end="00:19:13.230">...changes from local host?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:13.230" end="00:19:18.500">...was...room alive five.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:18.500" end="00:19:22.270">Remodel if.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:22.270" end="00:19:23.510">Three.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:23.510" end="00:19:26.805">And, then so, that's a for the cameras how the so what I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:19:26.805" end="00:19:33.410">to do now is open up the projectors...the same sort of scenario here</p>
      <p begin="00:19:33.410" end="00:19:38.810">where I can fill in the third friendly names for the projectors this kind of you</p>
      <p begin="00:19:38.810" end="00:19:45.840">have to changes just really nice to be able to do that and, then the actual within height your refer to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:50.540">the display dimensions those are things that are will be auto discovered by the projector server that</p>
      <p begin="00:19:50.540" end="00:19:55.100">exiting and then I'm going-to leave these locus right now because we're today we're doing</p>
      <p begin="00:19:55.100" end="00:19:58.950">a local rendering so I hit control the save I</p>
      <p begin="00:19:58.950" end="00:20:04.790">go back to my application and then here there's a reload functionality and then</p>
      <p begin="00:20:04.790" end="00:20:08.830">so, loads that now so, for the purposes of this demonstration</p>
      <p begin="00:20:08.830" end="00:20:12.920">...going to do next is actually we're not going to the trigger the acquisition</p>
      <p begin="00:20:12.920" end="00:20:18.170">phase I can do that here with this option because we don't have the cameras in</p>
      <p begin="00:20:18.170" end="00:20:23.430">the projectors here in the studio today I'm not going to do that so what I'm going to do instead</p>
      <p begin="00:20:23.430" end="00:20:28.380">also want to bore everyone sitting here making him wait a bunch...weight well it all</p>
      <p begin="00:20:28.380" end="00:20:33.340">happens so that's right but what I can do is show you a quick video of what that looks like in the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:33.340" end="00:20:38.340">...so when I hit calibrate acquire this is what happens let me explain what's going on here so we</p>
      <p begin="00:20:38.340" end="00:20:43.760">have three projectors today in this example these are all the same...model they don't have to be the same</p>
      <p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:47.790">...can be different resolutions so forth and then three other connect we</p>
      <p begin="00:20:47.790" end="00:20:51.440">to cameras there and these are just sort of casually place saturn</p>
      <p begin="00:20:51.440" end="00:20:55.030">...any time worrying about mounting and then this otherconnect camera's</p>
      <p begin="00:20:55.030" end="00:21:01.500">actually is almost not use it all...is not even relevant for this calibration is actually</p>
      <p begin="00:21:01.500" end="00:21:08.220">uses a head tracking camera for demo they're going to show later so don't worry too much about that one so,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:08.220" end="00:21:11.420">we need to...the so that they're that they overlap</p>
      <p begin="00:21:11.420" end="00:21:15.540">has explained earlier and I'll show you a little bit what that means.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:15.540" end="00:21:17.630">So, play this video.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:17.630" end="00:21:22.350">...a moment ...these ...going to show that that's</p>
      <p begin="00:21:22.350" end="00:21:27.850">basically just a handy feature for-you to be able to view the results so, it takes</p>
      <p begin="00:21:27.850" end="00:21:32.690">a snapshot from the color camera now the centric projectors now projecting a series of</p>
      <p begin="00:21:32.690" end="00:21:38.900">...code so these are the...codes that you're used to establishes mapping from a pixel</p>
      <p begin="00:21:38.900" end="00:21:44.050">in the color camera to a pixel coordinate in the projected display so,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:44.050" end="00:21:48.330">that's a pretty critical feature so now I've just spent the video up a little bit because</p>
      <p begin="00:21:48.330" end="00:21:51.970">...kind of boring after...you seen a couple these so,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:51.970" end="00:21:56.800">you just let this thing run and then after a few minutes...it finishes so that's the acquisition</p>
      <p begin="00:21:56.800" end="00:22:03.550">face without point so, that point we have.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:03.550" end="00:22:06.830">Stop this and I'll show you a little bit what we have with</p>
      <p begin="00:22:06.830" end="00:22:10.050">someone switch now to this other calibration which</p>
      <p begin="00:22:10.050" end="00:22:16.020">is like cooking show right where that we pulled the thing out of the evidence magically done so,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:16.020" end="00:22:20.200">we have a...xml file here which now has a bit more information</p>
      <p begin="00:22:20.200" end="00:22:25.170">has things like the color camera matrix in this kinds of things, things that are pull off of each of</p>
      <p begin="00:22:25.170" end="00:22:31.485">the connect cameras and then also windows this directory layout...if we really want</p>
      <p begin="00:22:31.485" end="00:22:36.150">to get into the directory layout but let me real quickly just show a couple of things that so,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:36.150" end="00:22:40.500">we have directory for each of the cameras...a directory for each of the projectors the</p>
      <p begin="00:22:40.500" end="00:22:47.930">camera includes things like the just the color image make that little</p>
      <p begin="00:22:47.930" end="00:22:54.700">bit larger and the mean depth image so forth so you can that's kind of useful</p>
      <p begin="00:22:54.700" end="00:22:59.590">to see what's going on there the projector directory now has directory within</p>
      <p begin="00:22:59.590" end="00:23:05.220">within it for each camera intern and that includes the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:05.220" end="00:23:09.950">gray codes as viewed from each of the cameras for that projector so,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:09.950" end="00:23:16.350">that's so, that's basically all store on-disk so it's kind of a large directory so if we move</p>
      <p begin="00:23:16.350" end="00:23:19.500">over to the left camera you'll see that as a</p>
      <p begin="00:23:19.500" end="00:23:24.310">slightly skewed perspective now because you reviewing the center projector from the left cameras so you would</p>
      <p begin="00:23:24.310" end="00:23:29.340">expectto not be able to see the entire projected</p>
      <p begin="00:23:29.340" end="00:23:34.150">...important that the one of the camera...of the other camera's actually be able to see part of that</p>
      <p begin="00:23:34.150" end="00:23:41.690">projector ok so that's the directory so now at this point but, so, after the acquisition</p>
      <p begin="00:23:41.690" end="00:23:46.400">phase runs all that's created and then the ensemble dot xml</p>
      <p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:51.220">is updated to have all of those interns x in there and that's what that's really</p>
      <p begin="00:23:51.220" end="00:23:55.060">the,...just as intrinsic now for the connect...connect</p>
      <p begin="00:23:55.060" end="00:24:00.490">...so we haven't actually performed any calibration yet so we've just on acquisition we've gotten some of the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:00.490" end="00:24:07.240">information we need now we need to go back to the tool going to open up that particular.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:07.240" end="00:24:10.320">Calibration set-up that we were looking for.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:14.620">Looking at and the load that one and,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:14.620" end="00:24:22.410">then I would now hit solve oddity.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:22.410" end="00:24:25.370">Calibrate menu is going to open that up a so,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:25.370" end="00:24:29.890">this is kicking off now the actual calibration and you can see what's going on here is decoding the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:29.890" end="00:24:34.880">great code image...those off of disk for each of the views so there's three cameras three</p>
      <p begin="00:24:34.880" end="00:24:38.230">...so that's nine sets.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:38.230" end="00:24:44.050">And,...it takes a little, little bit of time and then the next phase where it actually performs bit of</p>
      <p begin="00:24:44.050" end="00:24:48.600">analysis determine the visibility so it...projector center here is seen by</p>
      <p begin="00:24:48.600" end="00:24:52.970">...center projector...seen my camera left and camera right</p>
      <p begin="00:24:52.970" end="00:24:58.110">so that's interesting so now we have the center projector and the projector group</p>
      <p begin="00:24:58.110" end="00:25:03.120">...of the sent the center projector group includes all three cameras so this is like the bridge</p>
      <p begin="00:25:03.120" end="00:25:06.320">...thing that establishes...glue.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:06.320" end="00:25:09.690">Between all three cameras in the three projectors we also</p>
      <p begin="00:25:09.690" end="00:25:14.310">have the left camera or the left projector and the right projector so this next</p>
      <p begin="00:25:14.310" end="00:25:20.270">bit here shows the actual camera matrix associated with the projector so,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:20.270" end="00:25:25.400">that includes the focal length of the projector and also the center from</p>
      <p begin="00:25:25.400" end="00:25:28.570">...optics point of view the optical center the projector</p>
      <p begin="00:25:28.570" end="00:25:31.730">...numbers...kind of funny the optical center is so there's a twelve</p>
      <p begin="00:25:31.730" end="00:25:37.780">...by seven twenty projector which puts the middle the x coordinate the horizontal axis</p>
      <p begin="00:25:37.780" end="00:25:42.550">at about six twenty which seems reasonable but then...negative values really interesting and</p>
      <p begin="00:25:42.550" end="00:25:47.270">that's because when you look at the projector the optical center</p>
      <p begin="00:25:47.270" end="00:25:50.240">is actually...this is why when you put projector down</p>
      <p begin="00:25:50.240" end="00:25:55.630">the desktop it actually doesn't project into the desktop but above it only uses the top half of the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:55.630" end="00:25:57.210">...so that's why</p>
      <p begin="00:25:57.210" end="00:26:01.690">those that numbers negative anyway so this is getting into a little bit maybe...more</p>
      <p begin="00:26:01.690" end="00:26:06.670">...you need to understand the tool but it's kind of interesting to look at these kinds of things</p>
      <p begin="00:26:06.670" end="00:26:09.160">and the reason why we're sort of dumping</p>
      <p begin="00:26:09.160" end="00:26:14.170">...stuff out is so that we can take a look at what's going on so that's going to run for a while it</p>
      <p begin="00:26:14.170" end="00:26:17.900">performs a calibration for each of the projector groups</p>
      <p begin="00:26:17.900" end="00:26:22.780">intern so that's...be running for three times and then actually does a</p>
      <p begin="00:26:22.780" end="00:26:27.180">much more involved global optimization over all the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:27.180" end="00:26:34.000">cameras and projectors to establish just make sure that everything's nice and, ...</p>
      <p begin="00:26:34.000" end="00:26:37.270">So,...let that run now for a little while but what I can</p>
      <p begin="00:26:37.270" end="00:26:44.120">...can...well that's running is because this is actually a fully baked.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:44.120" end="00:26:47.290">See what I think I'll do is stop the.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:47.290" end="00:26:50.580">This calibration...by exiting the program and then.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:50.580" end="00:26:55.220">We loading that one.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:55.220" end="00:26:58.700">Then I'll show you a little bit of the results are kind of fun</p>
      <p begin="00:26:58.700" end="00:27:02.790">to look at so this other pain...I haven't mentioned</p>
      <p begin="00:27:02.790" end="00:27:09.600">is showing you remember it flashed up those images for the each projector that had the projector name</p>
      <p begin="00:27:09.600" end="00:27:17.560">it also has the radical for each of those so, we have so,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:17.560" end="00:27:23.560">I can use the wa...and, the mouse the to rotate also</p>
      <p begin="00:27:23.560" end="00:27:29.470">...ctwo to move up and down in the scene so this shows us the data that's collected color...data</p>
      <p begin="00:27:29.470" end="00:27:34.230">merge for each route for all three projectors and cameras...you get an idea of</p>
      <p begin="00:27:34.230" end="00:27:40.000">...quality of the registration it's not too bad, you know, we're not we're not doing any color</p>
      <p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:44.990">calibration so there's a little bit of color...camera has its own white balance so,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:44.990" end="00:27:51.220">that's something we can look at in the future.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:51.220" end="00:27:57.150">So, then this menu appear deserves some comments so right now this graphics</p>
      <p begin="00:27:57.150" end="00:28:01.090">...under a fairly traditional perspective graphics camera</p>
      <p begin="00:28:01.090" end="00:28:05.960">but because we know the part of now the camera matrix reach of</p>
      <p begin="00:28:05.960" end="00:28:10.620">the projectors we can actually dial-in a completely different projection matrix that goes with</p>
      <p begin="00:28:10.620" end="00:28:16.390">each of the projectors so I think this is really interesting viewed sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:28:16.390" end="00:28:21.430">...shows you the quality of the registration for the to projector because what does</p>
      <p begin="00:28:21.430" end="00:28:26.030">...view shows you is view of the room.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:26.030" end="00:28:30.520">From the projectors point of view now because it's a color image</p>
      <p begin="00:28:30.520" end="00:28:34.930">acquired from the connect sensor it's actually that image was actually</p>
      <p begin="00:28:34.930" end="00:28:40.060">...from some other place...not at the same places the projector could be on the other side</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.060" end="00:28:43.770">of the room so we're using all of the math we just did</p>
      <p begin="00:28:43.770" end="00:28:48.020">to synthesize what that image would look like from the projectors point of</p>
      <p begin="00:28:48.020" end="00:28:53.230">view so this these words here the center and then this radical here</p>
      <p begin="00:28:53.230" end="00:29:00.000">...sort of running along the outside is not rendered by this graphics this</p>
      <p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:04.970">routine here but is really captured in baked into the color image so we would if</p>
      <p begin="00:29:04.970" end="00:29:10.510">everything's working really well we respect this radical now to line-up fairly precisely with</p>
      <p begin="00:29:10.510" end="00:29:16.440">the edges of the frame because of the perspective the projection matrix is basically</p>
      <p begin="00:29:16.440" end="00:29:19.360">set to...that of the projector so,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:26.530">that's all very difficult to follow just I think the things are too so,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:26.530" end="00:29:30.730">just to look at is the fact that when I match the, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:32.130" end="00:29:37.110">the projection of the projector...using the word projection</p>
      <p begin="00:29:37.110" end="00:29:43.240">into different sensors little bit confusing we now have fairly decent alignment so we can also</p>
      <p begin="00:29:43.240" end="00:29:48.380">check out the same thing for the left projector and then</p>
      <p begin="00:29:48.380" end="00:29:51.980">for the right projector so everything's looking really good and</p>
      <p begin="00:29:51.980" end="00:29:57.030">it's pretty tight actually the zs things go so?</p>
      <p begin="00:29:57.030" end="00:30:05.470">I think that is enough demo for of the calibration tool</p>
      <p begin="00:30:05.470" end="00:30:11.740">Back to.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:11.740" end="00:30:20.400">It's...on turn back to the presentation...where we were.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:20.400" end="00:30:25.050">So, what I'd like to do now is show a quick,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:26.220" end="00:30:32.290">yeah, so, the show a quick a couple demos from our sample so we what</p>
      <p begin="00:30:32.290" end="00:30:35.500">we've done is deliver a very simple projection mapping sample</p>
      <p begin="00:30:35.500" end="00:30:38.440">...shows to main effects ...</p>
      <p begin="00:30:39.690" end="00:30:44.070">The calibration phases like sort of completely separate from the projection mapping but we think a lot of people going</p>
      <p begin="00:30:44.070" end="00:30:47.810">to be using the calibration results do projection mapping as</p>
      <p begin="00:30:47.810" end="00:30:53.100">with womb alive and aluminum so one of the more popular effects and aluminum was</p>
      <p begin="00:30:53.100" end="00:30:57.650">as wobble effect so when you actually fired a gun in the game the whole role</p>
      <p begin="00:30:57.650" end="00:31:01.880">...kind of distort momentarily is really kind of interesting effect and</p>
      <p begin="00:31:01.880" end="00:31:06.260">it was done basically by...taking the color images sense but the connect</p>
      <p begin="00:31:06.260" end="00:31:11.170">center which was done offline and projecting that back with a little bit of edge enhancement color enhancement</p>
      <p begin="00:31:11.170" end="00:31:15.440">and then distorting it in our sort of interesting real-time fashion</p>
      <p begin="00:31:15.440" end="00:31:20.780">so I basically very quickly re implement that for this setup so,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:20.780" end="00:31:25.410">...aluminum just use one camera one projector here we're actually using three so,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:25.410" end="00:31:31.240">we're getting a similar kind of effect but on a broader scale so in caps as more the more</p>
      <p begin="00:31:31.240" end="00:31:36.830">of the room now I don't have the audio...the game or anything like that so it's a little little</p>
      <p begin="00:31:36.830" end="00:31:41.570">contrived maybe but it does give you an idea of some of the alignments so,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:41.570" end="00:31:45.130">quality alignment and some of the things that we can do so of course instead of</p>
      <p begin="00:31:45.130" end="00:31:49.240">...wobble effect you could imagine doing any sort of artistic</p>
      <p begin="00:31:49.240" end="00:31:54.030">sharing on your environment so this is not alive image where this is just a</p>
      <p begin="00:31:54.030" end="00:31:58.340">...with...lumen room so we're not what taking live data hear from the each of the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:58.340" end="00:32:05.410">sensors and then projecting that back but will demonstrate that in a moment.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:05.410" end="00:32:10.180">the second example is the three-d object...so this is a more about</p>
      <p begin="00:32:10.180" end="00:32:15.170">rendering a three-d object hovering in space in front of you and doing the correct</p>
      <p begin="00:32:15.170" end="00:32:20.300">...dependent rendering for that so using...the very same projection mapping</p>
      <p begin="00:32:20.300" end="00:32:25.830">shatter as we use for the wobble effect now rendering a three-d object so,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:25.830" end="00:32:30.490">the geometry years very simple of the sample includes and ...file loader</p>
      <p begin="00:32:30.490" end="00:32:35.500">there's nothing terribly interesting about that does not really the point what we're doing here so now we're</p>
      <p begin="00:32:35.500" end="00:32:42.610">using the this camera to actually do a bit of head tracking so it's a pretty pretty easily get</p>
      <p begin="00:32:42.610" end="00:32:47.810">going with had tracking...dependent rendering...in as the head position and then as I move around</p>
      <p begin="00:32:47.810" end="00:32:54.250">...get to see different parts of the model and notice also that the</p>
      <p begin="00:32:54.250" end="00:32:59.240">...projector set...up so that it projects into the corner of the room which in some</p>
      <p begin="00:32:59.240" end="00:33:01.630">ways...like kind of the most difficult scenario normally</p>
      <p begin="00:33:01.630" end="00:33:06.170">...projector it projects onto a flat wall in your room here</p>
      <p begin="00:33:06.170" end="00:33:10.730">...projecting right in the corner and but for a little bit of distortion</p>
      <p begin="00:33:10.730" end="00:33:16.750">there in the corner it actually looks pretty straight these lines...pretty straight...you looks correct.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:16.750" end="00:33:19.470">Notice also that it's a it's quite a large display</p>
      <p begin="00:33:19.470" end="00:33:26.200">...in accomplices quite a big partner visual field of view.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:26.200" end="00:33:29.740">So, that's the that's the sum of our</p>
      <p begin="00:33:29.740" end="00:33:35.070">and, we just say like even though we're shipping both of those as a single sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:35.070" end="00:33:39.650">I think you could also say those are two different samples because there's very different but we've just package those up</p>
      <p begin="00:33:39.650" end="00:33:44.960">right now and that's running them as a single sample in there that's what they use the same sweet of</p>
      <p begin="00:33:44.960" end="00:33:50.240">...three-d...so, it's actually there's a lot more common so each of these</p>
      <p begin="00:33:50.240" end="00:33:55.820">...than you might think so the basic calculation that is doing is pretty much the same,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:55.820" end="00:33:58.960">yeah, one thing to add is that with</p>
      <p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:05.670">the three-d object rendering that we're looking at here I wasn't actually in the lab when you</p>
      <p begin="00:34:05.670" end="00:34:10.020">were shooting the video but if I ran through the scene in there if</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.020" end="00:34:15.430">I got in there and jumped in you would see this object</p>
      <p begin="00:34:15.430" end="00:34:19.660">then projected not only on the walls on the furniture but also on to me, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:19.660" end="00:34:22.490">that's a great point of thanks for mentioning that</p>
      <p begin="00:34:22.490" end="00:34:27.880">it's really important point to remember that this in this particular example is the depth and</p>
      <p begin="00:34:27.880" end="00:34:32.780">color who actually just the depth information in this case is being read...from you to the three cameras</p>
      <p begin="00:34:32.780" end="00:34:37.590">and real-time so that if I if somebody walked into the scene...moved to this chair,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:37.590" end="00:34:42.370">for example, it would update in real-time you wouldn't the viewer...not really notice</p>
      <p begin="00:34:42.370" end="00:34:47.640">the difference would it would it would just sort of take that and stride I think that's one of the ways that</p>
      <p begin="00:34:47.640" end="00:34:52.540">the system differs from some of the projection mapping software that's out there already typically</p>
      <p begin="00:34:52.540" end="00:34:57.520">with the projection mapping software out there is not a three-d problem it's like you've taken of uni</p>
      <p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:01.900">know the position of the camera you shooting a large building sarah church as</p>
      <p begin="00:35:01.900" end="00:35:07.060">...the...example we showed the church isn't moving so you can establish</p>
      <p begin="00:35:07.060" end="00:35:10.740">...really what amounts to a tutti transform</p>
      <p begin="00:35:10.740" end="00:35:16.190">the maps the desired view to the different components of the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:16.190" end="00:35:21.470">...facade so that's some that's in some sense a and easier</p>
      <p begin="00:35:21.470" end="00:35:26.340">...what we're doing here on the other hand having the three-d data from connect also</p>
      <p begin="00:35:26.340" end="00:35:31.030">make some of these calculations quite easy to do it's really</p>
      <p begin="00:35:31.030" end="00:35:35.650">...question finding the correct graphics transforms coordinate transforms to make all</p>
      <p begin="00:35:35.650" end="00:35:40.380">...stuff possible so right so with interactive projection map interactive</p>
      <p begin="00:35:40.380" end="00:35:46.240">in the sense that you can go and move things around and it's all being done every</p>
      <p begin="00:35:46.240" end="00:35:51.020">...essentially...new problem we're doing it again as I said earlier we're doing that projection mapping problem the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:51.020" end="00:35:54.970">...of done essentially...video...</p>
      <p begin="00:35:54.970" end="00:35:56.070">So, that's</p>
      <p begin="00:35:56.070" end="00:36:01.970">the sample just a quick few words about future work before we close.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:01.970" end="00:36:07.840">There's...to be done, you know, the source code is certainly still very much influx</p>
      <p begin="00:36:07.840" end="00:36:12.780">I'm making changes all the time some of the higher-level things that...would be nice</p>
      <p begin="00:36:12.780" end="00:36:18.290">to see right now we have a connect server implementation that really is just</p>
      <p begin="00:36:18.290" end="00:36:22.960">tune so that I can get the calibration work done it's not a full implementation</p>
      <p begin="00:36:22.960" end="00:36:27.860">there's lots of things missing like there's no support for the body tracking in the server ir image</p>
      <p begin="00:36:27.860" end="00:36:33.450">...that's pretty...so we could put that in any time something a little more</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.450" end="00:36:36.260">challenging probably interesting to a lot of people out there is</p>
      <p begin="00:36:36.260" end="00:36:41.720">support for unity so we in our own work we say with</p>
      <p begin="00:36:41.720" end="00:36:47.000">...room...some of the other newer projects we've been moving some of our rendering to unity and</p>
      <p begin="00:36:47.000" end="00:36:52.880">...entails some interesting challenges and working with all of the stuff that we use</p>
      <p begin="00:36:52.880" end="00:36:58.380">we're using the same calibration routines so the idea would be would be to have unity three-d plug-in</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.380" end="00:37:02.300">allows us to median that xml file and then use all of a unity</p>
      <p begin="00:37:02.300" end="00:37:06.940">...goodness in terms of rendering...loading models and animation so forth</p>
      <p begin="00:37:06.940" end="00:37:11.690">...that's really nice because then you can take all the calibration stuff that</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.690" end="00:37:16.670">you've done and throw this at an artist somebody who really knows how to generate assets</p>
      <p begin="00:37:16.670" end="00:37:22.870">and they can as we've seen in our own work they can make progress very quickly.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:22.870" end="00:37:27.830">Harder saying is doing proper blending at...you go back and look at some of the videos</p>
      <p begin="00:37:27.830" end="00:37:32.090">we...showed you'll notice that we don't handle the case where the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:32.090" end="00:37:34.800">to projectors overlap very well they essentially</p>
      <p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:40.580">the project twice over that scene so you actually see some brighter images</p>
      <p begin="00:37:40.580" end="00:37:43.920">are brighter areas there were actually projecting twice over the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:43.920" end="00:37:49.510">same little area now that's something I think really needs to be...other people that are</p>
      <p begin="00:37:49.510" end="00:37:54.410">looked at projector blending if you wanted to set up a bunch of projectors and then and then project</p>
      <p begin="00:37:54.410" end="00:37:59.250">onto a flat surface this is a little more challenging here now because everything is in three-d and</p>
      <p begin="00:37:59.250" end="00:38:03.850">as we were just talking about everything is interactive three-d things can change so it's not</p>
      <p begin="00:38:03.850" end="00:38:08.770">as question of finding a single static way to carve up the projected images</p>
      <p begin="00:38:08.770" end="00:38:13.610">you actually have to change that and real-time because as things move</p>
      <p begin="00:38:13.610" end="00:38:19.130">let's say forwards backwards and from the camera that the place where you want to carve up the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:19.130" end="00:38:23.910">projection actually changes so it's a harder problem and that's something that would have to be</p>
      <p begin="00:38:23.910" end="00:38:31.290">computed sort of on-the-fly perhaps best computed one of the shatters so I think the whole</p>
      <p begin="00:38:31.290" end="00:38:34.950">...harder thing actually is to nail the color calibration</p>
      <p begin="00:38:34.950" end="00:38:39.610">think it's pretty obvious and some of the examples that the color we're not</p>
      <p begin="00:38:39.610" end="00:38:43.770">...color calibration at all so, there's a couple of issues</p>
      <p begin="00:38:43.770" end="00:38:48.280">there's one is the color calibration the projection color calibration of the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:48.280" end="00:38:52.740">cameras right now the cameras all have their own white balance need to nail that down another</p>
      <p begin="00:38:52.740" end="00:38:58.040">perhaps more interesting the problem is the fact that we're projecting onto real-world</p>
      <p begin="00:38:58.040" end="00:39:01.850">environment's like say the couch or your rug wall whatever</p>
      <p begin="00:39:01.850" end="00:39:06.890">...be nice to actually compensate for the surface reflections and the color of those objects</p>
      <p begin="00:39:06.890" end="00:39:10.530">...actually generating graphics...a little bit of that</p>
      <p begin="00:39:10.530" end="00:39:13.690">no one-room is very simplistic other much more interesting</p>
      <p begin="00:39:13.690" end="00:39:19.240">and capable models out there and we've got none of that stuff right now in the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:19.240" end="00:39:25.940">room alive toolkit so that's something that we nice to the app so ...go</p>
