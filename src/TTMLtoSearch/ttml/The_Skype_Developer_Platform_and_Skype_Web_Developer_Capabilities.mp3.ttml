      <p begin="00:10:55.770" end="00:11:00.850">such as keynote about how you can now start to get advantage of data in the graph and the ability free to bring</p>
      <p begin="00:11:00.850" end="00:11:05.610">skylight messages and content into that graph we think it's going to be an amazing opportunity</p>
      <p begin="00:11:05.610" end="00:11:09.740">a really across a variety of different applications now we support this with</p>
      <p begin="00:11:09.740" end="00:11:13.340">a set a very broad set of first party clients everything from stated</p>
      <p begin="00:11:13.340" end="00:11:17.700">...desktop...android ios...recently announced</p>
      <p begin="00:11:17.700" end="00:11:22.410">...client for apple watch which is obviously just come out so this is about giving</p>
      <p begin="00:11:22.410" end="00:11:27.080">you a great first party experience very quickly across the widest range of platforms</p>
      <p begin="00:11:27.080" end="00:11:32.380">...you can but it's also about building out and doing this with a core model for how</p>
      <p begin="00:11:32.380" end="00:11:37.000">use developers can take advantage of scape now the history of development with...and</p>
      <p begin="00:11:37.000" end="00:11:41.760">...for business and formally known as link was very focused on sort of rich clients and extending when</p>
      <p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:46.620">thirty-two and on the server-side with the link server it was really about how you can now take advantage of the</p>
      <p begin="00:11:46.620" end="00:11:52.100">server capabilities as we move forward this is really about supporting...new restful based approach that</p>
      <p begin="00:11:52.100" end="00:11:56.970">allows you to really drive this with sort of the best of the device and the best of the cloud that allows you to get more</p>
      <p begin="00:11:56.970" end="00:12:01.880">as a developer and this really...drives into the third-party ecosystem that we're building</p>
      <p begin="00:12:01.880" end="00:12:06.740">...scales everything from partner cloud services to...devices,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:06.740" end="00:12:10.290">for example, the roundtable one hundred device that we...enterprise connect about</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.290" end="00:12:15.240">a month ago and also into a variety of appliances which allow you to do everything from support</p>
      <p begin="00:12:15.240" end="00:12:20.050">...as part of the broadcastbusiness or being able to do things like, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:20.050" end="00:12:24.810">a brand survivability appliance so really building very broad ecosystem of users in a</p>
      <p begin="00:12:24.810" end="00:12:28.680">partners...really looking for you is developers to be able to participate in that</p>
      <p begin="00:12:28.680" end="00:12:34.380">ecosystem and help drive and grow it now the way that we're going to drive this today is we're very excited</p>
      <p begin="00:12:34.380" end="00:12:39.380">really start with how we help you build experiences on the web there's actually three different places that</p>
      <p begin="00:12:39.380" end="00:12:42.500">we're going to focus on the sky button the...</p>
      <p begin="00:12:42.500" end="00:12:47.390">your eyes and the new scribe web sdk which we're going to have very excited to talk about and</p>
      <p begin="00:12:47.390" end="00:12:53.370">we'll have three come up and just a minute to give you some more details on that now...talk about schedulers and</p>
      <p begin="00:12:53.370" end="00:12:58.340">...button this is a capabilities actually is available today for you to be able to use</p>
      <p begin="00:12:58.340" end="00:13:02.320">allows a very quickly start calls and chats through your local scape</p>
      <p begin="00:13:02.320" end="00:13:07.090">coit from your app or your website now what this means is that you're using the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:07.090" end="00:13:09.980">best of the device but you're able to very quickly and programmatic</p>
      <p begin="00:13:09.980" end="00:13:13.790">...drive that you have some control with your eyes so this allows you</p>
      <p begin="00:13:13.790" end="00:13:16.330">...easily bringing capabilities such as being able</p>
      <p begin="00:13:16.330" end="00:13:20.290">to audio calls from inside of your experience being able to actually start video</p>
      <p begin="00:13:20.290" end="00:13:24.640">...being able to actually do messaging to either singular multi-party</p>
      <p begin="00:13:24.640" end="00:13:29.020">but also allows you do all this dynamically so as part of establishing us through some</p>
      <p begin="00:13:29.020" end="00:13:31.930">simple javascript inside of your site the ability for</p>
      <p begin="00:13:31.930" end="00:13:36.460">you to be able to now have this dynamically driven through the data that you're bringing</p>
      <p begin="00:13:36.460" end="00:13:41.740">into your presentation so this is a great way to get started very quickly with being able start to</p>
      <p begin="00:13:41.740" end="00:13:47.450">...web experience so let me show you just some quick examples of how that's going to come together I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:13:47.450" end="00:13:50.150">going-to go ahead and show you.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:50.150" end="00:14:09.680">A couple things and interestingly enough I'm actually going to...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:11.670">...which that over great.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.670" end="00:14:15.700">So, here you see I've actually got of five see iphone and you can see the got my</p>
      <p begin="00:14:15.700" end="00:14:19.780">...client up now you see the actually have a new message from a friend of mine</p>
      <p begin="00:14:19.780" end="00:14:22.790">data so when I look at data you can actually see that</p>
      <p begin="00:14:22.790" end="00:14:26.860">when I'm doing this I can go ahead and see the information and...actually</p>
      <p begin="00:14:26.860" end="00:14:31.540">...this nice little video message here that I'm able to sort of pull together and this is a</p>
      <p begin="00:14:31.540" end="00:14:37.170">...some of the rich messaging I can now do with scape information directly off of here</p>
      <p begin="00:14:37.170" end="00:14:42.030">now the process of pulling together some of the messages I actually also have the ability to now be able</p>
      <p begin="00:14:42.030" end="00:14:55.490">to other types of information that she's presented for me.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:55.490" end="00:14:59.310">Now one of the things that she sent me is actually...mushoo.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:59.310" end="00:15:04.020">So, this is actually a link that she was able to forward to me and you'll notice that because the iphone I</p>
      <p begin="00:15:04.020" end="00:15:08.580">was able to actually navigate inside now you can see here that this is actually using the new url</p>
      <p begin="00:15:08.580" end="00:15:13.410">preview capability that we recently announced actually just last week for being able to actually</p>
      <p begin="00:15:13.410" end="00:15:18.280">...information that have richer views inside of this guy client my ability to send these is</p>
      <p begin="00:15:18.280" end="00:15:21.660">actually going to become very interesting because now as a partner I can after</p>
      <p begin="00:15:21.660" end="00:15:24.520">the put information and tag my site in similar ways that I would</p>
      <p begin="00:15:24.520" end="00:15:28.890">...previews and other social networks people now have...information short very richly</p>
      <p begin="00:15:28.890" end="00:15:33.230">inside the scope client as part of that when I navigate to you can see that actually have a custom</p>
      <p begin="00:15:33.230" end="00:15:37.000">view...this custom view...now we have the ability sort of see the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:37.000" end="00:15:41.320">...but actually have a call button now in this call but...</p>
      <p begin="00:15:41.320" end="00:15:46.170">mobile site this actually gives me the ability to actually make this call directly from here so I can go</p>
      <p begin="00:15:46.170" end="00:15:50.280">ahead you notice that actual allows me to call out directly the client there's a particular bug in</p>
      <p begin="00:15:50.280" end="00:15:55.310">this particular client so I'm going to sort of go past that but to give you a sense of</p>
      <p begin="00:15:55.310" end="00:16:04.740">...that looks like for use the developer now let me go ahead and show you the same exact site.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:04.740" end="00:16:08.780">A...see experience but in this case I'm now using inside my modern browser and you can see the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:08.780" end="00:16:13.340">got the same call I got the same...inside of my bottom browser you can see I've got my</p>
      <p begin="00:16:13.340" end="00:16:16.630">...client sort of driven here and from clicking on this list</p>
      <p begin="00:16:16.630" end="00:16:21.080">that I can easily go ahead and actually automate my calling directly into deep linking into the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:21.080" end="00:16:25.740">...client so that ability to actually make that call.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:25.740" end="00:16:29.160">You'll notice that I can go ahead and complete that call so this could be a small business</p>
      <p begin="00:16:29.160" end="00:16:33.560">this could be any number of people that maybe don't have a full phone infrastructure but...ready to use this</p>
      <p begin="00:16:33.560" end="00:16:38.360">guy client directly...that what's important here is that I didn't have to add this business into my</p>
      <p begin="00:16:38.360" end="00:16:41.870">...contacts in order to complete that call.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:41.870" end="00:16:46.220">What you see here is actually example of how you very quickly pulled together assets from</p>
      <p begin="00:16:46.220" end="00:16:51.360">scribe to be able to make that happen now how did that actually come about let me show you the sort</p>
      <p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:56.080">of market from this page you can see here that in fact I've got a few things that are going on</p>
      <p begin="00:16:56.080" end="00:17:02.720">so one of the things is that you can see I've actually added some meta tag fear at the top?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:02.720" end="00:17:07.670">In standard sort of model and when I add...meta tag you can see that shows, for example, price?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:07.670" end="00:17:11.970">And, other information that now url preview will pick up automatically</p>
      <p begin="00:17:11.970" end="00:17:16.640">...are the same tags that you would populate for being able to populate your url preview in twitter</p>
      <p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:21.090">and facebook and other social sites so the ability to sort of make those tags now allows</p>
      <p begin="00:17:21.090" end="00:17:25.590">you to pick that rich data up in scape directly and you'll notice that as part of being able</p>
      <p begin="00:17:25.590" end="00:17:31.160">to load this that I'm actually able to program that button directly</p>
      <p begin="00:17:31.160" end="00:17:36.150">inside the script so you notice that I have my ability to load the function in this case it's the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:36.150" end="00:17:39.530">...dot you...function...have the ability to actually.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:40.660" end="00:17:43.460">Configure sort of what that...going to be who is going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:17:43.460" end="00:17:45.780">...you'll notice that actually passing in programmatic</p>
      <p begin="00:17:45.780" end="00:17:50.530">...the value for the sky by the that I'm using in that particular case so in this case calling north</p>
      <p begin="00:17:50.530" end="00:17:53.690">...traitors so that ability for me to programmatic</p>
      <p begin="00:17:53.690" end="00:17:58.560">...bring that skate calling directly in my site have that button driven have automate and work</p>
      <p begin="00:17:58.560" end="00:18:03.120">across different platforms is a great opportunity how you today you can start to take advantage of doing</p>
      <p begin="00:18:03.120" end="00:18:10.170">...now this is a great place that we think for people to start in the sort of gets comfortable with</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.170" end="00:18:14.240">...of the idea of bringing...sky but we know that there's more that we can do so</p>
      <p begin="00:18:14.240" end="00:18:18.580">part of that is making sure that we can let you...take the best of the device and the best</p>
      <p begin="00:18:18.580" end="00:18:23.510">of the cloud together and the root of that is really about being able to take a very restful</p>
      <p begin="00:18:23.510" end="00:18:28.880">services based approach to how we're thinking about development going forward so whether we think about this</p>
      <p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:30.630">says is obviously being able to take those three</p>
      <p begin="00:18:30.630" end="00:18:34.970">...connected users and the wide sort of range of...that we get with</p>
      <p begin="00:18:34.970" end="00:18:39.920">scat for business being able to bring that to...many platforms as we possibly can</p>
      <p begin="00:18:39.920" end="00:18:43.830">be able to do this in a way that allows us to work for both the cloud and from premises</p>
      <p begin="00:18:43.830" end="00:18:47.570">...for hybrid and being able to actually do this in a way that is great</p>
      <p begin="00:18:47.570" end="00:18:50.730">for mobile allows you to actually move very quickly</p>
      <p begin="00:18:50.730" end="00:18:56.250">and innovate very rapidly through this model so as we bring this out then this is really about</p>
      <p begin="00:18:56.250" end="00:19:00.800">how we start to build-out on the actual development of the platform is powered by</p>
      <p begin="00:19:00.800" end="00:19:04.850">...service and services and we have implementation that we've done with our first</p>
      <p begin="00:19:04.850" end="00:19:09.640">party clients today which is using our restful base services</p>
      <p begin="00:19:09.640" end="00:19:14.570">an object models that were delivering in our mobile clients right now and really the core</p>
      <p begin="00:19:14.570" end="00:19:18.580">that is the stressful service and like...restful services you'll see that</p>
      <p begin="00:19:18.580" end="00:19:22.920">this is fundamentally about delivering that experience for being audio from your app to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:22.920" end="00:19:26.670">our server now as a real-time application one of the key things that you</p>
      <p begin="00:19:26.670" end="00:19:30.330">...here is that this isn't just about resources and getting</p>
      <p begin="00:19:30.330" end="00:19:35.230">inputting resources on the web is also about being able to have notification channels that you can</p>
      <p begin="00:19:35.230" end="00:19:39.850">actually be able to drive so whether this is about verifications from the client or</p>
      <p begin="00:19:39.850" end="00:19:44.360">...get this from another service and point in the cloud you want to make sure that you can bring both of these things</p>
      <p begin="00:19:44.360" end="00:19:50.110">together so the framework facilitates both of those aspects now in addition to that</p>
      <p begin="00:19:50.110" end="00:19:53.450">your ability now historically has been to basically write your own client</p>
      <p begin="00:19:53.450" end="00:19:57.040">rappers for these restful services if you're writing a service and point you're</p>
      <p begin="00:19:57.040" end="00:20:01.550">going to having to again write your own sort of manage code whether it's java csharp</p>
      <p begin="00:20:01.550" end="00:20:05.910">etc we're starting with this is to build these...to give you a set</p>
      <p begin="00:20:05.910" end="00:20:10.160">of new capabilities and this is really where we're talking about the introduction of the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:10.160" end="00:20:15.810">...web sdk so...web sdk allows you to have a first party platform</p>
      <p begin="00:20:15.810" end="00:20:20.300">with your third-party experience because you're building on the exact same services that</p>
      <p begin="00:20:20.300" end="00:20:24.780">were building on to build the first party products so the object models the api</p>
      <p begin="00:20:24.780" end="00:20:29.870">is the wrestle services these are the things that we're using to build-out the sky clients for</p>
      <p begin="00:20:29.870" end="00:20:35.430">...for business moving forward now what this means is that we're giving you the intro with</p>
      <p begin="00:20:35.430" end="00:20:40.340">the scribe web sdk preview to be able to start building these experiences into your web</p>
      <p begin="00:20:40.340" end="00:20:43.580">experiences that let-you stay productive in your experiences.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:44.920" end="00:20:49.830">With the release that we have today with the preview we are introducing capabilities for chat</p>
      <p begin="00:20:49.830" end="00:20:52.020">and presence the ability to contact</p>
      <p begin="00:20:52.020" end="00:20:56.730">management search for people and groups the ability to scale from both one-one</p>
      <p begin="00:20:56.730" end="00:21:01.420">calls up to conferencing the ability to have rich audio video again including</p>
      <p begin="00:21:01.420" end="00:21:06.220">sort-of one-to-one and multi-party introducing a new model for beagle to pass application</p>
      <p begin="00:21:06.220" end="00:21:10.810">context which is again sort of extending beyond just the simple configuration</p>
      <p begin="00:21:10.810" end="00:21:14.570">base production being able to take context from your website include that when you</p>
      <p begin="00:21:14.570" end="00:21:19.700">initialize the conversation this will continue to improve and in fact our approach with the</p>
      <p begin="00:21:19.700" end="00:21:24.220">scribe web sdk is actually continue to innovate on this very rapidly so this</p>

      <p begin="00:22:22.160" end="00:22:26.990">...fantastic so now that we're set up here I'm going to talk about the scenario and</p>
      <p begin="00:22:26.990" end="00:22:30.120">...the scenario is I am a customer I'm on</p>
      <p begin="00:22:30.120" end="00:22:34.320">...web page over here and I'm trying to shop...for example, and,</p>

      <p begin="00:22:39.780" end="00:22:45.270">running experiences that I need and for me to do that I'm going to show</p>
      <p begin="00:22:45.270" end="00:22:51.000">you this scenario end-to-end to enable you to figure out how easy it is</p>
      <p begin="00:22:51.000" end="00:22:55.910">for me as a...customer to make the connection to an agent</p>
      <p begin="00:22:55.910" end="00:23:01.080">on have a...expedient right there so we're going to be I'm going to</p>

      <p begin="00:23:09.570" end="00:23:13.260">going-to try to customize my shoes now to see what works for me cyclic on the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:13.260" end="00:23:18.180">customize who that's nice you I think I can and training for like a running</p>

      <p begin="00:23:32.220" end="00:23:34.160">So, right that immediately when you're</p>
      <p begin="00:23:34.160" end="00:23:39.420">building your website you can actually see that you could embed a</p>
      <p begin="00:23:39.420" end="00:23:43.440">...experience so that you can actually call out</p>
      <p begin="00:23:43.440" end="00:23:46.730">...customer service agent non the customer here and I'm thinking</p>

      <p begin="00:23:49.700" end="00:23:54.790">or not and I'm seeing that I could actually make an interactive causal an age and,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:54.790" end="00:23:55.890">it's free</p>
      <p begin="00:23:55.890" end="00:24:01.880">because it's bauer via scape here so let me just go ahead and click next.</p>

      <p begin="00:24:32.720" end="00:24:37.280">I go ahead and I picked up my shoe color...checking out let's say I think</p>
      <p begin="00:24:37.280" end="00:24:42.040">...medium arch over here and I go I probably would do about</p>
      <p begin="00:24:42.040" end="00:24:46.350">twenty five over twenty five miles so now directly I'm talking over</p>
      <p begin="00:24:46.350" end="00:24:50.010">to my customer agent obviously manages right here on my stage here</p>
      <p begin="00:24:50.010" end="00:24:54.570">...kind of very difficult to talk on the screen but high-demand can you tell me this is the right</p>
      <p begin="00:24:54.570" end="00:25:00.010">...for me scenario...you have two more than twenty five miles</p>
      <p begin="00:25:00.010" end="00:25:04.480">setting your screen if you look at the...that you have configured I see the you</p>
      <p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:07.830">have offloading trails usually for going to go the distance it's more</p>
      <p begin="00:25:07.830" end="00:25:12.050">likely be rotor track is that correct yes okay...and get that</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.050" end="00:25:16.430">...over for you now as I'm interacting with the user I can see on</p>
      <p begin="00:25:16.430" end="00:25:21.320">my screen what chains are being made and I can actually adjust what she's saying on her screen as well</p>
      <p begin="00:25:21.320" end="00:25:25.810">so truly collaborative interactive experience that were able to have with each other as we're going through</p>

      <p begin="00:25:28.380" end="00:25:32.770">...so the bind that I'm trying to make here is that all that context of being</p>

      <p begin="00:25:41.320" end="00:25:46.110">...right there there's not that extra channel that you need to build</p>
      <p begin="00:25:46.110" end="00:25:48.900">...create in order to have this would be a very natural</p>
      <p begin="00:25:50.700" end="00:25:54.380">...experience of...using this decay so now</p>
      <p begin="00:25:54.380" end="00:25:59.600">...were done thank you none for being the agent and helping me out with it so I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:03.010">to come out of this demo and we're going to talk a little bit about</p>
      <p begin="00:26:03.010" end="00:26:05.610">the about the experience from a</p>
      <p begin="00:26:05.610" end="00:26:17.310">...perspective over here so you want...this...lower.</p>

      <p begin="00:26:21.110" end="00:26:23.770">So, then obviously he's a partner he</p>
      <p begin="00:26:23.770" end="00:26:29.760">...the clarity consulting and do you want to talk about the your company and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:34.330">what the products that you will term absolutely so I'm not always function as an agent answering</p>
      <p begin="00:26:34.330" end="00:26:38.320">calls I also manage the development on...to connect now clearly</p>
      <p begin="00:26:38.320" end="00:26:42.050">...is extent a product extends the functionality of the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:42.050" end="00:26:46.160">...application which is really fantastic for two-party and conference calls</p>
      <p begin="00:26:46.160" end="00:26:48.820">but we connect does extend that to be able to perform</p>

      <p begin="00:27:01.100" end="00:27:05.700">wants to be connected to and then when the customer through a intelligent routing</p>
      <p begin="00:27:05.700" end="00:27:10.290">...the agent that's most likely to be able to answer their questions now because we're completely</p>
      <p begin="00:27:10.290" end="00:27:14.510">meta with skylight when the agent receives that message from the customer they see</p>

      <p begin="00:27:31.710" end="00:27:36.180">...context added about call now in addition the information about the</p>
      <p begin="00:27:36.180" end="00:27:41.390">color that can help...figure out there issue and we also had functionality...certain</p>
      <p begin="00:27:41.390" end="00:27:43.970">...types of transfers and call control functionality as</p>
      <p begin="00:27:43.970" end="00:27:47.860">...someone specific to customer care solutions so we're able to</p>
      <p begin="00:27:47.860" end="00:27:52.550">...course can functionality with those additional pieces?</p>
      <p begin="00:27:52.550" end="00:27:58.170">Thank you...you also briefly show us how you of being able to use...investigate...</p>
      <p begin="00:27:58.170" end="00:28:03.500">and absolutely so unless which...screen here so one thing that clearly connectors has</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.500" end="00:28:07.920">...had a huge focus on over its entire six-year existence is giving the agent the best</p>
      <p begin="00:28:07.920" end="00:28:12.700">experience possible because we found is when the agent has a good experience...able to make sure</p>
      <p begin="00:28:12.700" end="00:28:17.560">the customer also has a good experience so one thing that I'm really excited about that we're going to pushing</p>
      <p begin="00:28:17.560" end="00:28:22.860">out in just a couple months is a brand-new html five dashboard this is a single page application,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:22.860" end="00:28:26.350">application that's built using angular with signal...the back-end</p>
      <p begin="00:28:26.350" end="00:28:31.190">and provides a real-time view of what's happening everywhere and...customer care center I can look</p>
      <p begin="00:28:31.190" end="00:28:34.130">...each q and this way I can proactively see</p>
      <p begin="00:28:34.130" end="00:28:38.970">okay looks like accounts receivables having some problems and allocates more resources and make sure</p>
      <p begin="00:28:38.970" end="00:28:42.850">the customers are all going to be having a good experience without having to get complaints</p>
      <p begin="00:28:42.850" end="00:28:46.030">from customers first so what we wanted to try with the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:46.030" end="00:28:50.040">...for web sdk is see if we can build that same experience that's completely</p>
      <p begin="00:28:50.040" end="00:28:54.560">customized around what the agency need to be able to see but rather than just doing</p>
      <p begin="00:28:54.560" end="00:28:58.800">it when and when monitoring the contact center also have that when you're interacting</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58.800" end="00:29:03.660">with the customer so we did is built into this a same application a full</p>
      <p begin="00:29:03.660" end="00:29:08.360">...client that's based on the scope web sdk so I'm go ahead and ask</p>
      <p begin="00:29:08.360" end="00:29:13.350">a shreveport to function as the customer now so switching roles little bit and put them</p>
      <p begin="00:29:13.350" end="00:29:18.140">a call and this...can be routed through clarity can act and it's going to be connected to this</p>
      <p begin="00:29:18.140" end="00:29:21.530">agent to go and place calling thank you then I'm going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:29:21.530" end="00:29:27.030">back as the customer again looking at the same shoes?</p>
      <p begin="00:29:27.030" end="00:29:28.760">So, as the agents I can now see</p>
      <p begin="00:29:28.760" end="00:29:33.450">...call coming in who it's coming from and some information about them as soon as I...</p>
      <p begin="00:29:33.450" end="00:29:38.180">that I have a new...the pops up on my screen I can still go back and look at all the other</p>
      <p begin="00:29:38.180" end="00:29:41.770">cues and see what's happening there but I'm now interacting with the customer</p>
      <p begin="00:29:41.770" end="00:29:47.140">and if a new my audio should get some delightful feedback.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:47.140" end="00:29:48.830">...somewhere so,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:48.830" end="00:29:53.290">I now have a whole bunch of information about the customer I have...about the tickets may have opened</p>
      <p begin="00:29:53.290" end="00:29:58.710">crm information I have what options they chose as a navigated through the...the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.710" end="00:30:03.600">in semesters channel but the important thing I want to point out is the operate hand corner there is the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:07.010">core control buttons now with the agent doesn't need to know is that</p>
      <p begin="00:30:07.010" end="00:30:11.180">they're actually doing completely different things the mute button is interacting with the...</p>
      <p begin="00:30:11.180" end="00:30:16.920">scope web sdk to...audio the whole bugging interacting with the...to connect back-end so</p>
      <p begin="00:30:16.920" end="00:30:21.670">that we have control over what music is being played the user and what and we have more information about</p>
      <p begin="00:30:21.670" end="00:30:24.760">metrics so we contract how long each customers on hold and</p>
      <p begin="00:30:24.760" end="00:30:28.620">maybe correlate that with the customer satisfaction with conversation from</p>
      <p begin="00:30:28.620" end="00:30:32.590">...perspective it's a single unify set of controls that are all going to</p>
      <p begin="00:30:32.590" end="00:30:36.230">be in a single space now if I'm not able to answer the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:36.230" end="00:30:40.700">customers question I can use the same sky clients sdk</p>
      <p begin="00:30:40.700" end="00:30:44.470">...search so if I want to bring up say somebody</p>
      <p begin="00:30:44.470" end="00:30:49.180">...dan that I think can help me with this question I have the full sdk ability</p>
      <p begin="00:30:49.180" end="00:30:52.940">to have interactive presence...all the different endpoints that user</p>
      <p begin="00:30:52.940" end="00:30:56.720">...have established and it's really exactly the same as using</p>
      <p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:31:02.040">standard clients now we're starting to get interesting is we can also introduce additional</p>
      <p begin="00:31:02.040" end="00:31:03.570">things if I can type</p>
      <p begin="00:31:03.570" end="00:31:08.240">correctly and since we have control over the client we can also inject things that are sprinkler</p>
      <p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:13.440">to connect specific so in...to contacts I can say I can see</p>
      <p begin="00:31:13.440" end="00:31:17.980">...person to instead I can see the so what support qi probably shun send</p>
      <p begin="00:31:17.980" end="00:31:21.840">the customer to iq because there's nobody available and she's...waiting on hold for</p>
      <p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:27.190">a while so all this is available because we have complete control...your over the user interface</p>
      <p begin="00:31:27.190" end="00:31:31.770">that specifically tailored around what the customer needs to be able to see?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:31.770" end="00:31:34.610">Now if I am able to handle the conversation but I want to make sure it</p>
      <p begin="00:31:34.610" end="00:31:39.540">to truly personal experience what I can do is we can trigger some video and</p>
      <p begin="00:31:39.540" end="00:31:42.830">again we're not using find...all this is all exclusively over the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:42.830" end="00:31:47.250">...sdk and we can have interactive audio video and instant messaging</p>
      <p begin="00:31:47.250" end="00:31:52.870">all going through just the client this is one example of a way that you can use the sdk to really bring a</p>
      <p begin="00:31:52.870" end="00:31:57.780">...experience that you may not be able to get with the client because you have the standard controls that</p>
      <p begin="00:31:57.780" end="00:32:02.070">are always going to be there were really excited to get this out in a product we can push out</p>
      <p begin="00:32:02.070" end="00:32:06.560">we can't wait to hear what...customers have to say about it thank you then.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:06.560" end="00:32:14.790">I'm going...the powerpoint.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:14.790" end="00:32:17.480">Awesome so you heard so far on</p>
      <p begin="00:32:17.480" end="00:32:20.160">what are the experiences you can build</p>
      <p begin="00:32:20.160" end="00:32:24.500">...this type of instigate now let's talk a little bit about what</p>
      <p begin="00:32:24.500" end="00:32:27.260">...this scribe...so if you look at</p>
      <p begin="00:32:27.260" end="00:32:31.070">this screen over there you have your application experience you have</p>
      <p begin="00:32:31.070" end="00:32:37.160">your html and your javascript that's powering...custom experience which is what the</p>
      <p begin="00:32:37.160" end="00:32:42.180">done hedges demoted right now what you're doing is adding a reference to this the best</p>
      <p begin="00:32:42.180" end="00:32:44.790">...directly and we'll talk in detail</p>
      <p begin="00:32:44.790" end="00:32:49.650">about exactly how you do it and what are the steps and how do you get started so you can just go home today</p>
      <p begin="00:32:49.650" end="00:32:54.310">pick-up your laptop and start a stop playing around with it so we have and</p>
      <p begin="00:32:54.310" end="00:32:58.400">...break down a little bit and what is inside of the...as</p>
      <p begin="00:32:58.400" end="00:33:03.180">...and...you'll you how you would have a bunch of ux controls you have a</p>
      <p begin="00:33:03.180" end="00:33:08.900">bunch of javascript object model and interfaces and in order to</p>
      <p begin="00:33:08.900" end="00:33:12.820">...experience overall you have the media...the signaling the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:12.820" end="00:33:17.790">odf provider so on and a little bit one level deeper?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:17.790" end="00:33:21.000">Media provider let's talk a little bit about it so we support</p>
      <p begin="00:33:21.000" end="00:33:23.790">me we have media providers to support a bunch</p>
      <p begin="00:33:23.790" end="00:33:28.070">of type capabilities including audio video and sharing</p>
      <p begin="00:33:28.070" end="00:33:31.400">scribe is not just about video it's about the entire experience that of</p>
      <p begin="00:33:31.400" end="00:33:37.420">communicating...one percent of the other person we also have.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:37.420" end="00:33:41.240">The our of the sky back-end that...using the http</p>
      <p begin="00:33:41.240" end="00:33:45.980">address services that are lighting up this lighting of this experience and we have identity</p>
      <p begin="00:33:45.980" end="00:33:50.660">providers that would work with your identity provider or this type of type of business identity</p>
      <p begin="00:33:50.660" end="00:33:57.400">providers in this one more additional piece of information isfor the media providers</p>
      <p begin="00:33:57.400" end="00:34:02.400">...are supporting this type of business web up again this type plug-in as well as</p>
      <p begin="00:34:02.400" end="00:34:06.110">the web rtc going forward.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:06.110" end="00:34:08.300">Now that you've seen the overall picture this type of</p>
      <p begin="00:34:08.300" end="00:34:12.990">...decay let's see what is available in the preview for you so for the preview that's</p>
      <p begin="00:34:12.990" end="00:34:17.880">the one that you can actually take home with you or done download and play around with it today is we are</p>
      <p begin="00:34:17.880" end="00:34:22.010">exposing the javascript object model interfaces that's exactly what we're done</p>
      <p begin="00:34:22.010" end="00:34:27.460">have leverage for his custom experience there and we are providing this type of business</p>
      <p begin="00:34:27.460" end="00:34:32.380">...plug-in as well that you could use...of your scenarios.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:32.380" end="00:34:35.930">So, getting started...an interesting.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:35.930" end="00:34:37.490">Couple of pieces of information</p>
      <p begin="00:34:37.490" end="00:34:42.470">one thing where it's a javascript library but word we're going to be hosting it</p>
      <p begin="00:34:42.470" end="00:34:47.340">...in this type...for a couple of reasons one you</p>
      <p begin="00:34:47.340" end="00:34:51.110">get the reliability that it as there it's hosted by</p>
      <p begin="00:34:51.110" end="00:34:57.240">...type and it's always available and the second thing is you don't</p>
      <p begin="00:34:57.240" end="00:35:01.020">have to worry about getting and hosting it locally testing it out</p>
      <p begin="00:35:01.020" end="00:35:06.920">and all that good stuff it's already there and you can just move forward with it now let me introduce you to</p>
      <p begin="00:35:06.920" end="00:35:10.440">...a few key concepts overhear application,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:10.440" end="00:35:14.750">application is the basically the entry point into the web sdk it's a</p>
      <p begin="00:35:14.750" end="00:35:18.430">...object that has a reference to everything</p>
      <p begin="00:35:18.430" end="00:35:22.000">the every experience that you need to light up how do you get to</p>
      <p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:27.390">this application so this is what this is what is going to be inside of your</p>
      <p begin="00:35:27.390" end="00:35:30.830">goal is this is basically I'm going to show you in the visual syria's web design</p>
      <p begin="00:35:30.830" end="00:35:35.470">...going to be rationing do you are referent to these type of</p>
      <p begin="00:35:35.470" end="00:35:40.630">sdk and specifically the reason this is important is the api key is that</p>
      <p begin="00:35:40.630" end="00:35:45.450">...are going to be using for the public preview that is available at the conference today</p>
      <p begin="00:35:45.450" end="00:35:48.880">...moving on?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:52.490">Little bit more drilling into the key...so we have the application</p>
      <p begin="00:35:53.510" end="00:35:58.360">...this book about that and we have four major areas you can think about that are coming out of</p>
      <p begin="00:35:58.360" end="00:36:01.770">this application you have the sign-in you have you have the</p>
      <p begin="00:36:01.770" end="00:36:06.470">presence and groups you have the conversation and you have the devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:06.470" end="00:36:10.340">This is what helps you...sign-in and sign up sign</p>
      <p begin="00:36:10.340" end="00:36:15.590">...sign in sign-out as well as state and this will is going to be a first entry point into the</p>
      <p begin="00:36:15.590" end="00:36:20.570">into the experience persons and groups this will give you the data that you just</p>
      <p begin="00:36:20.570" end="00:36:25.120">sign the screens today which is hey what's this person's name what's that what's</p>
      <p begin="00:36:25.120" end="00:36:27.160">the presence state...over here what's</p>
      <p begin="00:36:27.160" end="00:36:31.640">...the nodal contact for all that information is what's going to be lighted of</p>
      <p begin="00:36:31.640" end="00:36:35.160">overhear as well as the list of contact the</p>
      <p begin="00:36:35.160" end="00:36:41.700">done was just able to show for you is all...be coming out of this particular this particular concept</p>
      <p begin="00:36:41.700" end="00:36:46.000">conversations manager primarily this is what how words your connectivity annual</p>
      <p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:50.210">conversations your chat sessions your audio sessions your video</p>
      <p begin="00:36:50.210" end="00:36:55.050">sessions and eventually or sharing is all going to be powered by of this one devices is actually</p>
      <p begin="00:36:55.050" end="00:37:00.850">the manager...hardware devices of camera microphone as well as your</p>
      <p begin="00:37:00.850" end="00:37:09.100">speakers.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:09.100" end="00:37:14.170">So, this is sort of they the flow that you can think about...just spoke about it but</p>
      <p begin="00:37:14.170" end="00:37:18.950">...look at it visual in here the one...the few...that I want to make...at</p>
      <p begin="00:37:18.950" end="00:37:23.910">...me person object and the participant object all of them give you</p>
      <p begin="00:37:23.910" end="00:37:28.820">the information about the contact and how do you use it conversation</p>
      <p begin="00:37:28.820" end="00:37:32.680">...our you the audio...and your</p>
      <p begin="00:37:32.680" end="00:37:39.130">im chat service as well as your sharing going forward and it also has references</p>
      <p begin="00:37:39.130" end="00:37:44.090">...history...history which will story...I am conversations</p>
      <p begin="00:37:44.090" end="00:37:45.720">...played in and</p>
      <p begin="00:37:45.720" end="00:37:57.010">show them around so having said that I'm going to show a few more things over here?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:57.010" end="00:38:02.040">Awesome so I'm going to show you how to get started.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:02.040" end="00:38:05.770">All the concept of the demos good that you need to get your hands.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:05.770" end="00:38:09.280">And, get on this one so.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:17.090">So, let's do this how do you go and get what you mean.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:17.090" end="00:38:22.260">Another bernard scribe dot com that's...new portland or that's a portal it's got all the latest</p>
      <p begin="00:38:22.260" end="00:38:26.270">and greatest information for you have the building with scribe.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:26.270" end="00:38:31.350">Go over there and over here it has the pieces that</p>
      <p begin="00:38:31.350" end="00:38:34.710">...spoken about and it's got data about the web</p>
      <p begin="00:38:34.710" end="00:38:39.560">...so this is the length that you would need to go to in order to go get what you want</p>
      <p begin="00:38:39.560" end="00:38:43.220">we have the samples of be showing you some of the samples over here and,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:43.220" end="00:38:46.690">kind of walk through some of them and should be able to go</p>
      <p begin="00:38:46.690" end="00:38:50.700">ahead downloaded and play around with it so?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50.700" end="00:38:54.600">These are the samples hosted them locally on my machine I have</p>
      <p begin="00:38:54.600" end="00:39:10.620">my own topology I'm going-to go ahead and try design and using microbiology here.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:10.620" end="00:39:16.100">Awesome so sign-in is done.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:16.100" end="00:39:20.910">The reason I'm showing this samples I'm going to switch back a little bit...studio...kind</p>
      <p begin="00:39:20.910" end="00:39:27.140">of show you exactly what...the lines that are powering so this is the this is basically this is</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.140" end="00:39:31.920">the particular sample that you give you how do you view the person's...presence, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:31.920" end="00:39:40.590">I can go ahead change my.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:40.590" end="00:39:44.320">And, I can go ahead and change...</p>
      <p begin="00:39:44.320" end="00:39:49.220">Prisms over here by the...just on the connecting the point over there</p>
      <p begin="00:39:49.220" end="00:39:55.510">done here is helping out with this with the demo by being the other</p>
      <p begin="00:39:55.510" end="00:39:59.280">...dander you see any change I can see the cassie just change to available and has</p>
      <p begin="00:39:59.280" end="00:40:03.410">build conference internet awesome fantastic?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:03.410" end="00:40:07.210">So, I can go ahead and show you that.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:07.210" end="00:40:11.660">...the exact same code that done was using is you just given a</p>
      <p begin="00:40:11.660" end="00:40:14.920">...name or you just given the search</p>
      <p begin="00:40:14.920" end="00:40:19.910">...strings that...need...you the list of information is the same thing the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:19.910" end="00:40:32.550">...using over there as well same thing I can show you a few more for example.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:32.550" end="00:40:34.780">So, that now display the all-day</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.780" end="00:40:40.080">information for a particular contact this is the this is the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:40.080" end="00:40:47.190">...that's being powered by the participants over.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:47.190" end="00:40:50.590">In the previous slides so let me go ahead and click to the name</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.590" end="00:40:54.520">and presence information over here.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:54.520" end="00:40:59.840">And, done...our status over...go and change my presence too busy.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:59.840" end="00:41:04.830">And, as soon as that replicate out.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:04.830" end="00:41:08.650">...understates as being able to change disease...you have basically the point is if you have</p>
      <p begin="00:41:08.650" end="00:41:13.160">your own environment you can go ahead and just deployed get started right away</p>
      <p begin="00:41:13.160" end="00:41:17.710">and the local host have a couple of users and start playing around with it looks through the sample</p>
      <p begin="00:41:17.710" end="00:41:20.090">...figure out how-to-do-it the same</p>
      <p begin="00:41:20.090" end="00:41:32.140">way I'm just going to show one more before research into the code...the interest of time.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:32.140" end="00:41:36.430">Awesome so again this is the...conversational there.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:36.430" end="00:41:40.360">One-time something...</p>
      <p begin="00:41:40.360" end="00:41:44.710">Thank you done so basically it has everything that you need to get started</p>
      <p begin="00:41:44.710" end="00:41:49.450">...a slight change and look at how the code is actually our</p>
      <p begin="00:41:49.450" end="00:41:55.030">over here so I mentioned a few key concepts over here.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:55.030" end="00:41:58.760">That's the first one that I mention one kind of make sure that I'm able to</p>
      <p begin="00:41:58.760" end="00:42:02.700">highlighted is that is hosted for-you the...hosted</p>
      <p begin="00:42:02.700" end="00:42:07.550">for you that will download the web sdk ad runtime as soon as you that further</p>
      <p begin="00:42:07.550" end="00:42:19.120">than instantiated the right way using the particular api key that...expose possible conference.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:19.120" end="00:42:22.710">Now that code is also that in the samples of feel free go ahead and use it</p>
      <p begin="00:42:22.710" end="00:42:27.380">is under the scripts folder nestle exactly give you the same</p>
      <p begin="00:42:27.380" end="00:42:30.850">api...that you would need the u.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:30.850" end="00:42:35.580">The next is I'm going to walk through the specific code that we did for some of</p>
      <p begin="00:42:35.580" end="00:42:43.540">the scenarios so that you have...and you can get rolling with it.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:43.540" end="00:42:47.360">The first one we did was basically sign in so</p>
      <p begin="00:42:47.360" end="00:42:52.330">over here what we did is basically this piece of code so we did we went</p>
      <p begin="00:42:52.330" end="00:42:55.460">into the application created a client.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:55.460" end="00:42:56.480">References to the sign</p>
      <p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:01.380">in manager sign in the user name and password and that's it that's basically it</p>
      <p begin="00:43:01.380" end="00:43:08.860">it's very easy to use you should be able to get removing pretty quickly with this one.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:08.860" end="00:43:12.020">Let me show one to...their self,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:12.020" end="00:43:16.900">for example, this is the key concept that I mention about how you can retrieval contacts and</p>

      <p begin="00:43:46.500" end="00:43:51.930">to do is known dot...so you just it's very simple to get started a</p>
      <p begin="00:43:51.930" end="00:43:56.620">couple of lines of code and you should be able to get your functionality over there.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:56.620" end="00:44:02.750">One other thing is let's try to look at the...service over here.</p>

      <p begin="00:44:20.180" end="00:44:22.280">...don't accept.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:22.280" end="00:44:25.480">That's basically it if you want accept the conversation or</p>

      <p begin="00:44:29.840" end="00:44:34.170">the samples we have audio-video sample as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:34.170" end="00:44:38.020">Feel free to go ahead and look added that is a little bit that's a</p>
      <p begin="00:44:38.020" end="00:44:41.770">little more code and there but that basically enable you to do an audio</p>
      <p begin="00:44:41.770" end="00:44:46.450">...conversation just like this the to be pretty simple pretty straightforward</p>
      <p begin="00:44:46.450" end="00:44:51.850">calls over that so I think that's a good introduction for you guys to just get go ahead, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:51.850" end="00:44:54.410">where to go, you know, how to download the...you know-how</p>
      <p begin="00:44:54.410" end="00:45:02.950">...posted...how to reference...how to get moving and with that?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:02.950" end="00:45:07.050">...awesome so with that I'm going to give the stage back to</p>
      <p begin="00:45:07.050" end="00:45:12.600">andy so he can talk about some of the other details...</p>
      <p begin="00:45:12.600" end="00:45:15.560">Official hand-off thank you.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:15.560" end="00:45:20.700">Thank you round of applause for the demos please.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:20.700" end="00:45:25.950">Excellent so, let me just sort of recap exactly what we father</p>
      <p begin="00:45:25.950" end="00:45:30.860">...sdk is javascript working as restful api is the samples basically work against</p>
      <p begin="00:45:30.860" end="00:45:34.320">...demo service that we have up that you guys can all use</p>
      <p begin="00:45:34.320" end="00:45:38.570">...part of downloading the samples we...encourage you to go do the downloading give the samples</p>
      <p begin="00:45:38.570" end="00:45:41.730">a try part of the motivation for being...walk for each of those</p>
      <p begin="00:45:41.730" end="00:45:46.540">particular samples is that it's really going to be your call about sort of what makes sense inside of</p>
      <p begin="00:45:46.540" end="00:45:49.150">your application might be you just one look at presence</p>
      <p begin="00:45:49.150" end="00:45:53.750">...able to set presence may be based on how people walking around or other things that they're doing instead</p>
      <p begin="00:45:53.750" end="00:45:58.410">of your application you might want to be able to intermix presence with video calling or be able</p>
      <p begin="00:45:58.410" end="00:46:03.380">to automate messaging...on how those things are coming together so think of it is really a tool set for you to</p>
      <p begin="00:46:03.380" end="00:46:08.370">be able to combine answer ways that are interesting within the context of your application not just about</p>
      <p begin="00:46:08.370" end="00:46:13.260">sort of any specific sort-of flow that you have to triangle through so I encourage everyone to ville</p>
      <p begin="00:46:13.260" end="00:46:18.260">visit the site I encourage everyone to go check out exactly how the samples can help you started</p>
      <p begin="00:46:18.260" end="00:46:23.240">very good feedback from partner so far people getting started really within the day to very</p>
      <p begin="00:46:23.240" end="00:46:28.680">quickly build the first application so check out developer dot skeptic common give that a shot.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:28.680" end="00:46:31.770">One of the things I want to just sort of come back to real quick was to talk about media</p>
      <p begin="00:46:31.770" end="00:46:36.610">because media is a very interesting hot topic in the real-time space for anyone that's been in this</p>
      <p begin="00:46:36.610" end="00:46:40.380">...aspect for a while, you know, that obviously historically</p>
      <p begin="00:46:40.380" end="00:46:43.740">videos a very tough thing to do over the internet and one of the things that made</p>
      <p begin="00:46:43.740" end="00:46:48.710">...really valuable when it was initially launch back in twenty four twenty five was really</p>
      <p begin="00:46:48.710" end="00:46:54.060">this idea that hey we can do all of this using the our of the pc that's there but really as the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:54.060" end="00:46:58.950">clouds matured networking has ventured the model has matured as well so we've seen standards</p>
      <p begin="00:46:58.950" end="00:47:03.900">like web rtc really start to emerge as a great me way for us to drive video</p>
      <p begin="00:47:03.900" end="00:47:08.550">and very seamless kind of friction free experience but the reality is that web</p>
      <p begin="00:47:08.550" end="00:47:13.430">rtc is developing and even with the web rtc there's still a lot of things that you need to be able to do</p>
      <p begin="00:47:13.430" end="00:47:18.320">to really have a great video experience so part of our model for being able to think about media moving</p>
      <p begin="00:47:18.320" end="00:47:23.180">forward is to have this notion of a media controller that allows you to actually control and really</p>
      <p begin="00:47:23.180" end="00:47:27.270">handle the different media providers that we support sri mention that in fact</p>
      <p begin="00:47:27.270" end="00:47:31.730">windows media providers that we're going to be supporting over the set of previews</p>
      <p begin="00:47:31.730" end="00:47:36.580">...not just the sky for business web out plug-in that's available in the preview today but also the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:36.580" end="00:47:41.130">...plug-in and also in fact is those things kind of converge together really thinking about a</p>
      <p begin="00:47:41.130" end="00:47:45.870">shared media stack that supports the full range of media but also being of</p>
      <p begin="00:47:45.870" end="00:47:49.150">the actually support web rtc media providers host</p>
      <p begin="00:47:49.150" end="00:47:51.900">...providers over the course of time with</p>
      <p begin="00:47:51.900" end="00:47:56.400">our subsequent previews so really this media control gives you a great experience for being able</p>
      <p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:48:00.410">to actually abstract some of those differences whether you're doing video whether you</p>
      <p begin="00:48:00.410" end="00:48:04.850">want to add something more complex like app sharing but it also gives you the ability to have a more</p>
      <p begin="00:48:04.850" end="00:48:09.850">robust model for things like instantiation recovery and feedback and most importantly</p>
      <p begin="00:48:09.850" end="00:48:14.230">it's coordinated with the rest of the singling web rtc does not give you all the signaling</p>
      <p begin="00:48:14.230" end="00:48:19.070">...identity and off pieces that you need to actually bring the entire experience together so really this</p>
      <p begin="00:48:19.070" end="00:48:23.960">is a great opportunity for you be able to get really sort of the best of both worlds the best of the client the best of the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:23.960" end="00:48:29.770">cloud to deliver the communications experiences that you need now really then what we try to show you</p>
      <p begin="00:48:29.770" end="00:48:34.490">...the course of a very quick sort of forty five minutes so far is that</p>
      <p begin="00:48:34.490" end="00:48:39.410">scribe is really sort of driving very aggressively about how we can unlock really</p>
      <p begin="00:48:39.410" end="00:48:43.870">a range of communication capabilities to connect work in life but also the ability for</p>
      <p begin="00:48:43.870" end="00:48:48.760">use developers to take that and run with it and delivered amazing set of new experiences whether</p>
      <p begin="00:48:48.760" end="00:48:53.500">you're doing connecting with friends or whether connecting with your doctor...connecting with</p>
      <p begin="00:48:53.500" end="00:48:57.250">sort of the business around you want that to be the framework that you can use</p>
      <p begin="00:48:57.250" end="00:49:00.220">...on to really take your solutions forward so we</p>
      <p begin="00:49:00.220" end="00:49:04.120">invited to sort of come in and participate in that so with that I'm going to go ahead</p>
      <p begin="00:49:04.120" end="00:49:08.330">and back daniel to talk about sort of how those partner experiences can help accelerate your</p>
      <p begin="00:49:08.330" end="00:49:12.980">business thank you very formal?</p>

      <p begin="00:49:20.120" end="00:49:24.960">have apps based on a versions that we already have in a market likening three-fifteen</p>
      <p begin="00:49:24.960" end="00:49:29.580">just starting to get there applications ready for sky for business if you visiting the ignite</p>
