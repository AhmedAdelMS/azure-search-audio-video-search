      <p begin="00:00:02.100" end="00:00:04.690">All right so I'm live I guess it's difficult to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:04.690" end="00:00:10.850">compete with dinner but try to make it through here all right.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.850" end="00:00:14.500">So, this talk is about developing three-d printing applications and</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.500" end="00:00:20.000">three print in general ...to remind you that there's a evaluation</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.000" end="00:00:24.720">form and we'd like to have you fill it out when the presentation is over.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.720" end="00:00:29.550">With that I'd like to launch write-in start out with our agenda.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.550" end="00:00:31.670">So, three printing...change quite a bit there's a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.670" end="00:00:37.050">opportunities that are presenting themselves at this time lot-of tools.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.050" end="00:00:42.030">...were putting into windows ten we're going to go in-depth about the things that we're doing in windows ten that really</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.030" end="00:00:45.730">helped...developer and today we're going to announce and talk</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.790" end="00:00:52.130">...consortium...consortium is a group of companies have gotten together to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.130" end="00:00:57.520">kinda help improve the file formats that we're going to be using for...printing in the future and then my</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.520" end="00:01:04.320">colleague emmett will be coming up and talking about three-and-a-half consortium in the future of three-d printing.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:08.690">So, that let's launch right into it was really a revolution going on</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.690" end="00:01:12.830">and three printing it's really a great time to be in this</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.830" end="00:01:13.330">career.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.520" end="00:01:18.970">Because three printing is kind of move from a very nation thing a very expensive</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.970" end="00:01:21.760">with making things too</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.760" end="00:01:26.290">much less expensive and works really well for doing short runs</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.290" end="00:01:32.110">and one offs I've been visiting a lot of companies I've seen a lot of what people are doing.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.110" end="00:01:36.820">For instance I visited a company that was manufacturing for automotive</p>
      <p begin="00:01:36.820" end="00:01:41.800">industry and they were making engine blocks of aluminum and they could turn</p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.800" end="00:01:44.370">...four days and it was amazing</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.370" end="00:01:47.260">to see that because in the past.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:47.260" end="00:01:52.190">Somebody would have to make a mold and then they would have to...the engine block the turn-around time for that was</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.190" end="00:01:57.840">about four months so as the iterated through the engine designs they found perhaps</p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:02.840">some area was hot not getting enough cooling and...needed to modify the design they could get a very rapid</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.840" end="00:02:07.030">turn-around so it's interesting to think about now those were the engines that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.030" end="00:02:09.650">were used in production those are...simply.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.650" end="00:02:12.650">Prototype in testing.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:12.650" end="00:02:17.390">three printing is doing today not just turning around the time it's allowing you to do</p>
      <p begin="00:02:17.390" end="00:02:21.820">things that just could that possibly be done before?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:21.820" end="00:02:26.400">I was handed a carburetor throttle body handed it to me</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.400" end="00:02:31.110">...I was shocked it...just a few ounces because the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.110" end="00:02:36.080">entire inside of the structure was hollow and that's something you just can't do with traditional</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.080" end="00:02:40.940">manufacturing techniques so there is a revolution in the making and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:40.940" end="00:02:46.830">I think it's going to be very interesting what's, what's happening somewhere break this down.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.830" end="00:02:51.670">...sort of two-part because we have the desktop things that are going on and then we</p>
      <p begin="00:02:51.670" end="00:02:56.580">have additive manufacturing which is going on in the industry so desktop printers</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.580" end="00:03:00.510">as you see here this is...qthree by three-d systems.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.570" end="00:03:02.070">Hundred-thousand-dollars</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.510" end="00:03:08.150">the plastic is relatively inexpensive fifty bucks a kilogram.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:08.150" end="00:03:12.720">It really opens up this is a this is a little bit more advanced printers that you scene because it has</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:18.950">...bed leveling...so, it's opening up three-d printing to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:18.950" end="00:03:24.130">more people than just the people who do this for a hobby and they really they know</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.130" end="00:03:27.540">it inside and out and they want to learned its opening it up for</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.540" end="00:03:34.700">a much larger audience the education I was at high schools I'm working with kids doing</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.700" end="00:03:39.140">robots and suddenly you could see these kids visualize that they</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.140" end="00:03:43.070">can rapidly innovate their designed even though it's just a high school competition for</p>
      <p begin="00:03:43.070" end="00:03:46.860">...they can rapidly innovate on their designs and they can see the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.860" end="00:03:51.180">possibilities where they're going with this they can print the pieces that it</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.180" end="00:03:56.340">takes to build a robot and it's really interesting to see that there's a whole new generation of people coming up</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.340" end="00:04:04.080">that are going to think very differently about how you do product design.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:07.680">Three-d print bureaus...we...manufacturing facilities</p>
      <p begin="00:04:08.820" end="00:04:13.940">enables those that don't have printers.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.940" end="00:04:18.460">Those people who don't want to flats with the printers the ability to print</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.460" end="00:04:23.090">from their desktop and receive something much more complex so the print</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.090" end="00:04:27.780">...of the fabrication services they could do very high-quality parts they</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.780" end="00:04:32.700">can get down to fifty microns precision they can do things</p>
      <p begin="00:04:32.700" end="00:04:37.330">that have strength better than casting and you could do...many</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.330" end="00:04:42.240">materials which suddenly takes the this whole concept all great what am I going to do with this</p>
      <p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:47.710">plastic single color thing it really opens up a lot of possibilities</p>
      <p begin="00:04:47.710" end="00:04:51.910">specifically for developers who are developing apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.910" end="00:04:56.090">That might be that customize existing things.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.090" end="00:05:01.250">So, let's take a look at the opportunities for the developers so.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:01.250" end="00:05:05.870">There's lots and lots of things that I've seen out there everything from.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:05.870" end="00:05:10.290">I want to phone case and that phone case I want customize I want my logo</p>
      <p begin="00:05:10.290" end="00:05:14.290">...I want my name on it I want my sport on it my nickname.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.320" end="00:05:19.900">These things are very easy content to print and very easy to modify</p>
      <p begin="00:05:19.900" end="00:05:24.820">and customized for individuals so there's entire industry springing up around</p>
      <p begin="00:05:24.820" end="00:05:29.780">I'm going to print you are case that service specific material and that's customized in</p>
      <p begin="00:05:29.780" end="00:05:35.090">a specific way that you want to see it and you could do this very interactively over the internet</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.090" end="00:05:39.690">scented in haven't manufactured by some third-party and deliver it</p>
      <p begin="00:05:39.690" end="00:05:43.010">...opening up a lot of opportunities for developers to move into</p>
      <p begin="00:05:43.010" end="00:05:47.890">right now so the key is to find the content define</p>
      <p begin="00:05:47.890" end="00:05:49.540">...and maybe not try to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:49.540" end="00:05:53.440">boil the entire ocean around three-d printing but to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.440" end="00:05:58.430">incentivizing designers to leverage the content that's out there to create</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58.430" end="00:06:03.460">specialize things for your customers and individualized things.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:03.460" end="00:06:07.050">For your customers.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.050" end="00:06:10.040">So, let's be clear about three bring.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:10.040" end="00:06:13.350">Three printing is not always so easy.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.350" end="00:06:15.020">In the past.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.020" end="00:06:17.110">You had non-standard driver stacks you've had a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:17.110" end="00:06:21.830">different slices that you could choose from you had com ports you have to configure</p>
      <p begin="00:06:21.830" end="00:06:27.090">of open-source software that you have to put together and work through and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:27.090" end="00:06:30.570">that's not always so easy for my mother to do so.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:31.600" end="00:06:35.150">We need to really overcome some of these problems printers have a fairly</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.150" end="00:06:40.180">low success rate like if you can get fifty percent success really get what you're looking for</p>
      <p begin="00:06:40.180" end="00:06:44.910">...could do a pretty good and that's not really analogous to what you think of in</p>
      <p begin="00:06:44.910" end="00:06:47.010">the normal printing.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:47.010" end="00:06:48.680">It's a little bit lower success</p>
      <p begin="00:06:48.680" end="00:06:52.230">rate so we have a ways to go in order to get these desktop printers really,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:52.230" end="00:06:55.280">really working the other thing is.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:06:55.930">Nobody can tell</p>
      <p begin="00:06:55.930" end="00:07:00.700">what the printers do you can't get any information from your printer in terms of</p>
      <p begin="00:07:00.700" end="00:07:02.010">...the materials</p>
      <p begin="00:07:02.010" end="00:07:07.370">even on paper printers you could tell what kind of paper uses but in a three-d printer</p>
      <p begin="00:07:07.370" end="00:07:12.330">today you really have no information about what's coming back with the materials which the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:12.330" end="00:07:19.060">thin wall size what's the what's the bed size the volume of the bed</p>
      <p begin="00:07:19.060" end="00:07:22.380">so this is really been blockers to entry in the past.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:23.560" end="00:07:26.260">So, what I want to do is I want to talk about?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:26.260" end="00:07:29.710">What we've done in...ten?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:29.710" end="00:07:32.550">That would help solve some of these problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:32.550" end="00:07:34.790">...start out with this first bullet workflow.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:35.990" end="00:07:43.460">This is an interesting concept we call it workflow but I really need to clarify exactly</p>
      <p begin="00:07:43.460" end="00:07:48.550">...the process of actually getting your print prepared to go to the printer.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:48.550" end="00:07:53.530">So, if you keep this context throughout the rest of this presentation will be a little more clear what I'm talking</p>
      <p begin="00:07:53.530" end="00:07:58.260">about so repair capabilities and api is</p>
      <p begin="00:07:58.260" end="00:08:02.610">repair we call repair many other people call it healing or</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02.610" end="00:08:06.860">...fixing but what we call repair is fixing a</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.860" end="00:08:11.780">models so that it can be prepared to print a model could be filled with holes if you had</p>
      <p begin="00:08:11.780" end="00:08:15.800">a for instance and animation program and</p>
      <p begin="00:08:15.800" end="00:08:21.050">that animation program had a bunch of cartoon characters and it doesn't have to be</p>
      <p begin="00:08:21.050" end="00:08:25.850">a solid model it can be a facade they could be just a you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:25.850" end="00:08:29.580">texture on top of a shape and if you go to try to print something like that</p>
      <p begin="00:08:29.580" end="00:08:34.570">it just doesn't work when you print something has to be a solid object so this</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.570" end="00:08:40.400">is been a major blocker as the industry is developed is</p>
      <p begin="00:08:40.400" end="00:08:45.120">getting it printable so we're putting api is in the box that are going to do this for</p>
      <p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:49.060">you also another major driver is plug-and-play.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:50.410" end="00:08:54.800">If you don't have plug-and-play and you have to do a bunch of configuration especially around</p>
      <p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:59.370">com ports to get things lined up all of the proper things</p>
      <p begin="00:08:59.370" end="00:09:04.200">installed for your workflow to go through it really becomes problematic my</p>
      <p begin="00:09:04.200" end="00:09:09.980">mother is not going to do it...mom wants to do is plug-in and just have</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.980" end="00:09:14.560">at work I want to do file print so this whole abstraction that we have around</p>
      <p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:17.210">two-d printing we really need to extend that</p>
      <p begin="00:09:17.210" end="00:09:19.320">into three printing and then finally.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:20.570" end="00:09:24.830">...a lot of people just won't do won't have these printers but maybe they want play</p>
      <p begin="00:09:24.830" end="00:09:29.820">with it or experiment with it and try it so cloud printing we feel is very important printers</p>
      <p begin="00:09:29.820" end="00:09:35.410">are expensive still and the quality of the print the difficulty it is to</p>
      <p begin="00:09:35.410" end="00:09:39.220">manage the print really lends itself for people saying,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:39.220" end="00:09:41.890">yeah, I want to make this part I needed</p>
      <p begin="00:09:41.890" end="00:09:46.620">customize part but I really need in metal and I'm not going to go spin three hundred-thousand-dollars</p>
      <p begin="00:09:46.620" end="00:09:50.470">...a laser centered printer just so I can do this</p>
      <p begin="00:09:50.470" end="00:09:56.460">one print so cloud printing we think is very important part or strategy.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:56.460" end="00:10:00.590">Remember...printing about twenty years ago.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:00.590" end="00:10:04.140">...special driver for lotus one-two-three</p>
      <p begin="00:10:04.140" end="00:10:09.060">for a specific printer so you go to buy software...the first</p>
      <p begin="00:10:09.060" end="00:10:13.860">...do is check and see if you've got the right printer that they have a driver supported for</p>
      <p begin="00:10:13.860" end="00:10:19.620">it was ridiculous microsoft solve that problem this is where we are right</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.620" end="00:10:25.010">now with three-d printing is we need to understand</p>
      <p begin="00:10:25.010" end="00:10:29.310">what materials how it's, you know, and, each just work everything needs to be</p>
      <p begin="00:10:29.310" end="00:10:33.890">...from the repair tools to the slice or everything needs to work in a</p>
      <p begin="00:10:33.890" end="00:10:41.580">role when you plug it in so that it's a file print experience.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:41.580" end="00:10:45.750">So, we're going to talk about three workflow once again let me go back to remind you that the workflows the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:45.750" end="00:10:49.240">process from file print to actually the printing starting.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:50.420" end="00:10:55.190">Okay, so, the file print experience is very familiar dialogue everybody uses it in</p>
      <p begin="00:10:56.330" end="00:10:58.790">tutti printing and it's a very good</p>
      <p begin="00:11:00.020" end="00:11:07.680">analogue applying here you can select...three printer or you can...cloud printer.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:07.680" end="00:11:10.840">Unfortunately with three-d print.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:10.840" end="00:11:15.020">It's a much more complex process to get through that</p>
      <p begin="00:11:15.020" end="00:11:17.050">it is with tutti print.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:17.050" end="00:11:20.270">So, there's options for the prayer which is the same</p>
      <p begin="00:11:20.270" end="00:11:24.160">as a tutti there's material assignment which is kind of analogous to</p>
      <p begin="00:11:24.160" end="00:11:27.230">selecting right paper to print on but you also have to be</p>
      <p begin="00:11:27.230" end="00:11:32.630">able to look at your objects and did put them on the plate so that they print</p>
      <p begin="00:11:32.630" end="00:11:37.990">...the right place there's a lot of different things to do so?</p>
      <p begin="00:11:37.990" end="00:11:41.020">I'd like to do a demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:41.020" end="00:11:45.280">Of windows ten three-d workflow.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:45.280" end="00:11:51.590">Start by hitting the right button...I hope.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:51.590" end="00:11:54.530">Tyra okay this is any app I</p>
      <p begin="00:11:54.530" end="00:11:58.800">...three-d builders our app but you could think of this is being in the app</p>
      <p begin="00:11:58.800" end="00:12:03.470">at all so I'm going to start this is a touch app or a mouse app either</p>
      <p begin="00:12:03.470" end="00:12:05.620">one you wish so I'm going to start by just</p>
      <p begin="00:12:05.620" end="00:12:12.860">saying print because the app really isn't so important as the print workflow.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:12.860" end="00:12:19.440">here's the workflow notice my train my...multiple objects on the bed.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:24.410">There's a few key things you get an error right in the top that saying you're not on the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:24.410" end="00:12:27.430">bed this print is not going to succeed because you're not on the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:27.430" end="00:12:32.010">bed an easy way to do is just a click it and it goes on the bed</p>
      <p begin="00:12:32.010" end="00:12:36.400">okay I have another error up...I'm going to talk about that later.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:36.400" end="00:12:41.850">So, I would like to look at this object first so I'd like to spin it around like this and take a</p>
      <p begin="00:12:41.850" end="00:12:45.850">look at it and, yeah, it looks pretty good that's what I want to see upside down</p>
      <p begin="00:12:45.850" end="00:12:49.470">right side up one of the key things is there's a true</p>
      <p begin="00:12:49.470" end="00:12:53.320">experience with the volume of the print and so.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:53.320" end="00:12:55.470">Perhaps I would like to</p>
      <p begin="00:12:55.470" end="00:12:59.730">...model and make it bigger...therefore more expensive</p>
      <p begin="00:12:59.730" end="00:13:04.240">or smaller and I can do that I could do it to the point where it no longer fits</p>
      <p begin="00:13:04.240" end="00:13:10.700">of my print bed so I can scale it back down again.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:10.700" end="00:13:12.490">So, that's important it's important</p>
      <p begin="00:13:12.490" end="00:13:16.860">because of cost if you're going to send this out to a print bureau the bulk of the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:16.860" end="00:13:21.280">price's based upon the volume so if you print if you go</p>
      <p begin="00:13:21.280" end="00:13:23.970">...scandals and you get scanned and</p>
      <p begin="00:13:23.970" end="00:13:28.580">zoom yourself up really big you probably going to pay a thousand-dollars to get your little scan</p>
      <p begin="00:13:28.580" end="00:13:34.450">printed at the print bureau so you might want to scale it down a little bit to be a little more affordable you can...down to the twenty</p>
      <p begin="00:13:34.450" end="00:13:39.260">five-dollar range but since it's volume goes up as a...of the size.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:39.260" end="00:13:39.760">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:40.770" end="00:13:45.070">Other thing is if I happen to I can move things around on the print bit to make</p>
      <p begin="00:13:45.070" end="00:13:48.840">of fit if I happen to have them up off the printed when they,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:48.840" end="00:13:52.410">come on,...that's unfortunate I would really like to lay it down on</p>
      <p begin="00:13:52.410" end="00:13:56.510">different bid so you could just pop it right down to the print bed so that you're</p>
      <p begin="00:13:56.510" end="00:14:05.140">not printing supports up to your object which is floating mid-air so other things.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:05.140" end="00:14:08.060">There are some editing tools that we've left in here.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:09.790" end="00:14:14.180">The next thing that you need to do is you really need to...what material is an since we have the api</p>
      <p begin="00:14:14.180" end="00:14:19.180">is in the operating system that the workflow has the ability to understand the printer bed size</p>
      <p begin="00:14:19.180" end="00:14:24.240">...the materials I can select this guy and I can say I really want to have a</p>
      <p begin="00:14:24.240" end="00:14:25.850">blue train.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:25.850" end="00:14:28.990">And, then I can go to the selection tool and select all</p>
      <p begin="00:14:28.990" end="00:14:33.230">...select the train and say I want my wheels green.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:33.230" end="00:14:38.150">Okay,...we think of color as a material is a property</p>
      <p begin="00:14:38.150" end="00:14:42.480">of a material but you could just as well be saying I want this</p>
      <p begin="00:14:42.480" end="00:14:47.340">golda aluminum or whatever and then when you send it out to print it</p>
      <p begin="00:14:47.340" end="00:14:52.640">prints and then finally over here on the left-hand side you can see you could selected density...this</p>
      <p begin="00:14:52.640" end="00:14:57.500">information is coming back from the printer is what is the density that should be printed in the density of the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:57.500" end="00:15:02.320">end fill the quality whether be draft quality or high-quality</p>
      <p begin="00:15:02.320" end="00:15:06.190">and whether you want rafts or supports on if the printer had more capabilities you</p>
      <p begin="00:15:06.190" end="00:15:10.540">would have more capabilities listed there and then finally when everything's done</p>
      <p begin="00:15:10.540" end="00:15:17.200">...are gone you just hit print and off you go and you...</p>
      <p begin="00:15:17.200" end="00:15:19.010">...you go and print.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:19.010" end="00:15:26.580">Ok, so, that's a little demo of the direction we're heading.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:26.580" end="00:15:30.920">Windows ten in windows eight we barely tolerated the printing and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:30.920" end="00:15:34.860">...windows ten we've really fleshed it out to give people control so that's</p>
      <p begin="00:15:34.860" end="00:15:37.720">are really cool but what does that mean to you as a</p>
      <p begin="00:15:37.720" end="00:15:41.670">developer what that means is we've done</p>
      <p begin="00:15:41.670" end="00:15:47.240">the heavy lifting you don't have to do a three-d viewing tool.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:47.240" end="00:15:51.580">You don't have to create the user interaction in order to view things and spend things around and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:51.580" end="00:15:56.270">look at it if you're very simple...and you really just want to.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:56.270" end="00:16:01.470">Print something like I have a cartoon here I like to print you know, joe the guns</p>
      <p begin="00:16:01.470" end="00:16:05.890">...you really just need to throw that model over the wall</p>
      <p begin="00:16:05.890" end="00:16:10.620">to us through the file print capability and then let us take</p>
      <p begin="00:16:10.620" end="00:16:15.340">care of the rest of it we can repair it we can scale it for printing and we can</p>
      <p begin="00:16:15.340" end="00:16:21.100">...materials to be printed or the colors to be printed and then you can move on to either printed</p>
      <p begin="00:16:21.100" end="00:16:24.520">a print bureau or printed locally so the three-d content is all you</p>
      <p begin="00:16:24.520" end="00:16:27.500">have to do simplifies ux you get</p>
      <p begin="00:16:27.500" end="00:16:33.460">...focus on your core features will take care the heavy lifting around the print pipelined.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:33.460" end="00:16:38.590">But, what if you want to do something a little more complex than that?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:39.620" end="00:16:44.510">For instance if you might be aac had application that you really want to have a great deal of</p>
      <p begin="00:16:44.510" end="00:16:49.420">control over what you're doing maybe you don't want to just throw it over to our repair tool because</p>
      <p begin="00:16:49.420" end="00:16:54.290">repair does change the model and if your...you're probably very concerned about tolerances...the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:54.290" end="00:17:00.390">model being which uone we're actually giving a set of api...talked in the workflow.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:00.390" end="00:17:01.280">About the api</p>
      <p begin="00:17:01.280" end="00:17:05.960">is the api to get information about the printer what kind of material can handle</p>
      <p begin="00:17:05.960" end="00:17:10.130">...capability we don't have all of the printer capabilities put into windows ten</p>
      <p begin="00:17:10.130" end="00:17:15.210">yet but we certainly know the volume and we know the materials loaded in the printer so you can go through</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.210" end="00:17:20.030">do that selection but if you're more like a cat application and you really want to do the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:20.030" end="00:17:24.030">...the selection of the materials as a designer and then</p>
      <p begin="00:17:24.030" end="00:17:28.080">send those materials down we give you the api to do that understand you</p>
      <p begin="00:17:28.080" end="00:17:34.410">can install your printer or you can stop printer meta data and you could actually do that</p>
      <p begin="00:17:34.410" end="00:17:35.400">Selection from your</p>
      <p begin="00:17:35.400" end="00:17:39.850">cat application when it gets to the print workflow will get out of the way...see</p>
      <p begin="00:17:39.850" end="00:17:45.560">others already printers there's already material selected will back off if you if</p>
      <p begin="00:17:45.560" end="00:17:49.080">you're designer selects something less complex...that's not a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:49.080" end="00:17:53.270">printer material you can edit by making selections in the print workflow.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:54.550" end="00:18:01.460">We also are putting in the box validate...tools because.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:01.460" end="00:18:04.560">One of the big problems is the models aren't</p>
      <p begin="00:18:04.560" end="00:18:09.660">printable so it really is best for an advanced</p>
      <p begin="00:18:09.660" end="00:18:14.630">application something that's not printing toys or something that you don't care so much</p>
      <p begin="00:18:14.630" end="00:18:19.170">about your shapes being modified sometimes these are just tenths of a</p>
      <p begin="00:18:19.170" end="00:18:23.920">millimeter to close holes and sometimes they're bigger like if you did a plane cut</p>
      <p begin="00:18:23.920" end="00:18:31.140">...you left the bottom of...model from a scanned completely open we would have to close that.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:31.140" end="00:18:34.300">Look, we're going to put the api is in-box to do that automatically so that</p>
      <p begin="00:18:34.300" end="00:18:39.160">you could access those api or you could access other api is right there to get it fixed and will</p>
      <p begin="00:18:39.160" end="00:18:42.480">automatically fix it and will also send you back information about</p>
      <p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:47.150">what we've changed this is a single highest barrier?</p>
      <p begin="00:18:47.150" end="00:18:52.860">Removed.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:52.860" end="00:18:56.910">Cloud printing services you can really make some fantastic things with the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:56.910" end="00:19:00.210">...printing services so there's</p>
      <p begin="00:19:00.210" end="00:19:04.630">a large companies who are actually putting desktop printers on the deaths of their</p>
      <p begin="00:19:04.630" end="00:19:09.200">designers and engineers and those large companies will.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:09.200" end="00:19:10.830">Print something in plastic.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:11.980" end="00:19:14.310">And, they'll see that they fit and all,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:14.310" end="00:19:20.140">you know, drive fitted in the assembly and make sure that's right but ultimately they want something better cloud</p>
      <p begin="00:19:20.140" end="00:19:24.950">printing services enables so we partner with cuba phi.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:24.950" end="00:19:29.830">which is three-d systems and these are some of the things that they have available</p>
      <p begin="00:19:29.830" end="00:19:33.320">straighter file print you can get professional materials</p>
      <p begin="00:19:33.320" end="00:19:37.700">professionally done and if you look at some of these things these things are not</p>
      <p begin="00:19:37.700" end="00:19:48.380">easy to do using traditional manufacturing that can methods?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:48.380" end="00:19:51.180">Driver development.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:51.180" end="00:19:52.800">We have.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:52.800" end="00:19:55.350">To driver models.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:55.350" end="00:19:58.600">...very briefly because probably not so many of you guys are</p>
      <p begin="00:19:58.600" end="00:20:04.250">doing driver development we have a standard inbox driver it works with a</p>
      <p begin="00:20:04.250" end="00:20:08.160">...marlon based printer that except g code.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:08.160" end="00:20:11.760">With this standard model you don't have to</p>
      <p begin="00:20:11.760" end="00:20:17.310">...the box and it comes for windows update and all you need to do is</p>
      <p begin="00:20:17.310" end="00:20:22.240">set the usb descriptors there's two things you set the first one is the microsoft so</p>
      <p begin="00:20:22.240" end="00:20:26.330">the tell it it's a three-d printer and the second one is you pick a matching</p>
      <p begin="00:20:26.330" end="00:20:30.370">...best matches your printer like if it's a delta you might pretty delta if it's a</p>
      <p begin="00:20:30.370" end="00:20:34.190">cartesian you could pick that so we have a number of standard models that you</p>
      <p begin="00:20:34.190" end="00:20:38.180">...you say I'm like that but my bed sizes different</p>
      <p begin="00:20:38.180" end="00:20:42.420">and here's my bed size so no driver development necessary you want to build</p>
      <p begin="00:20:42.420" end="00:20:45.400">a represent or you can have a driver the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:45.400" end="00:20:49.520">just works with windows automatically.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:53.030">The other one is a virtual software...so what we've done</p>
      <p begin="00:20:53.030" end="00:20:56.280">is in order to make the driver developments simpler.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:57.560" end="00:20:59.460">We've made a driver</p>
      <p begin="00:20:59.460" end="00:21:05.130">...software driver and we put a little layer of a deal on the bottom</p>
      <p begin="00:21:05.130" end="00:21:10.900">dls something that you would do and what it does is it takes information from the</p>
      <p begin="00:21:10.900" end="00:21:15.750">software driver allows you to decide what topology want to use how to</p>
      <p begin="00:21:15.750" end="00:21:20.640">communicate with your printer and if you need to make any transforms like perhaps</p>
      <p begin="00:21:20.640" end="00:21:24.900">you have something unique about your printer where you need something that you have to transform like you're</p>
      <p begin="00:21:24.900" end="00:21:29.050">sending blocks of decode instead of individual...something like that so there's,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:29.050" end="00:21:34.990">there's three parts of it you can add a custom slice or through a capability we</p>
      <p begin="00:21:34.990" end="00:21:36.100">color render filter?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:37.480" end="00:21:39.470">You can...a custom interface to the dl.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:40.520" end="00:21:45.380">You can also replace the workflow another workflow I showed you in windows is</p>
      <p begin="00:21:45.380" end="00:21:49.750">completely replaceable you could make but, windows device application</p>
      <p begin="00:21:50.870" end="00:21:55.530">that does anything specific to your printer and as soon as</p>
      <p begin="00:21:55.530" end="00:21:59.720">you're printer drivers installed to back off completely and we'll</p>
      <p begin="00:21:59.720" end="00:22:04.630">...is you drop down the printer selection the workflow will disappear</p>
      <p begin="00:22:04.630" end="00:22:09.270">and your workflow will appear there so all three of those pieces make it very</p>
      <p begin="00:22:09.270" end="00:22:14.850">customizable for your printer you don't have to be decode you can have your own slice or if you think that's</p>
      <p begin="00:22:14.850" end="00:22:17.910">part of your ip...works.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:17.910" end="00:22:22.310">Because of these two driver models you can go out there and you</p>
      <p begin="00:22:22.310" end="00:22:23.670">can see on the table today.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:24.710" end="00:22:27.790">Are seven printers out there those are just the ones we have out there but</p>
      <p begin="00:22:27.790" end="00:22:32.170">and these are a number of...printers...and all of them we</p>
      <p begin="00:22:32.170" end="00:22:37.300">...very recently...be creative so we have a number of printers</p>
      <p begin="00:22:37.300" end="00:22:45.550">the just work windows plug-and-play and everything's included?</p>
      <p begin="00:22:45.550" end="00:22:47.130">So, working with three-d data.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:49.990" end="00:22:53.970">This is sort of the end of my part of the presentation but what you see here</p>
      <p begin="00:22:53.970" end="00:22:56.590">in this chair is a very complex.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:57.740" end="00:22:59.080">Print.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:59.080" end="00:23:02.600">So,...is here to talk about three mf format</p>
      <p begin="00:23:02.600" end="00:23:06.360">in the future design of where we're headed</p>
      <p begin="00:23:06.360" end="00:23:14.600">with three printing in the future so here's an?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:14.600" end="00:23:20.760">Thank you so first off who am I well I haven't actually</p>
      <p begin="00:23:20.760" end="00:23:24.440">...microsoft for that long I originally got...three-d printing as a hobby</p>
      <p begin="00:23:24.440" end="00:23:30.260">is I've got in by making open-source designs if you</p>
      <p begin="00:23:30.260" end="00:23:36.060">wandered around in the three-d printing world you might have run across a few the things I've made you can find my things</p>
      <p begin="00:23:36.060" end="00:23:41.150">on thing averse but in the process of doing design for three-d objects I</p>
      <p begin="00:23:41.150" end="00:23:45.660">realized just how limited we were in the software just how many problems</p>
      <p begin="00:23:45.660" end="00:23:51.100">they were actually making things work making things get printed properly and,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:51.100" end="00:23:54.820">just in creating the things that you can imagine and,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:54.820" end="00:23:57.790">I was kind of excited to come to microsoft because there was</p>
      <p begin="00:23:57.790" end="00:24:02.690">an opportunity to actually fix a lot of these problems that I saw in</p>
      <p begin="00:24:02.690" end="00:24:07.470">the world we role dealing with one of the big ones, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:07.470" end="00:24:09.200">there's a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:14.830">complaints out there about the file formats that we currently use and,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:14.830" end="00:24:20.140">we're trying to address that by actually making a new format now you've got to have</p>
      <p begin="00:24:20.140" end="00:24:24.610">a good reason to make a new format right I mean nobody wants extra format</p>
      <p begin="00:24:24.610" end="00:24:28.980">...for the fun of it but at the end of the day there is a good reason here and the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:28.980" end="00:24:33.850">reason is that the really hasn't been something truly for three-d printing</p>
      <p begin="00:24:33.850" end="00:24:38.390">before the closest thing we had were a couple of formats a</p>
      <p begin="00:24:38.390" end="00:24:43.930">enough and...a...I'm sure well-known...most view and,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:43.930" end="00:24:48.650">it's deficiencies are well-known as well it's lacking all kinds of features it's</p>
      <p begin="00:24:48.650" end="00:24:54.310">close to thirty-years-old now it simply doesn't have the kind of data that we need.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:54.310" end="00:24:58.890">...math has also tried to kind of address this but they've...a different approach and,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:58.890" end="00:25:01.960">you know, basically what happened was we were approached by a</p>
      <p begin="00:25:01.960" end="00:25:06.530">...various partners from the three-d printer companies and cad companies and they told</p>
      <p begin="00:25:06.530" end="00:25:10.050">us look neither of these formats is solving our problem we</p>
      <p begin="00:25:10.050" end="00:25:14.300">can't adoptees we need something better and here are requirements</p>
      <p begin="00:25:14.300" end="00:25:19.660">he said all right we're in a good position we're in a place where we can talk to everybody in the industry</p>
      <p begin="00:25:19.660" end="00:25:24.660">...a place where we can help to define good agreement and find some is actually going to</p>
      <p begin="00:25:24.660" end="00:25:29.550">work actually going to solve the problems and the feasible so,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:29.550" end="00:25:33.190">you know, there are lots of other formats...at as well obviously.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:34.230" end="00:25:39.220">Manufacturing is not limited to three-d printing and the rest of the manufacturing world mostly uses</p>
      <p begin="00:25:39.220" end="00:25:44.390">...they've got file formats...stepper very common but,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:44.390" end="00:25:49.230">these are nerves formats and let me tell you non-uniform rational</p>
      <p begin="00:25:49.230" end="00:25:55.460">busy spines are not for everyone they're very powerful but they're also very complicated</p>
      <p begin="00:25:55.460" end="00:25:57.740">...beard entry and there's a reason</p>
      <p begin="00:25:57.740" end="00:26:02.180">is only a few giant cad companies that really push this kind of stuff because they have the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:02.180" end="00:26:07.910">enormous investment and expertise to do that but, we're looking at is trying to broaden this out</p>
      <p begin="00:26:07.910" end="00:26:12.450">to wider set of developers and that means using something simpler and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:12.450" end="00:26:17.760">more easily implement...now a lot of what's been using the three-d printing industry</p>
      <p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:22.720">is actually sort of re purpose rendering formats things like lbj</p>
      <p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:28.560">vr eml there's many more the problem with these format is they're really not targeted</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.560" end="00:26:33.040">at three printing so they've got all kinds of great information about moonlighting and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:33.040" end="00:26:37.880">fog in whatever you might need for rendering but that doesn't matter to us we care</p>
      <p begin="00:26:37.880" end="00:26:43.800">about is material and materials a lot more than color we're talking about metals</p>
      <p begin="00:26:43.800" end="00:26:47.960">we're talking about strength we're talking about conductivity all sorts of things that</p>
      <p begin="00:26:47.960" end="00:26:51.860">just have no meaning in a rendering world and in addition a lot of rendered</p>
      <p begin="00:26:51.860" end="00:26:54.640">objects simply aren't real.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:59.290">They're meant to look all right but fundamentally...smoke and mirrors they're not solid and they're</p>
      <p begin="00:26:59.290" end="00:27:04.290">not something that any printer can create something out of that's something that we really need to look at</p>
      <p begin="00:27:04.290" end="00:27:10.010">when we're doing our format that's truly for three-d printing.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:10.010" end="00:27:13.530">So, what we've done is we've assembled a consortium</p>
      <p begin="00:27:13.530" end="00:27:18.460">because at the end of the day nobody cares reduce alone we need to work with</p>
      <p begin="00:27:18.460" end="00:27:22.160">partners the whole point of this is to get broad adoption that's the only way that</p>
      <p begin="00:27:22.160" end="00:27:25.330">a format is useful to the world so we've partnered</p>
      <p begin="00:27:25.330" end="00:27:31.030">up we've got leading partners in the cad space for talking to, you know, does and auto</p>
      <p begin="00:27:31.030" end="00:27:37.210">desk net fab does cad work as well or talking to middleware companies</p>
      <p begin="00:27:37.210" end="00:27:42.930">that deal with reading models for print and for ...putting together</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42.930" end="00:27:47.530">for instance the workflows to make manufacturing possible as places like shape</p>
      <p begin="00:27:47.530" end="00:27:51.730">ways and net fab and we're also...partners in manufacturing so as I</p>
      <p begin="00:27:51.730" end="00:27:55.720">am solutions makes metal printers hp is getting into the printing industry now</p>
      <p begin="00:27:55.720" end="00:28:00.810">audio desk makes their own and, the important thing of having all these people involved</p>
      <p begin="00:28:00.810" end="00:28:03.760">as we make sure that we can actually have something</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.760" end="00:28:08.150">that addresses everybody's needs and works for the whole pipeline all the way from</p>
      <p begin="00:28:08.150" end="00:28:11.920">cad to manufacturing without needing any sort of?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:11.920" end="00:28:17.240">Re translation or disruption of the data.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:17.240" end="00:28:20.650">Of course was really important that this been open format</p>
      <p begin="00:28:20.650" end="00:28:24.850">I mean realistically the format is only worth something to all</p>
      <p begin="00:28:24.850" end="00:28:29.370">of these partners if it's broadly adopted has absolutely no reason for</p>
      <p begin="00:28:29.370" end="00:28:33.690">to be proprietary so you can go out online right now to our website</p>
      <p begin="00:28:33.690" end="00:28:37.680">...dot io and you can find...specks.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:37.680" end="00:28:42.620">we are working to make sure that this is available to everyone and to help adoption</p>
      <p begin="00:28:42.620" end="00:28:47.490">...actually opening up some open-source code so you will I don't know if</p>
      <p begin="00:28:47.490" end="00:28:52.190">...actually live just yet but there will be links to get have repositories that have</p>
      <p begin="00:28:52.190" end="00:28:57.690">code under open-source...licenses and this is to help with file parsing</p>
      <p begin="00:28:57.690" end="00:29:02.660">with read and write at the end of the day there's no reason to ask everyone of you developers to go read</p>
      <p begin="00:29:02.660" end="00:29:06.770">our spec and go independently write a parser that's a waste of time so</p>
      <p begin="00:29:06.770" end="00:29:08.730">we'll dual once will do it...</p>
      <p begin="00:29:08.730" end="00:29:13.620">we'll make it available and this is a good way to make sure that we have a format that's consistent</p>
      <p begin="00:29:13.620" end="00:29:17.560">that actually gets the data read properly and every place and we</p>
      <p begin="00:29:17.560" end="00:29:23.430">understand that this is how we can make something that's actually useful for the industry.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:23.430" end="00:29:28.410">Now when we go through creating...of course we're looking at the other formats</p>
      <p begin="00:29:28.410" end="00:29:33.280">are saying well I've talked about the deficiencies so how are we going to fix that why is</p>
      <p begin="00:29:33.280" end="00:29:38.100">three-month going to be different well we basically have to take all the good</p>
      <p begin="00:29:38.100" end="00:29:42.630">parts of the other formats remove all the bad parts and our own things we think</p>
      <p begin="00:29:42.630" end="00:29:47.580">are truly unique and really important for three-d printing so first and foremost needs</p>
      <p begin="00:29:47.580" end="00:29:51.750">to be complete you can't have external references floating around</p>
      <p begin="00:29:51.750" end="00:29:56.660">that get broken every time you move a file this is something that I've dealt with too many times to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:56.660" end="00:30:02.010">count we use a common method open packaging conventions that basically</p>
      <p begin="00:30:02.010" end="00:30:07.730">allow us to have a package that contains any number of files we need has clear</p>
      <p begin="00:30:07.730" end="00:30:14.380">relationships...ways to basically keep all of the data organized and, finally,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:14.380" end="00:30:19.380">you know, we also need to be contact so this is a zip package that helps to make sure that the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:19.380" end="00:30:21.210">transfer is fast</p>
      <p begin="00:30:21.210" end="00:30:26.130">efficient but internally we also have to avoid duplications we use we make</p>
      <p begin="00:30:26.130" end="00:30:31.030">a strong use of references make sure that are vertices are not repeated we reference them</p>
      <p begin="00:30:31.030" end="00:30:35.180">are objects are not repeated we can make multiple copies and reference these</p>
      <p begin="00:30:35.180" end="00:30:40.780">things are really important for keeping the file size reasonable keeping the parsing speed up?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:40.780" end="00:30:45.770">then we also decided it was important at the end of the day this be human readable format looking</p>
      <p begin="00:30:45.770" end="00:30:50.290">...what formats of really been adopted well this turns out to be important I mean,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:50.290" end="00:30:54.810">you know, is developers that you need the ability to actually go through and</p>
      <p begin="00:30:54.810" end="00:30:59.200">error check and debug and dealing with a giant binary blob is</p>
      <p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:04.110">a huge problem by using xml internally we make this format</p>
      <p begin="00:31:04.110" end="00:31:09.410">largely self documenting you can read through it you can see what somebody meant and,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:09.410" end="00:31:13.460">we have lots of tools available to deal with this kind of thing it's a very</p>
      <p begin="00:31:13.460" end="00:31:18.930">well-understood standard we will make use of binary formats when that makes sense but we'll</p>
      <p begin="00:31:18.930" end="00:31:22.580">use well-known ones things like p energies and jpeg that store data</p>
      <p begin="00:31:22.580" end="00:31:26.830">and very well-known ways because certainly there are times</p>
      <p begin="00:31:26.830" end="00:31:32.770">...ridge data where you don't want to just write everything out in english?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:32.770" end="00:31:36.560">But, there are some other important x...considerations here as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:36.560" end="00:31:40.040">The extensibility this format is really key.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:40.040" end="00:31:44.470">We made the core specification as minimal as we could.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:44.470" end="00:31:50.440">So, basically this is sort of as...they can do all of the most</p>
      <p begin="00:31:50.440" end="00:31:55.300">basic things that basic printers need and basic...apps use and you don't have to think</p>
      <p begin="00:31:55.300" end="00:31:59.210">about any of the more complex stuff you have a very narrow set of things that you</p>
      <p begin="00:31:59.210" end="00:32:03.530">need to implement and it's a short spec it's an easy read</p>
      <p begin="00:32:03.530" end="00:32:08.720">...promise helped write it and, then we need to make</p>
      <p begin="00:32:08.720" end="00:32:12.950">extensible because even though we know a lot of the features we need now</p>
      <p begin="00:32:12.950" end="00:32:17.860">we can't possibly know all the future features will need in the future so we actually make use</p>
      <p begin="00:32:17.860" end="00:32:22.850">of xml namespaces to have a really clear extension model so you can have a new names</p>
      <p begin="00:32:22.850" end="00:32:27.050">...for your extensions and you can make it clear the beginning of file hey I've got</p>
      <p begin="00:32:27.050" end="00:32:31.590">this extra information and you can as an app make it clear whether you</p>
      <p begin="00:32:31.590" end="00:32:34.900">understand better not and if you don't understand those if you have</p>
      <p begin="00:32:34.900" end="00:32:39.220">an implemented those kinds of extensions you can just wipe them out ignore them you have to</p>
      <p begin="00:32:39.220" end="00:32:43.120">do any extra processing you can just drop down to the minimal core...or</p>
      <p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:47.780">whichever said of extensions you do understand without actually losing the ability to process the</p>
      <p begin="00:32:47.780" end="00:32:54.970">file we already have created one extension we called the materials and properties extension you can</p>
      <p begin="00:32:54.970" end="00:33:00.950">...our website and that's to handle all these things like color when you're looking at things</p>
      <p begin="00:33:00.950" end="00:33:05.560">you'd expect from a rendell format especially when you're talking about sending things to a print bureau</p>
      <p begin="00:33:05.560" end="00:33:08.750">they can do full color this allows us to have things like vertex</p>
      <p begin="00:33:08.750" end="00:33:13.010">...texture maps material definitions</p>
      <p begin="00:33:13.010" end="00:33:17.130">even composite materials all the things that you would expect and need and</p>
      <p begin="00:33:17.130" end="00:33:21.550">they're in clear ways that we can easily transfer from existing</p>
      <p begin="00:33:21.550" end="00:33:27.040">file formats into this one without losing information maybe the most</p>
      <p begin="00:33:27.040" end="00:33:31.860">important thing that separates this file format from others is that it is</p>
      <p begin="00:33:31.860" end="00:33:32.740">...ambiguous?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:33.910" end="00:33:37.150">And, this is really the key that separates us from the file</p>
      <p begin="00:33:37.150" end="00:33:41.250">formats of come before specially these rendering formats.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:41.250" end="00:33:43.850">To be a true three-d printable file you</p>
      <p begin="00:33:43.850" end="00:33:45.030">half to be solid.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:46.300" end="00:33:48.790">You have to actually represent a volume and this is</p>
      <p begin="00:33:48.790" end="00:33:53.080">a mathematical concept and it is not a simple one and it's been</p>
      <p begin="00:33:53.080" end="00:33:58.080">a big difficulty because the words like manifold...oriented and</p>
      <p begin="00:33:58.080" end="00:34:02.200">water tighter thrown around all the time but they're actually rather poorly defined if you put</p>
      <p begin="00:34:02.200" end="00:34:07.170">poke into them you'll notice that in different places they use different definitions depending on what</p>
      <p begin="00:34:07.170" end="00:34:12.210">their actual application is we've gone through and looked at the three-d printing application</p>
      <p begin="00:34:12.210" end="00:34:16.820">and found very specific definitions that we know will work for this</p>
      <p begin="00:34:16.820" end="00:34:21.000">swedes clearly defined in the spec it's clear how to verify it</p>
      <p begin="00:34:21.000" end="00:34:24.010">this is again part of our will be in, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:24.010" end="00:34:26.900">open-source code to make sure that anyone can verify</p>
      <p begin="00:34:26.900" end="00:34:31.840">...method verify consistently and then of course knowing using</p>
      <p begin="00:34:31.840" end="00:34:36.360">that connecting back to for instance the windows api or we can now repair of file and</p>
      <p begin="00:34:36.360" end="00:34:40.175">...that if you had a problem coming in maybe it was from, you</p>
      <p begin="00:34:40.175" end="00:34:43.800">know, of rendered objects that was not in fact closed we</p>
      <p begin="00:34:43.800" end="00:34:48.800">can guarantee you a manifold output will really print solid.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:53.740">So, you know, the other part of this is what about self intersections</p>
      <p begin="00:34:53.740" end="00:34:57.980">this is fundamentally ambiguous you can have an object that</p>
      <p begin="00:34:57.980" end="00:35:01.700">intersect itself and there's not really a good way to</p>
      <p begin="00:35:01.700" end="00:35:06.290">...a lot of times is actually very common coming out of design apps and the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:06.290" end="00:35:11.060">question is well ok so now what's the inside and what's the outside when we actually again have</p>
      <p begin="00:35:11.060" end="00:35:15.950">a very specific rule that's easy to handle in processing that</p>
      <p begin="00:35:15.950" end="00:35:20.770">allows you to remove all ambiguity from that so even if you have a self intersected file, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:20.770" end="00:35:24.770">that any printer will choose the same way to represent that</p>
      <p begin="00:35:24.770" end="00:35:31.480">as a solid object.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:31.480" end="00:35:36.210">That's all well and good but most of that is things that...have existed,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:36.210" end="00:35:40.100">you know, I mean fundamentally this is a triangle mesh format we've seen</p>
      <p begin="00:35:40.100" end="00:35:44.940">this before it's nothing crazy it's nothing out-of-the-ordinary we're just</p>
      <p begin="00:35:44.940" end="00:35:48.080">...nailing down those specific things that</p>
      <p begin="00:35:48.080" end="00:35:53.500">help to make sure that it's really going to work reliably for three printing.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:53.500" end="00:35:54.950">But, what's really interesting to me</p>
      <p begin="00:35:54.950" end="00:36:00.710">at least is that we can do something much more exciting in the future.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:00.710" end="00:36:05.540">What's amazing about three-d printing is you can now fabricate things that simply were not fabricate</p>
      <p begin="00:36:05.540" end="00:36:06.190">...before.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:07.280" end="00:36:12.150">You can look at pictures like this we can build the micro structures we can build,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:12.150" end="00:36:16.920">you know, these tiny little detailed pieces halloween out</p>
      <p begin="00:36:16.920" end="00:36:21.040">objects making more efficient structures there's printers</p>
      <p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:24.740">they can do material gradients you can actually continuously</p>
      <p begin="00:36:24.740" end="00:36:29.360">changing material like the mixture of alloy or the mixture of a composite across</p>
      <p begin="00:36:29.360" end="00:36:33.870">apart so suddenly you don't have these sudden juncture is where you go from</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.870" end="00:36:38.550">stiffed...flexible and, have your part tend to break there no now you can you</p>
      <p begin="00:36:38.550" end="00:36:43.460">can smoothly transition that across well we've never been able to do that before</p>
      <p begin="00:36:43.460" end="00:36:48.040">and what this means is that we've also never been able to design is before</p>
      <p begin="00:36:48.040" end="00:36:52.450">because what's the point of designing a part that's not possible to make?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:52.450" end="00:36:57.170">We have all kinds of amazing casual that exist but they're actually not made for this</p>
      <p begin="00:36:57.170" end="00:37:01.440">kind of thing so we now have this huge opportunity</p>
      <p begin="00:37:01.440" end="00:37:07.010">for the developers to think about what can we do to enable designers to take</p>
      <p begin="00:37:07.010" end="00:37:11.090">advantage of what three-d printers can now do we need tools that simplify</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.090" end="00:37:15.980">this immense complexity we need ways to actually take,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:15.980" end="00:37:19.690">you know, inspirations from nature for instance where.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:19.690" end="00:37:20.240">You have these</p>
      <p begin="00:37:20.240" end="00:37:25.880">incredibly complicated designs things that are fractal in nature but</p>
      <p begin="00:37:25.880" end="00:37:30.860">...that way because they are optimized they are the best shape for the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:30.860" end="00:37:35.980">problem there solving we can take advantage of that in our engineering designs as well and</p>
      <p begin="00:37:35.980" end="00:37:40.440">...product design is to make things were beautiful you can look at generate of</p>
      <p begin="00:37:40.440" end="00:37:45.390">design where this whole new paradigms possible where instead of saying I'm going to design this by</p>
      <p begin="00:37:45.390" end="00:37:50.340">...michael uppers and measuring and making it just this shape you can step back and say</p>
      <p begin="00:37:50.340" end="00:37:55.370">well wait really I'm trying to solve a problem here I'm trying to hold up this</p>
      <p begin="00:37:55.370" end="00:37:59.960">weight I'm trying to resist this kind of motion maybe I can</p>
      <p begin="00:37:59.960" end="00:38:04.420">represent something like that and actually have algorithms</p>
      <p begin="00:38:04.420" end="00:38:09.820">and computers design the part that does that well...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09.820" end="00:38:14.410">to my constraints and can create these incredibly complicated object without my having</p>
      <p begin="00:38:14.410" end="00:38:20.210">to specifically please every facet that's why there's so much possibility here</p>
      <p begin="00:38:20.210" end="00:38:24.920">you look at nature for an example and you can see that</p>
      <p begin="00:38:24.920" end="00:38:29.330">...solving problems that we need to solve...engineering to their finding things that have</p>
      <p begin="00:38:29.330" end="00:38:34.090">incredible strength to weight ratios by removing material they have</p>
      <p begin="00:38:34.090" end="00:38:38.060">...surface area of volume ratios if they're trying to create</p>
      <p begin="00:38:38.060" end="00:38:43.490">reactions and such and they do this through find micro structuring and problem,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:43.490" end="00:38:46.630">you know, methods that might seem random at first but in</p>
      <p begin="00:38:46.630" end="00:38:51.560">...very highly optimized and solve the problem exceedingly well?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:51.560" end="00:38:56.320">We really don't have tools right now to do this effectively these are the kinds of tools that we need to</p>
      <p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:38:57.390">create.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:57.390" end="00:39:01.880">And, when you look at this...in this really funny position</p>
      <p begin="00:39:01.880" end="00:39:07.450">where the hardware has actually exceeded the software which I mean seems</p>
      <p begin="00:39:07.450" end="00:39:12.900">crazy right I mean software developers l moore's law whatever we can we can be everybody right but,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:12.900" end="00:39:17.030">hardware suddenly coming along and say hey complexity is free?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:17.030" end="00:39:18.800">We can build as complex...</p>
      <p begin="00:39:18.800" end="00:39:24.830">is you want and the only prices the volume of material that you've put into the print will</p>
      <p begin="00:39:24.830" end="00:39:29.770">sadly that's not true for us computation is not free.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:29.770" end="00:39:32.810">Developing algorithms is not free.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:32.810" end="00:39:37.690">And,...to the point now where even though the printers can print these incredible things we don't</p>
      <p begin="00:39:37.690" end="00:39:42.250">even know-how to make them we don't even know what a transfer the data I've talked to designers who</p>
      <p begin="00:39:42.250" end="00:39:47.220">are on the leading edge of this stuff and they're creating files in traditional formats that are</p>
      <p begin="00:39:47.220" end="00:39:53.130">terabites and that's just not feasible we have to do better so</p>
      <p begin="00:39:53.130" end="00:39:56.780">that's where we're going with three mf we know that we need to fix this problem</p>
      <p begin="00:39:56.780" end="00:40:00.530">on interchange level to allow...developers to fix this on</p>
      <p begin="00:40:00.530" end="00:40:04.650">a design level so we're working on new methods of</p>
      <p begin="00:40:04.650" end="00:40:10.020">organizing data that are actually unique stuff that's truly new truly different</p>
      <p begin="00:40:10.020" end="00:40:12.180">so, we can actually represent micro structures</p>
      <p begin="00:40:12.180" end="00:40:17.680">...efficient way so we can do this stuff and actually create.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.680" end="00:40:21.660">New methods to look at data and in so doing</p>
      <p begin="00:40:21.660" end="00:40:25.310">create new ways of actually operating on that data more efficiently.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:27.080" end="00:40:31.760">I'm really excited to be working on this and I hope you'll stay tuned for the stuff that we</p>
      <p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:35.840">haven't in-store I can't really...yet because it's not ready we have to prove that</p>
      <p begin="00:40:35.840" end="00:40:39.960">...works we have to make some software that actually proves that are designs are</p>
      <p begin="00:40:39.960" end="00:40:44.800">good they'll really do what we can that...claim they'll be able to and then we will</p>

      <p begin="00:40:50.250" end="00:40:54.650">Hand the nice thing about this...ecosystem with all these companies involved is</p>
      <p begin="00:40:54.650" end="00:40:58.750">that now you...to worry you've got one format all the way down the pipeline from</p>

      <p begin="00:43:40.030" end="00:43:43.580">it would be easy for people to use a three-d scanner</p>

      <p begin="00:43:56.360" end="00:44:07.510">just the connect and, it will be exciting to get more of those pipelines coming in?</p>

      <p begin="00:44:32.870" end="00:44:35.010">Is that it could be fixed in software?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:36.080" end="00:44:40.790">Yeah, that is in fact that's one of the key things that were that were putting into the</p>

      <p begin="00:44:45.720" end="00:44:50.730">the material that part is probably shrinkage so some of</p>

      <p begin="00:44:56.120" end="00:45:01.000">like abs plastic so one of the materials that we're talking about putting in the materials</p>
      <p begin="00:45:01.000" end="00:45:05.030">...working with the print companies is what's the shrinkage so you could build</p>
      <p begin="00:45:05.030" end="00:45:07.090">...too big so that when it shrinks</p>
      <p begin="00:45:07.090" end="00:45:10.340">...to the right size as far as being too big I</p>
      <p begin="00:45:10.340" end="00:45:15.300">wrote caused that that's a little interesting probably just...printers off but shrinkage and thin</p>
      <p begin="00:45:15.300" end="00:45:19.430">wall ...was spacing all of these capabilities were trying to</p>
      <p begin="00:45:19.430" end="00:45:22.180">...industry together so that the printers can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:45:22.180" end="00:45:27.410">described them especially the professional printers can describe exactly what their capabilities are</p>
      <p begin="00:45:27.410" end="00:45:31.910">what we need to do to compensate for a variations like that, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:31.910" end="00:45:36.640">obviously...love the printer drivers themselves to be able to understand this and compensate on their own</p>
      <p begin="00:45:36.640" end="00:45:39.300">and I'm sure they'll be moving in that direction but part of the reason</p>
      <p begin="00:45:39.300" end="00:45:44.020">that we make these print capabilities available to apps is that if you want a very powerful app</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.020" end="00:45:47.150">they can get you the absolute best results on certain kinds of</p>
      <p begin="00:45:47.150" end="00:45:51.310">printers you'll be able to pull those capabilities out and do operations</p>
      <p begin="00:45:51.310" end="00:46:00.430">that you understand as the app developer will actually increase the quality of the final product?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:00.430" end="00:46:05.710">we have an application that...st old data I'm sure you recommend that we replace that with the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:05.710" end="00:46:10.460">three mf yes they're format but with will be any standard tools</p>
      <p begin="00:46:10.460" end="00:46:15.520">or windows support for doing conversion from...three-man so the way we look at</p>
      <p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:20.070">it actually is from...api perspective we simplify it by just basically</p>
      <p begin="00:46:20.070" end="00:46:24.130">say you can put in a vertex a triangle...something more generic more</p>
      <p begin="00:46:24.130" end="00:46:28.600">like your internal representation of the data and,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:28.600" end="00:46:32.340">that can be packaged automatically by the api...mf and,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:32.340" end="00:46:37.110">that way we worry more about the actual data representation that you're</p>
      <p begin="00:46:37.110" end="00:46:54.570">using in your program rather than going from one on-disk format to another.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:54.570" end="00:47:01.160">Okay, well, if there's no more questions certainly appreciate you coming please fill out your survey and.</p>
