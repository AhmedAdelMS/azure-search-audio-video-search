      <p begin="00:10:04.160" end="00:10:09.330">...that is very feature-rich like I showed you features like activity I show you</p>
      <p begin="00:10:09.330" end="00:10:14.130">...have I showed you chat I show you game dvr all those features are</p>
      <p begin="00:10:14.130" end="00:10:18.460">there and windows stan a...features are also windows phone ten</p>
      <p begin="00:10:18.460" end="00:10:23.190">on windows phone so you'll be able to get a lot of the same features on windows phone and,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:23.190" end="00:10:28.430">we're actually making sure that we keep as much...as we can across all of our experiences so,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:28.430" end="00:10:30.450">phone right now the only thing that's missing from</p>
      <p begin="00:10:30.450" end="00:10:35.920">phonemes game dvr if you get the windows ten bits of the windows phone ten bits you're not going</p>
      <p begin="00:10:35.920" end="00:10:41.030">to have game dvr there is something that we're looking at we're trying to figure out what the right experience would be there</p>
      <p begin="00:10:41.030" end="00:10:45.910">forforgave dvr and phone but it's something we continue to explore and you should expect improvements</p>
      <p begin="00:10:45.910" end="00:10:50.510">...so all those features right there you didn't have to a single line of code you</p>
      <p begin="00:10:50.510" end="00:10:56.450">didn't have to do a universal lap you didn't have to do anything and you're already going to benefit from that?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:56.450" end="00:10:59.730">Now there's other things are going to get just from moving on to win the stand,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:59.730" end="00:11:03.990">for example, when you bring your game...windows...you can now start running on direct</p>
      <p begin="00:11:03.990" end="00:11:08.780">...you recompile and you start putting your game to understand you'll get benefits from the platform itself</p>
      <p begin="00:11:08.780" end="00:11:13.560">this kind of operating system and platform features that you're going to get that you don't have...a</p>
      <p begin="00:11:13.560" end="00:11:17.080">...coda hopefully here everybody in the...familiar with</p>
      <p begin="00:11:17.080" end="00:11:21.690">...twelve right we announced last year these are new api for directory</p>
      <p begin="00:11:22.790" end="00:11:26.290">...direct...twelve would you get is a lot more control over how you</p>
      <p begin="00:11:26.290" end="00:11:31.050">render we have optimized are largely make sure that you have a lot of control and how you</p>
      <p begin="00:11:31.050" end="00:11:34.180">...the gpu so you can optimize rendering quite a bit</p>
      <p begin="00:11:34.180" end="00:11:38.150">...squeeze every ounce of performance from all of your games</p>
      <p begin="00:11:38.150" end="00:11:43.350">now if you're like me and you're right higher-level games like you ride on unity</p>
      <p begin="00:11:43.350" end="00:11:46.480">and real or any other higher-level frameworks miller's</p>
      <p begin="00:11:47.540" end="00:11:50.820">...all the middle providers are ready using direct</p>
      <p begin="00:11:50.820" end="00:11:55.580">...and you're going to benefit from everything they do so in your case you're just going to get the</p>
      <p begin="00:11:55.580" end="00:12:00.510">benefit for free you get more performance you'll get better rendering for free by just using libraries that</p>
      <p begin="00:12:00.510" end="00:12:06.030">already taken advantage of direct and other area where we made significant improvements the use</p>
      <p begin="00:12:06.030" end="00:12:10.930">of developer would benefit from just from moving to understand is...case...the case</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.930" end="00:12:15.940">or significantly larger today than they were a year-ago just for context you I</p>
      <p begin="00:12:15.940" end="00:12:21.270">don't have the numbers because they're never accurate and we were shy about it but just for context</p>
      <p begin="00:12:21.270" end="00:12:26.890">...grew over...thousand new api think about it we brought in aps from consul</p>
      <p begin="00:12:26.890" end="00:12:31.430">we were aps from phone we had all these windows api already so we do over</p>
      <p begin="00:12:31.430" end="00:12:36.240">...thousand api that's probably one of our largest updates ever and that's just...the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:38.070">...tci on the dominates</p>
      <p begin="00:12:38.070" end="00:12:41.860">...we also...about two thousand api is and,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:41.860" end="00:12:46.830">what we did there is remember we have different profile so we have...on the desktop and we brought a</p>
      <p begin="00:12:46.830" end="00:12:51.830">lot of those api says to the you windows store today actual universal</p>
      <p begin="00:12:51.830" end="00:12:57.000">platform so that you would have better compatibility across right if you seen the profiles</p>
      <p begin="00:12:57.000" end="00:13:01.160">...a few classes that people are saying well I wish I could use this class over there so I don't have</p>
      <p begin="00:13:01.160" end="00:13:05.980">thread my code and I can share more coded desktops we've done that we brought in two thousand and we will</p>
      <p begin="00:13:05.980" end="00:13:11.100">continue to bring more api as we go forward now...and...in we can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:13:11.100" end="00:13:15.030">ad api much faster than we've ever been before in the past it's always been</p>
      <p begin="00:13:15.030" end="00:13:17.120">...all we cannot do that because we are</p>
      <p begin="00:13:17.120" end="00:13:21.410">...a hole in the framework which sliding now we can start adding more libraries for</p>
      <p begin="00:13:21.410" end="00:13:26.670">you as we go and will continue to do these as we go and the last one that I want to highlight is the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:26.670" end="00:13:30.950">wing thirty-two and comic...this one special to me because here we</p>
      <p begin="00:13:30.950" end="00:13:35.030">brought only about a thousand api...but those api are ones that really,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:35.030" end="00:13:38.940">really matter for asses gamers this is some of the work that we've done</p>
      <p begin="00:13:38.940" end="00:13:43.610">...the last year with unity and unreal and marmalade...of middleware</p>
      <p begin="00:13:43.610" end="00:13:48.700">is an...media and other part is...related to gaming the came and said look the universe</p>
      <p begin="00:13:48.700" end="00:13:53.090">...platform is great but I really wish we had these api stings that matter a lot,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:53.090" end="00:13:55.760">for example, threading?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:55.760" end="00:14:00.650">Sockets right if you are here two years ago and you hear about platform you are lego</p>
      <p begin="00:14:00.650" end="00:14:04.250">...sockets that's weird right and we didn't make sense to all of us</p>
      <p begin="00:14:04.250" end="00:14:09.160">...gamers he was a pain to have to rewrite well we've heard you were bringing all those backs and those are</p>
      <p begin="00:14:09.160" end="00:14:13.530">the thousand api so even to the number is not...standing it's a number that really,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:13.530" end="00:14:17.810">really matters heap virtual-memory things that we are really,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:17.810" end="00:14:22.300">really hard to do if you don't get the...system level api so those are the ones that we</p>
      <p begin="00:14:22.300" end="00:14:27.230">focused on I'm not going to talk much about media but,...because there's a lot of sessions and</p>
      <p begin="00:14:27.230" end="00:14:28.530">bil about it but,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:28.530" end="00:14:33.400">to improvements I wanted high...low latency video low latency audio that's common</p>
      <p begin="00:14:33.400" end="00:14:37.810">pain and...decrees latency is down to...so for those of you who have in the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:37.810" end="00:14:43.780">past I've really one lower latency audio we no longer buffer so you can really control how much</p>
      <p begin="00:14:43.780" end="00:14:49.180">...there and how like how low your latency is...we also added a myriad of...api</p>
      <p begin="00:14:49.180" end="00:14:54.310">...there...have a session tomorrow and, we always my big favor some make sure you come to</p>

      <p begin="00:15:04.950" end="00:15:09.920">...and give you the update on the aps have changed from last year and how we are with</p>

      <p begin="00:15:27.320" end="00:15:33.100">seen the slide this is actually the new universal windows platforms</p>
      <p begin="00:15:33.100" end="00:15:38.320">...showing around I saw these lie five years ago when we introduce windows phone</p>
      <p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:43.620">...these light three years ago when we call the winner t the point here is the platform</p>
      <p begin="00:15:43.620" end="00:15:46.960">...change everything that we have in here there's a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:15:46.960" end="00:15:50.640">...don't get me wrong I can go in there to...you go through sessions and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:50.640" end="00:15:55.870">build the rescission up model and you'll go in and care about new background in api</p>
      <p begin="00:15:55.870" end="00:15:57.310">...packaging and you're going</p>
      <p begin="00:15:57.310" end="00:16:02.080">to hear about how we increase the package sizes of the now we can fit any game because the package</p>
      <p begin="00:16:02.080" end="00:16:06.720">...sizes are so large...via social in the store and we gotta talk about the one store</p>
      <p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:11.230">...session on tools are going to talk about graphics the bloggers and all sorts of different tools</p>
      <p begin="00:16:11.230" end="00:16:15.760">...coming for game so he's the exact same platform your familiar and...continue to</p>
      <p begin="00:16:15.760" end="00:16:18.680">...just because I'm not going to spend a lot of time and these</p>
      <p begin="00:16:18.680" end="00:16:23.050">...before you'll have three days full of sessions here and there's some</p>
      <p begin="00:16:23.050" end="00:16:28.820">sessions that I highlighted as a reference here and you'll see them as a reference at the end at the end of the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:28.820" end="00:16:34.000">presentation let's go to our games because that's what we want to get into so we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:38.640">...game from windows store on to windows...and that's where</p>
      <p begin="00:16:39.650" end="00:16:44.380">...introduces two-game I can do that switch over to my machine so this is</p>
      <p begin="00:16:44.380" end="00:16:47.770">a game that we...to really simple demo in the whole point of the demo</p>
      <p begin="00:16:47.770" end="00:16:52.210">...to teach students how to write video games so you're not going to see the most flashy</p>
      <p begin="00:16:52.210" end="00:16:57.700">...follows thing ever here it's going to be very simple game so we have here to start is</p>
      <p begin="00:16:57.700" end="00:17:03.010">...show you the game running as a windows eight application in windows ten so</p>
      <p begin="00:17:03.010" end="00:17:07.740">...here to run the app as it exists you can see it starts off and you can hear the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:07.740" end="00:17:12.580">background music somewhere coming out of the here that okay I don't know if it's in my hedges</p>
      <p begin="00:17:12.580" end="00:17:17.450">I played so much organs actually coming out of a speaker so you can tell this is a windows</p>
      <p begin="00:17:17.450" end="00:17:21.920">...app on windows ten because at the top left you get the hamburger menu that has what used to be on the charms</p>
      <p begin="00:17:21.920" end="00:17:24.680">...get the button over on the right that allows you to put</p>
      <p begin="00:17:24.680" end="00:17:29.360">...full-screen which is how windows runtime...used to run they were always bolstering</p>
      <p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:33.450">but because this is windows ten is actually lives in a window you can move it around the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:33.450" end="00:17:37.520">strength so what we need to do is to turn this into a windows</p>
      <p begin="00:17:37.520" end="00:17:42.730">...so to do that what I did was I created a new universal</p>
      <p begin="00:17:42.730" end="00:17:47.720">app project and I brought my code over I didn't I didn't change anything I literally just</p>
      <p begin="00:17:47.720" end="00:17:52.400">...and pasted the code as we go for a add a link over here and we have the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:52.400" end="00:17:56.580">exact same code running just with the universal wrapper radish basically as a new package</p>
      <p begin="00:17:56.580" end="00:18:03.740">manifest and whatnot so if I run this version of the app as a windows ten app.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:03.740" end="00:18:05.960">I showed you on the phone first because.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:07.190" end="00:18:09.240">The...similar to windows eight,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:09.240" end="00:18:12.900">you know, the phone always runs full-screen there are no windows there are no concept</p>
      <p begin="00:18:12.900" end="00:18:16.910">...so you can see this is now running in the windows ten phone emulator as universal</p>
      <p begin="00:18:16.910" end="00:18:24.030">lab I can go in here and I can actually play the game all tap start so</p>
      <p begin="00:18:24.030" end="00:18:28.760">it's a very simple game you very as simple...game here a little blue monster</p>
      <p begin="00:18:28.760" end="00:18:32.940">I'm controlling the read monster chasing the around the glowing icons in the corners</p>
      <p begin="00:18:32.940" end="00:18:38.070">are windows ten features and the point of the exerciser students is that every time they add</p>
      <p begin="00:18:38.070" end="00:18:43.060">a new windows ten feature to the game...new icon as well so your goal is to run around and eat those</p>
      <p begin="00:18:43.060" end="00:18:47.170">of glowing icons because they're worth more points than the regular dots</p>
      <p begin="00:18:47.170" end="00:18:50.960">...you can see runs on in windows phone and everything is happy...a full-screen app</p>
      <p begin="00:18:50.960" end="00:18:58.570">but when you move to windows ten there are other considerations to deal with windows yep.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:58.570" end="00:19:00.440">...we can switch.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:00.440" end="00:19:05.550">We got this switch back and area so, windows stand</p>
      <p begin="00:19:05.550" end="00:19:10.250">write-in windows a...tools...you could snap...he was always full-screen your</p>
      <p begin="00:19:10.250" end="00:19:15.080">apt enough to worry about windows, windows stand first of all you still have control</p>
      <p begin="00:19:15.080" end="00:19:19.560">so if you...your game to run a full-screen great we give you are api that you can program marilee</p>
      <p begin="00:19:19.560" end="00:19:23.450">call...screen mode right if you...your api</p>
      <p begin="00:19:23.450" end="00:19:28.290">two-run a specific aspect ratio we give you an api that can...hey here's my preferred size here's</p>
      <p begin="00:19:28.290" end="00:19:33.210">my minimum size...give you a lot of control that said ultimate control</p>
      <p begin="00:19:33.210" end="00:19:37.280">...with the user so the user can at some point decide look I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:37.280" end="00:19:42.390">...these we know from here over here and I'm going to put it right here and he's going to be decides</p>
      <p begin="00:19:42.390" end="00:19:46.670">therefore as you ride or as you make as you move your move your game from windows eight on to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:46.670" end="00:19:49.590">...ten you will have to support window</p>
      <p begin="00:19:49.590" end="00:19:53.560">and if you do support window in we recommend that you actually, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:53.560" end="00:19:57.910">make sure you handle full-screen...and, another thing that you actually have to do</p>
      <p begin="00:19:57.910" end="00:20:02.560">...support activation in the activation now we run in windowed the user can have</p>
      <p begin="00:20:02.560" end="00:20:07.460">to windows and you-are-there your baseball and then the user goes in and clicks on email or, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:07.460" end="00:20:12.420">whatever it is facebook...a message or something and you lost focus and you need to make sure you...</p>
      <p begin="00:20:12.420" end="00:20:17.520">you games so you need to make sure you handle the activated and the activated event in your game and,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:22.510">it's pretty...so brand one you add that to the games which back over and show you how to do that so this is</p>
      <p begin="00:20:22.510" end="00:20:27.360">the same project haven't changed anything which toggle back and forth ...in a jump into the main</p>
      <p begin="00:20:27.360" end="00:20:32.610">...a model game application amount of game games if you're familiar with the architecture</p>
      <p begin="00:20:32.610" end="00:20:37.020">their this will be familiar to you so the first thing we're going to do here roger let me-let me run</p>
      <p begin="00:20:37.020" end="00:20:43.150">it without making a single code change so you'll see it running in windows ten in a window.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:43.150" end="00:20:47.910">So, it starts up that this was the last size that the window when the user</p>
      <p begin="00:20:47.910" end="00:20:52.900">close the application this was the size that they had the window so you can dragging to make a bigger smaller but,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:52.900" end="00:20:56.990">for example, we can come in here and say we want to have always...at</p>
      <p begin="00:20:56.990" end="00:21:01.760">a specific size so there's a new class that exists here in windows ten called application</p>
      <p begin="00:21:01.760" end="00:21:06.420">view if you look at the intelligence on this we get a few things here we can set</p>
      <p begin="00:21:06.420" end="00:21:11.210">the preferred launch size we can set the preferred when doing mode and things like that but we're after</p>
      <p begin="00:21:11.210" end="00:21:16.370">is we're going to get the view for the application view for the current window...a culture</p>
      <p begin="00:21:16.370" end="00:21:21.760">I resize...going to pass in a new size and I'm going to this game resin nineteen twenty by ten eighty-some</p>
      <p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:27.430">...in fifty percent of that so it's going to run basically...window that's about half the size of the screen</p>
      <p begin="00:21:27.430" end="00:21:32.200">...see this is called try resize view will find a variety of these method methods that start with</p>
      <p begin="00:21:32.200" end="00:21:37.130">try...return boolean to you so you can tell whether or not you successfully</p>
      <p begin="00:21:37.130" end="00:21:41.720">resize reason for this is...resize you doesn't necessarily make sense all</p>
      <p begin="00:21:41.720" end="00:21:47.360">platforms you can't resize the window and phone calls phone is always full-screen when you're in</p>
      <p begin="00:21:47.360" end="00:21:50.850">tablet mode on a touch device everything is always full-screen so this is an</p>
      <p begin="00:21:50.850" end="00:21:55.950">...exception will just tell you all I didn't change view so if you need to do something because of that I</p>
      <p begin="00:21:55.950" end="00:22:00.670">failed so with that in place we can run the app now you'll see the app</p>
      <p begin="00:22:00.670" end="00:22:04.470">resize so we'll start out a certain screen size and then shrink?</p>
      <p begin="00:22:05.480" end="00:22:08.170">Or growth order actually I'm probably was already at that size</p>
      <p begin="00:22:08.170" end="00:22:11.760">let me go ahead and make the window bigger and close.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:12.870" end="00:22:18.970">So, it saves that new size...again.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:18.970" end="00:22:23.450">And, I see the window...shrunk down to that specific size that we set as</p>
      <p begin="00:22:23.450" end="00:22:25.330">a couple of things that hang off if...this is</p>
      <p begin="00:22:25.330" end="00:22:31.800">try resize view we can set we can figure out if they if it's been snapped the left</p>
      <p begin="00:22:31.800" end="00:22:36.800">side or snap to the right side of the screen we can get the title bar inset the title bar we can</p>
      <p begin="00:22:36.800" end="00:22:41.780">set that preferred minimum size and one of the a variety of things here that you can mess around with.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:41.780" end="00:22:46.900">So, that's the way to resize...thing we want to...full-screen visit the game</p>
      <p begin="00:22:46.900" end="00:22:53.170">issued you...support full-screen so I've already...a little bit of code here to handle the input so</p>
      <p begin="00:22:53.170" end="00:22:57.570">...I'm listening for the f eleven key so my input manager class here</p>
      <p begin="00:22:57.570" end="00:23:02.540">will let-me know when someone has press the f eleven key and when that happens again I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:23:02.540" end="00:23:06.510">a use that same application view object and I'm going to check the is full-screen</p>
      <p begin="00:23:06.510" end="00:23:10.150">...this is true already in full-screen if it's false we need</p>
      <p begin="00:23:10.150" end="00:23:14.610">enter full-screen so simple toggle here if we're full-screen we're going to...full-screen</p>
      <p begin="00:23:14.610" end="00:23:19.680">mode if we're not we're going to enter full-screen mode again you'll see here there's another method with</p>
      <p begin="00:23:19.680" end="00:23:24.910">...try so this is going to return boolean that's going to tell you whether or not it succeeded?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:24.910" end="00:23:29.470">So, if we run the app this way you'll see it'll start out in a window.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:29.470" end="00:23:31.420">And, I can press eleven here</p>
      <p begin="00:23:31.420" end="00:23:35.110">...to full-screen press...eleven toggle back.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:35.110" end="00:23:39.040">Just that simple to do it of course you can, you know, call this the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:39.040" end="00:23:41.610">...you...as the preferred method whatever you want</p>
      <p begin="00:23:41.610" end="00:23:46.030">...but always give the user the option to be able to toggle back and forth everything here is a window</p>
      <p begin="00:23:46.030" end="00:23:51.860">now and not everything leaves and full-screen world so in the final thing is highly mention was activation</p>
      <p begin="00:23:51.860" end="00:23:53.310">...activation so</p>
      <p begin="00:23:53.310" end="00:23:58.310">model game handles this a little bit for us so let me show you the code as it exists and model game in the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:58.310" end="00:24:03.790">game window class so what they do is hook into core window every windows eight</p>
      <p begin="00:24:03.790" end="00:24:08.590">and windows ten application has a core window and there's a dot activated event so we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:24:08.590" end="00:24:13.350">hook that event and basically check the windows activated...arts here if it...to</p>
      <p begin="00:24:13.350" end="00:24:18.450">the activated we set our is our global is active property to false</p>
      <p begin="00:24:18.450" end="00:24:23.240">if it comes...activated we said is active true so</p>
      <p begin="00:24:23.240" end="00:24:30.320">whoops back in my code here all on comment this junk?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:30.320" end="00:24:35.200">I check here in my update loop if I'm active then I'm going to resume any sound</p>
      <p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:40.000">effects that I had...from becoming the activated and I'm going to call the logic in order to update my</p>

      <p begin="00:24:41.050" end="00:24:46.150">Otherwise if I'm not active I'm going to pause all sound effects and...update isn't going to happen because it's not part of</p>
      <p begin="00:24:46.150" end="00:24:51.540">...so many turn the music back on here say...able to.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:51.540" end="00:24:53.960">Here the music start and stop.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:53.960" end="00:24:58.360">...the app with this in place.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:58.360" end="00:25:03.840">So, annoying title screen...a we go back to visual studio music stops go back to the</p>

      <p begin="00:25:04.340" end="00:25:11.270">continue you can see here we'll start the game let the monster run to a certain position.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:11.270" end="00:25:16.420">And, we'll stop music stop...a couple seconds we go back you'll see the read monster will be and exact spot</p>
      <p begin="00:25:16.420" end="00:25:22.020">...it...worth handling the activated enrollment.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:22.020" end="00:25:26.560">So, that's window and bets full-screen and that is</p>

      <p begin="00:25:50.060" end="00:25:54.430">as telling you how to handle when knowing is not the heavy lifting you will still have to come up with</p>
      <p begin="00:25:54.430" end="00:25:57.760">the design strategy for-you game...to decide well when</p>
      <p begin="00:25:57.760" end="00:26:02.310">...full-screen I want to scale the content or maybe I want to create an adaptive layout or I want, you know,</p>

      <p begin="00:26:06.670" end="00:26:11.380">hour but, the viewed at the...you is that we've already recorded that add</p>
      <p begin="00:26:11.380" end="00:26:16.620">...a month-and-a-half ago we told williams from the fable team cayman...</p>
      <p begin="00:26:16.620" end="00:26:21.440">session the say hey here's, you know, what you need to think about here's all the options...you should be considering</p>
      <p begin="00:26:21.440" end="00:26:26.950">so, watch the whole session and then from there you'll come up with the strategy the platform supports everything and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:26.950" end="00:26:31.870">... the way I think about games most guys will have maybe a combination like in some cases you'll just</p>
      <p begin="00:26:31.870" end="00:26:35.590">want to scale but often you'll have to do scaling and either and,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:35.590" end="00:26:39.120">that adaptive layout or something else along with a along with it so,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:43.440">...platform support everything and you don't have to do lab a huge amount of rework because</p>
      <p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:48.330">you've been thinking about these problems wherever in other platforms and it's going to be able to...you</p>
      <p begin="00:26:48.330" end="00:26:53.350">can be able to bring those same patterns on to our platform no problem I just wanted to point out the video from</p>
      <p begin="00:26:53.350" end="00:26:56.930">...because it's really useful now the next thing window</p>
      <p begin="00:26:56.930" end="00:27:01.820">in the beginning the next thing we talked about when we did the outline was...</p>
      <p begin="00:27:01.820" end="00:27:06.770">we are handle input and, we thought about two things the first one is</p>
      <p begin="00:27:06.770" end="00:27:12.280">...what's...pointer or what change and mouse in touch if you remember windows</p>
      <p begin="00:27:12.280" end="00:27:16.250">windows store two years ago we came back we said look we're always going to</p>
      <p begin="00:27:16.250" end="00:27:20.660">make touch seamless along with mouse so we're going to aggregate those into these one class</p>
      <p begin="00:27:20.660" end="00:27:24.980">called pointer api and regardless of where the user I use in touch or whether</p>
      <p begin="00:27:24.980" end="00:27:30.100">...mouse it's all going to pointer so as long as you handle pointer you'll be taken care of and if you've</p>
      <p begin="00:27:30.100" end="00:27:35.000">been writing games you been using this pattern for the last two years nothing there changes with the universal</p>
      <p begin="00:27:35.000" end="00:27:39.940">in this platform we've added some really cool features to inc and other area so we've added improvements but for</p>
      <p begin="00:27:39.940" end="00:27:44.870">your games he didn't have to change anything in the game so there was nothing to say right there on</p>
      <p begin="00:27:44.870" end="00:27:45.340">miles and</p>
      <p begin="00:27:45.340" end="00:27:50.050">...and touch so moving on to text we have a lot of improvements</p>
      <p begin="00:27:50.050" end="00:27:54.290">and text them I spend a lot of...in the last two years</p>
      <p begin="00:27:54.290" end="00:27:59.720">...other platforms and windows and...was one of my biggest paints has anybody ever</p>
      <p begin="00:27:59.720" end="00:28:03.180">here like how to do text on their games and then have to maybe</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.180" end="00:28:08.560">hackett text box where you put a hidden textbook somewhere and you just that focus to it</p>
      <p begin="00:28:08.560" end="00:28:12.810">...would come out right or some of as we go as far as you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:12.810" end="00:28:17.440">pretending to be a textbook throughout summation peer and actually doing that most of those</p>
      <p begin="00:28:17.440" end="00:28:22.290">work-arounds were solvable and they worked but it was always clergy and always feel like there's gotta</p>
      <p begin="00:28:22.290" end="00:28:26.510">be an easier way to do it and today with the universal windows platform we have</p>
      <p begin="00:28:26.510" end="00:28:30.920">the easier way to do it here's we're going to give you there's an input...class?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:30.920" end="00:28:35.150">And, that input campaign class you have control over when you show it you have</p>
      <p begin="00:28:35.150" end="00:28:39.580">...when you hide it when you do show it when we do show it or even when the user</p>
      <p begin="00:28:39.580" end="00:28:43.690">tops on with touch and...comes up you get...that says this is</p>
      <p begin="00:28:43.690" end="00:28:48.500">showing so now, you know, how to affect your game you can parser game you also get the coordinate system</p>
      <p begin="00:28:48.500" end="00:28:53.350">if the input...is dot you get...sizes hey here's how much of the area we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:28:53.350" end="00:28:58.110">include so you have full control over how you handle keyboard no, more</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58.110" end="00:29:03.000">of those hacks no more of that code and it's relatively easy to shows...when we go ahead and code that</p>
      <p begin="00:29:03.000" end="00:29:08.150">yep so have you noticed on the menu for my game there was an option for enter name where you can put in your name and</p>
      <p begin="00:29:08.150" end="00:29:12.940">the character role recognize us that name puts it up in the score display so to do that I've got a</p>
      <p begin="00:29:12.940" end="00:29:16.210">very simple dialogue box that I wrote it's all written model game it's not a windows</p>
      <p begin="00:29:16.210" end="00:29:21.460">dialogue box and basically what I call the show method from my game I called input</p>
      <p begin="00:29:21.460" end="00:29:26.130">...current wvu dot try show and when I call hide of my dialogue box I call try</p>
      <p begin="00:29:26.130" end="00:29:30.890">...again these are try method to get the boolean it tells you whether or not it's available or whether out</p>
      <p begin="00:29:30.890" end="00:29:35.570">...succeeded and the reason for this is if you're on a desktop and you have a keyboard connected</p>
      <p begin="00:29:35.570" end="00:29:39.910">it's not going to pop-up advice there's like a...the input...touch-screen it's not going to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:39.910" end="00:29:44.390">...the input painters you can't touch and on touch-screen screen so in this case</p>
      <p begin="00:29:44.390" end="00:29:50.120">...I'm going to do is I'm going to set my laptop here to tablet mode so the app now we'll start-up in a</p>

      <p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:03.640">type my name in this box and you see shows up in the top right corner presenter and what's</p>
      <p begin="00:30:03.640" end="00:30:07.650">right is this response to all the standard keyboard events that you're already used to so if you've already</p>
      <p begin="00:30:07.650" end="00:30:12.520">written regain to support keyboard you already...game to support input...you just actually need to show in</p>
      <p begin="00:30:12.520" end="00:30:16.650">...that's all I need to...very simple?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:16.650" end="00:30:21.890">To lines of code ic...some friends that are work within the past and we've implemented adoration</p>
      <p begin="00:30:21.890" end="00:30:23.390">...was couple hundred lines of code</p>

      <p begin="00:30:28.100" end="00:30:32.500">...reference ...even now we've got in there and it's in the platform</p>
      <p begin="00:30:32.500" end="00:30:36.830">...to user going forward so another area would input of</p>
      <p begin="00:30:36.830" end="00:30:41.500">course is now that we have these myriad these huge family of devices we need to worry about the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:41.500" end="00:30:46.310">controller and, here's a good example of where we bring and how the universal</p>
      <p begin="00:30:46.310" end="00:30:51.760">...platform brings the best stuff from everywhere we've always had...input on the desktop pretty popular</p>
      <p begin="00:30:51.760" end="00:30:56.640">great api servers well for a few years is very simple...powerful</p>
      <p begin="00:30:56.640" end="00:31:00.890">now the xbox had a game pad class and they been working...for the last</p>
      <p begin="00:31:00.890" end="00:31:06.110">...years is more modern it has in my opinion a better object model it was more future proof for</p>
      <p begin="00:31:06.110" end="00:31:09.120">...we felt like hey we gotta bring the best</p>
      <p begin="00:31:09.120" end="00:31:13.660">of breed api and this was a hard choice because we were like lx employees use everywhere it's on desktop</p>
      <p begin="00:31:13.660" end="00:31:18.480">...all that but we finally said hey, you know, game...is the better api is the one that we're</p>
      <p begin="00:31:18.480" end="00:31:22.900">getting best into the future so let's bring that...the universal...platform and that's</p>
      <p begin="00:31:22.900" end="00:31:26.830">we're going-to we're going-to be using going forward now with the game</p>
      <p begin="00:31:26.830" end="00:31:31.340">...julio to support and all platforms a windows mobile desktop xbox</p>
      <p begin="00:31:31.340" end="00:31:35.480">one all of them we supported but if we come up with a new classroom later</p>
      <p begin="00:31:35.480" end="00:31:38.970">...comptroller make sense we're going to use these api and this is the one they were</p>
      <p begin="00:31:38.970" end="00:31:42.940">going to stick to so you'll be able to continue leverage the knowledge and the coded you</p>
      <p begin="00:31:42.940" end="00:31:46.320">have the api feature-rich so multiple game</p>
      <p begin="00:31:46.320" end="00:31:51.830">paths headset everything that you expect...from the game part is all there now for those of you that we're</p>
      <p begin="00:31:51.830" end="00:31:55.720">using x...what we've done is we said look we don't want you to</p>
      <p begin="00:31:55.720" end="00:31:59.140">throw-away all your code so why don't we rapid...a little wrapper</p>
      <p begin="00:31:59.140" end="00:32:03.750">input was very simple it only have five met that so we create a wrapper that actually goes</p>
      <p begin="00:32:03.750" end="00:32:06.500">...underneath the seen it actually uses all the game</p>
      <p begin="00:32:06.500" end="00:32:11.250">...api but it gives you the method signatures for ex inputs...our way for you...</p>
      <p begin="00:32:11.250" end="00:32:16.780">you include the header you just swapped library that...link against and you're done right so very easy for you</p>
      <p begin="00:32:16.780" end="00:32:19.630">...your game and very easy for you actually reuse your</p>
      <p begin="00:32:19.630" end="00:32:24.395">...without doing anything now I do have to give you a caveat on the bills are going</p>
      <p begin="00:32:24.395" end="00:32:27.420">to get this week game part is not in their the api</p>
      <p begin="00:32:27.420" end="00:32:31.690">...but they're not implemented so again just wait a little bit until the first</p>
      <p begin="00:32:31.690" end="00:32:34.870">flied or the next slide where this comes in and then you'll be able to have them by</p>
      <p begin="00:32:34.870" end="00:32:38.740">rpm it's a very simple api anybody here has been used in</p>
      <p begin="00:32:38.740" end="00:32:45.990">xbox is the exact same api as we didn't change the name so you'll be able to user code very easily?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:45.990" end="00:32:51.420">...there we could be done but they tell us we...feel a sixty-minutes words that.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:51.420" end="00:32:56.030">In my opinion you just handle everything you need to have a good game right you had a good</p>
      <p begin="00:32:56.030" end="00:33:00.440">game plea to begin with even to o'brien's is questionable...simple by</p>
      <p begin="00:33:00.440" end="00:33:05.360">the sine but we had a template to begin with so we added the window in we added all the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:10.130">input...there we can start taking advantage of new features and here</p>
      <p begin="00:33:10.130" end="00:33:12.720">we go ahead and go for the big enchilada the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:12.720" end="00:33:17.330">release huge innovation that we have for gamers on...stand and that's xbox</p>
      <p begin="00:33:17.330" end="00:33:22.030">...everybody here's familiar with expert live services right.</p>

      <p begin="00:33:25.920" end="00:33:30.020">...services that have been proven the scale they've been really,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:30.020" end="00:33:35.000">really solid we have lessons or a...several years of...learning api so let me tell</p>

      <p begin="00:33:44.960" end="00:33:49.690">their game pleats pretty much everything that I show you on that xbox up all of</p>
      <p begin="00:33:49.690" end="00:33:54.130">that functionality comes without any and profile and you're going to get all that.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:54.130" end="00:33:59.070">The next never bringing is the data platforms so that if you want to write achievements in get</p>
      <p begin="00:33:59.070" end="00:34:01.840">...activity and do a lot with the data</p>
      <p begin="00:34:01.840" end="00:34:06.250">you'll also get all that and then the last time we think that</p>
      <p begin="00:34:06.250" end="00:34:09.640">...you is multiplayer now if you're familiar with expert</p>
      <p begin="00:34:09.640" end="00:34:14.480">...that's everything so we're bringing all the services were giving you the same api</p>
      <p begin="00:34:14.480" end="00:34:19.490">or equivalent api...and you'll have feature parity as we go across the obviously</p>
      <p begin="00:34:19.490" end="00:34:23.790">will do the right thing by the form factor would not everything makes sense and every device</p>
      <p begin="00:34:23.790" end="00:34:29.140">...our intent is to bring there's many things as we can such that the platform you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:29.140" end="00:34:32.340">benefits from and having the feature and he doesn't that you're</p>
      <p begin="00:34:32.340" end="00:34:36.350">meant to the overall experience because we won the user to have a great experience across</p>
      <p begin="00:34:36.350" end="00:34:39.920">the whole device family so, we</p>
      <p begin="00:34:39.920" end="00:34:44.410">...bryan how hard is it to add xbox live onto our</p>
      <p begin="00:34:44.410" end="00:34:48.860">game it's pretty simple so xbox live right now is distributed as a</p>
      <p begin="00:34:48.860" end="00:34:53.710">new get package so you download that and I've already done the done the back and workers can</p>
      <p begin="00:34:53.710" end="00:34:59.850">see my packages dot configure I have a reference to...xbox live sdk so the</p>
      <p begin="00:34:59.850" end="00:35:05.050">...that makes sense to do when you're reading your...you want to have people sign it</p>
      <p begin="00:35:05.050" end="00:35:09.840">...you want to get their profiler gamer tag...that information so that's what we'll do this game so</p>
      <p begin="00:35:09.840" end="00:35:12.520">extremely simple you grab the user object</p>
      <p begin="00:35:12.520" end="00:35:16.270">here listen microsoft xbox services system call sign in</p>
      <p begin="00:35:16.270" end="00:35:20.120">...that's going to return to you and xbox user object</p>
      <p begin="00:35:20.120" end="00:35:24.300">welcome from there the next thing we need is an xbox live context for that</p>
      <p begin="00:35:24.300" end="00:35:29.370">user the context object is basically your interface for every service that you</p>
      <p begin="00:35:29.370" end="00:35:32.120">...talk to so you create one simply by</p>
      <p begin="00:35:32.120" end="00:35:36.160">doing it and passing in the user that you want associated with the context?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:36.160" end="00:35:41.100">And, then to pullback...information...going to call into the profile service as I said all these live off of</p>
      <p begin="00:35:41.100" end="00:35:45.320">context if we look at intel...the...service leader board matchmaking</p>
      <p begin="00:35:45.320" end="00:35:50.560">presence every service lives off of context so we're use the profile service and call get</p>
      <p begin="00:35:50.560" end="00:35:55.340">user profile asic passing in the xbox user id of the person that we just signed</p>
      <p begin="00:35:55.340" end="00:35:59.120">it we're going...back from there is a profile object and</p>
      <p begin="00:35:59.120" end="00:36:04.980">off the profile object you can grab a variety of things...</p>
      <p begin="00:36:04.980" end="00:36:09.190">You can get the account...serve their gold or silver you can get their current gamer score</p>
      <p begin="00:36:09.190" end="00:36:13.040">they're gamer tag they're user id the xbox</p>
      <p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:17.840">user id which is just a unique identifier that identifies them to xbox live.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:17.840" end="00:36:22.600">So, what we care about is the gamer tag we're going to sign that to our gamer tag property and the gamer pick</p>
      <p begin="00:36:22.600" end="00:36:27.390">...display both of those things in the top right corner of our screen gamer pick as handed to you as a</p>

      <p begin="00:36:34.230" end="00:36:39.030">their full-size gamer pick so I just wrote a tracker code here that converted to something that</p>
      <p begin="00:36:39.030" end="00:36:42.590">model gain can use which is a texture...and I sign that to my gamer</p>
      <p begin="00:36:42.590" end="00:36:48.160">...so if I go back to my original monster game here I'm going to on comment</p>

      <p begin="00:40:58.200" end="00:41:03.050">another five gigabytes of data edges because you change achievements or anything like that and your game so, that's</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03.050" end="00:41:08.480">...data platform is very cool and, let's see we can do it achievements right...</p>
      <p begin="00:41:08.480" end="00:41:13.530">...show a sample are how to do leader boards and achievement so I've defined a leader</p>
      <p begin="00:41:13.530" end="00:41:17.070">...I've defined event data for my game as I said it can be anything I had</p>
      <p begin="00:41:17.070" end="00:41:22.030">to be the number of times the ...many dot soybeans that's kind of like my score</p>
      <p begin="00:41:22.030" end="00:41:25.730">so I've got data already that's that leaves up on xbox live it already</p>
      <p begin="00:41:25.730" end="00:41:30.460">lives in my leader board we just want to display the leader board on the screen so to do that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:30.460" end="00:41:34.260">...not switch there we go...which.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:34.260" end="00:41:38.370">Have a method here called get...board a single right passing the name of the leader board that I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:41:38.370" end="00:41:41.250">retrieved from xbox live and it's</p>
      <p begin="00:41:41.250" end="00:41:45.330">really just one line of code to pull back the leader board I use that context object again</p>
      <p begin="00:41:45.330" end="00:41:50.230">...that's the interfaced all of our services...the leader board service get lear board a</p>

      <p begin="00:41:55.910" end="00:41:59.200">inside there I'm...have a collection of rows and rows going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:02.830">one-line of the leader board so what I care about is I'm going to pull the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:02.830" end="00:42:06.540">ranked that's first second third fourth...online the gamer</p>
      <p begin="00:42:06.540" end="00:42:11.530">tagging person at that rank and then this item has the value...item collection</p>
      <p begin="00:42:11.530" end="00:42:16.490">has a series of values that are the events that I told it to track for might</p>
      <p begin="00:42:16.490" end="00:42:21.700">...board so, are, you know, that the zero with element of that is the thing that I want to display</p>
      <p begin="00:42:21.700" end="00:42:25.710">...board so I had all those things to a collection and then display them on the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:25.710" end="00:42:33.410">screen so if I run my app here and balance down to leader board?</p>
      <p begin="00:42:33.410" end="00:42:36.040">It went up the server actually very fast</p>
      <p begin="00:42:36.040" end="00:42:40.070">and, pull back the other five people that are on my leader...the global</p>
      <p begin="00:42:40.070" end="00:42:43.770">...work currently...gamer tag and then...score according to</p>
      <p begin="00:42:43.770" end="00:42:48.440">...how well they play the game now that's the global leader board so if you had a</p>
      <p begin="00:42:48.440" end="00:42:52.680">really popular game obviously my...because there's only five people but if you had</p>
      <p begin="00:42:52.680" end="00:42:57.880">a real game you might have more than five people playing so you might have thousands of people</p>
      <p begin="00:42:57.880" end="00:43:03.640">on the leader board and you probably don't want to have someone page all the way through thousands of pages of game of</p>
      <p begin="00:43:03.640" end="00:43:09.120">...find there so there's a couple of the methods you can do here we can call dot get leader board for social group</p>
      <p begin="00:43:09.120" end="00:43:14.320">basing...just a leader board with just that...friends so if you want</p>
      <p begin="00:43:14.320" end="00:43:18.570">to show them how they're competing against their friends you show them that...there's also a get leader</p>
      <p begin="00:43:18.570" end="00:43:23.010">board with skip to user so I can say well if I'm in seven hundred</p>
      <p begin="00:43:23.010" end="00:43:27.910">place only show me from seven hundred and that way you can immediately just jump to that</p>
      <p begin="00:43:27.910" end="00:43:31.440">screen show where they where they rank against the rest of the world without them having to go</p>
      <p begin="00:43:31.440" end="00:43:37.760">find out where they live in the full list of global leader boards...rewards</p>
      <p begin="00:43:37.760" end="00:43:42.600">pull that back very easy for achievements we want to pullback list of achievements that are associated with our game it's</p>
      <p begin="00:43:42.600" end="00:43:47.320">more information about them so as before use that same context object we're going to call the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:47.320" end="00:43:51.670">...server this time protocol get achievements for title id</p>
      <p begin="00:43:51.670" end="00:43:56.410">...pass in the user that we want to get the achievements for guys'll tell us if we pass in the user</p>
      <p begin="00:43:56.410" end="00:44:02.060">...we can determine if...unlocked the achievement or not pullback all types of achievement so achievements</p>
      <p begin="00:44:02.060" end="00:44:06.560">in challenges order them default and returned just a maximum</p>
      <p begin="00:44:06.560" end="00:44:10.490">ten for right now...give you an achievements result which contains</p>
      <p begin="00:44:10.490" end="00:44:15.320">an items collection inside items collection our list...equals items is</p>
      <p begin="00:44:15.320" end="00:44:19.020">an achievement so we're going to pull the name description</p>
      <p begin="00:44:19.020" end="00:44:23.980">the rewards data which this is currently sell to be a gamer point reward so this is the number</p>
      <p begin="00:44:23.980" end="00:44:28.930">of points associated with that achievement whether out it's been achieved and then as with the gamer</p>
      <p begin="00:44:28.930" end="00:44:33.740">pick you'll get a...that maps to that achievement image and if you guys play on xbox one, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:33.740" end="00:44:38.040">the achievements or these big high res...twenty by ten eighty...you can</p>
      <p begin="00:44:38.040" end="00:44:43.020">...backgrounds in your dashboards either really high res quality images so we just pull those</p>
      <p begin="00:44:43.020" end="00:44:50.470">things back and now we can draw that inside of our game and get a nice integrated experience.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:50.470" end="00:44:52.790">So, I'll jump down to achievements</p>
      <p begin="00:44:52.790" end="00:44:57.610">...web so this game has five achievements here so this again this was the name of this line</p>
      <p begin="00:44:57.610" end="00:45:01.460">this is the description...the score the image in the background is the</p>
      <p begin="00:45:01.460" end="00:45:06.280">image associated with the achievement so really each one of these things was, you know, justyou know,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:06.280" end="00:45:13.910">a single line of code to retrieve the data and then whatever code you want to write to formatted and...very simple.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:13.910" end="00:45:18.080">Now it it's interesting he just said a riots one single-line code to a</p>
      <p begin="00:45:18.080" end="00:45:22.890">...data and then and I assure you that displaying the data as a few more and your a</p>
      <p begin="00:45:22.890" end="00:45:27.520">...more lines of code is definitely more than one so, one of the things that's really cool it's</p>
      <p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:31.740">brand new that we're doing for...is we're adding this new feature to the xbox live is the</p>
      <p begin="00:45:31.740" end="00:45:36.650">...call title cobble us and what this is kind of a standardize work for</p>
      <p begin="00:45:36.650" end="00:45:41.130">certain things you do over and over your game in some cases having consistency on</p>
      <p begin="00:45:41.130" end="00:45:45.990">how many games do it is valuable so, we're given you some of this title call-you</p>
      <p begin="00:45:45.990" end="00:45:50.180">...such that you can actually in just a few lines of code much less than you would</p>
      <p begin="00:45:50.180" end="00:45:54.840">...you'd...everything from scratch from scratch you can actually call specific workload, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:54.840" end="00:45:59.340">right here live profile card whenever you need to show somebody's profile we give you a</p>
      <p begin="00:45:59.340" end="00:46:03.840">...that you can actually use...consistent all users will be familiar with it because in my</p>
      <p begin="00:46:03.840" end="00:46:07.490">...other games so it's a good way for you to very quickly get some,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:07.490" end="00:46:12.330">you know, profile...app and roddy without having to have a custom experience...you that's the way you want to go</p>
      <p begin="00:46:13.900" end="00:46:18.610">one that I see a lot is multi-player in by these workflows actually kind of hard invited multiple</p>
      <p begin="00:46:18.610" end="00:46:23.530">players, you know,...them and making sure that you can click on the right sequence</p>
      <p begin="00:46:23.530" end="00:46:25.950">...buttons et-cetera that's actually hard so,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:25.950" end="00:46:30.360">by as given you the flow already implemented you just...in...if you lines of code</p>
      <p begin="00:46:30.360" end="00:46:35.260">you're done right and the same thing we do it achievements so you get the best of both worlds</p>
      <p begin="00:46:35.260" end="00:46:40.060">on one bryan show you one line of code you get all the data you have full control over how you</p>
      <p begin="00:46:40.060" end="00:46:42.530">render it you can create these really immersive...</p>
      <p begin="00:46:42.530" end="00:46:47.420">experience we love those and on the other one you can say hey I don't think I need</p>
      <p begin="00:46:47.420" end="00:46:51.580">that...this is just a profile card I can go with the standard...that users will be familiar</p>
      <p begin="00:46:51.580" end="00:46:57.050">with few lines of code and you get the best of both worlds because you didn't have to write a lot of that code so,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:57.050" end="00:47:00.950">that's what we have we...us now the x was obviously</p>
      <p begin="00:47:00.950" end="00:47:06.110">k today you've seen it it's easy enough I'm sure you're wondering okay how do I get first of</p>

      <p begin="00:47:21.430" end="00:47:25.820">available to everybody in the platform over time but this is something we haven't done in the past</p>
      <p begin="00:47:25.820" end="00:47:30.350">...kind of going to follow I stage roll-out model we want-to make sure people succeed we</p>

      <p begin="01:01:31.040" end="01:01:35.300">...to rewrite and then we look at armor said we can get that with six weeks</p>
      <p begin="01:01:35.300" end="01:01:39.050">...was...some of them was...the code...testing because that the</p>
      <p begin="01:01:39.050" end="01:01:43.330">...weeks included are testing so it definitely makes things easier but it's not something</p>

      <p begin="01:01:48.270" end="01:01:51.680">...of course so, that's kind of where we're at and,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:51.680" end="01:01:56.800">again, feel free to come...some root questions tomorrow otherwise I'm going to be board?</p>
      <p begin="01:01:56.800" end="01:01:57.840">Right there so.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:58.870" end="01:02:01.040">Anything else.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:01.040" end="01:02:04.060">Again, the one take...go ahead as your question I'm</p>
      <p begin="01:02:04.060" end="01:02:09.590">into universe lapse if I built a gainful xbox one-on-one really high detail textures</p>
      <p begin="01:02:09.590" end="01:02:14.050">...big measures...the windows phone will be smaller this the</p>
      <p begin="01:02:14.050" end="01:02:18.460">...get all the extra use resources at the xone gets...so look at</p>
      <p begin="01:02:18.460" end="01:02:22.670">the taxes well...will be intelligent packaging involved so that's a</p>
      <p begin="01:02:22.670" end="01:02:28.480">great question so it's kind of I hey I can write against once now what about...now my...this</p>
      <p begin="01:02:28.480" end="01:02:33.190">...game going to be twenty-five gigabytes and the...no the way you have control over how you packets</p>
      <p begin="01:02:33.190" end="01:02:39.070">you assets our actual are packaging model this is word...session and,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:39.070" end="01:02:44.130">...session tomorrow...packaging will give you some advise but for the last few years we already have been able</p>
      <p begin="01:02:44.130" end="01:02:49.280">to segregate packages based on languages based on feature levels and direct text so,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:49.280" end="01:02:54.420">you can actually go back and say here's my asses for directives feature level...which</p>
      <p begin="01:02:54.420" end="01:02:59.440">will be what goes on the phone and then you can go back and said here's my assets for direct feature level, you know,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:59.440" end="01:03:04.230">twelve or, you know, feature level eleven and, you'll be able to segregate those and then</p>
      <p begin="01:03:04.230" end="01:03:08.790">our platform there's a really great java optimizing the download so we download only</p>
      <p begin="01:03:08.790" end="01:03:13.180">which needed and we make sure we even share course libraries and we do a few other things there so</p>
      <p begin="01:03:13.180" end="01:03:18.110">...salami and he session is going to talk a little bit about it and then if you want to dive deeper than</p>

      <p begin="01:03:23.370" end="01:03:28.860">and make sure that we...and there's a lot of control...you can so as long as you're willing to optimize there's a</p>
      <p begin="01:03:28.860" end="01:03:33.720">lot of control there to make sure that things are not downloaded twice...share like if you have five</p>
      <p begin="01:03:33.720" end="01:03:39.780">...on your windows a new in this tablet we actually make sure we download everything once and then the other users</p>
      <p begin="01:03:39.780" end="01:03:43.650">are sharing so that we don't...don't matter everything twice...so we do really great</p>
      <p begin="01:03:43.650" end="01:03:51.870">job optimizing that that's one thing that we're very proud of and, again, jason is a great reference for that?</p>
