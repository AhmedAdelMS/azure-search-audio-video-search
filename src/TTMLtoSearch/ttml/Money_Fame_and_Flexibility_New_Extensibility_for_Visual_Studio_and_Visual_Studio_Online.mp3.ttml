      <p begin="00:00:59.020" end="00:01:03.950">people contributing to visual so-you accessibility we're all going to be talking to you about how to create extensions for</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.950" end="00:01:10.900">real studio and for visual studio line so we got started.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.900" end="00:01:17.470">Also mandatory slide about apparently evaluations a I hear that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.470" end="00:01:22.210">the higher the score that you put...evaluation the...your chances of winning a</p>

      <p begin="00:01:26.860" end="00:01:33.120">All right so we'll just the do very quickly why work and extensibility and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.120" end="00:01:38.510">just I want to set the stage for...one understand how many of you are existing</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.510" end="00:01:43.210">visual studio extensibility developers currently have an extension create...as</p>
      <p begin="00:01:43.210" end="00:01:49.510">a handful so maybe like ten percent of audio sorry well that's good how many of you are interested?</p>

      <p begin="00:01:51.370" end="00:01:57.360">...visual see online anybody dabbling with visual studio...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:03.580">All...expected great anybody already creating extensions diversity...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.580" end="00:02:05.740">...all right you guys are</p>
      <p begin="00:02:05.740" end="00:02:10.110">winners ok so I'll talk a little bit about</p>
      <p begin="00:02:10.110" end="00:02:12.790">...why extensions this session is not</p>
      <p begin="00:02:12.790" end="00:02:16.730">a three hundred four hundred level you're ready and extension developer I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.730" end="00:02:21.200">teach about all the new api eyes and, you know, go through, through them one by one this is really</p>
      <p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:25.560">intended for the majority of the audience here which is I'm interested in visual see extensibility want to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.560" end="00:02:30.530">...more about it as...talk to-you about accessibility why do it what you can do with it</p>
      <p begin="00:02:30.530" end="00:02:34.750">we'll talk about...visual studio aspect and the visual studio line aspect for those of</p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.750" end="00:02:39.720">...ready extension developers we're going to be talking about some of the new stuff on visual</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.720" end="00:02:44.830">studio...and what you can do as a current visual studio accessibility developer on visual</p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.830" end="00:02:48.500">...but it's mostly targeted ad if you're interested in the topic</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.500" end="00:02:53.120">you want to know more about it so that's kind of the level that we're going to be apps just to set expectations if you're looking at the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.120" end="00:02:57.450">re-re deep level api stuff we actually recorded some sessions</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.450" end="00:03:02.160">on video so that you...refer to them at the end of the talk and you can go and watch a</p>
      <p begin="00:03:02.160" end="00:03:05.310">...talk more about the nitty-gritty of api...and how to do things</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.310" end="00:03:11.520">right so we'll talk a bit about the high-level of what is possible then we'll go</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.520" end="00:03:15.700">...two sections one is going to be about the visual studio client and how</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.700" end="00:03:19.710">we can extend that...is going to be about visual studio line...how you can extend that...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:19.710" end="00:03:24.690">all-star quickly with what is an extension so extensions are basically ways to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.690" end="00:03:30.050">customize are developing environment as developers we like to control how're environment</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.050" end="00:03:34.910">works we spend a lot of time in our environment and,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.910" end="00:03:39.730">you know, everything from the colors the to the keyboard</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.730" end="00:03:40.910">shortcuts</p>
      <p begin="00:03:40.910" end="00:03:45.690">...certain behaviors of how things do we like to customize all of those things extensions</p>
      <p begin="00:03:45.690" end="00:03:50.340">provide you with a way to do these customizations for yourself but also allow</p>
      <p begin="00:03:50.340" end="00:03:55.170">you to give those customizations to people and you can go all the way from like doing the simple things of adding,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:55.170" end="00:04:00.190">you know, a little code snippet and giving it to everybody to use all the way</p>
      <p begin="00:04:00.190" end="00:04:05.490">to having a project system that handles java so, for example, this morning when you so</p>
      <p begin="00:04:05.490" end="00:04:10.730">...crafts that mine craft demo is all about if you noticed is about java development</p>
      <p begin="00:04:10.730" end="00:04:15.440">and...happening in visual studio but if you also realize visual studio doesn't really do javaso,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:15.440" end="00:04:17.510">how was it done well extensions and?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.530" end="00:04:23.410">Actually same right here is the one that authored a java extensions in visual studio allows you to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.410" end="00:04:28.070">edits build and debug java code from without within visual studio so we were looking</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.070" end="00:04:29.700">at creating extension for</p>
      <p begin="00:04:29.700" end="00:04:34.510">...craft instead of redoing that work we built on top of says extension to do a</p>
      <p begin="00:04:34.510" end="00:04:38.490">java so...extensions building on top of each other some nice way to not only</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.490" end="00:04:46.330">customized but also and, modify functionality in the visual studio id.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:46.330" end="00:04:51.080">The way that those extensions...get authored and then go to other</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.080" end="00:04:53.430">people's that you publish them to the visual studio gallery you</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53.430" end="00:04:56.810">can also actually handle them as deployment bits we call them</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.810" end="00:05:01.710">bsix packages we can create packages and give other people but traditional way that you would give it to somebody and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:01.710" end="00:05:06.550">make it available to a lot of people is by putting it on the visual studio gallery so as an extension author</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.550" end="00:05:11.650">we give you access to...visual study gallery upload your extension managed updates change</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.650" end="00:05:16.530">versions do all of that stuff and then you'll be able to also in the gallery see the feedback</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.530" end="00:05:21.100">...the ratings for your for your thing the feedback...this coming in from user eventually going to be able to see a</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.100" end="00:05:25.270">lot more like crash data and things like that so it's a it's kind of a rich experience targeted</p>
      <p begin="00:05:25.270" end="00:05:29.590">...but then on the consuming side every developer...you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:29.590" end="00:05:34.660">millions of developers using visual studio every developer guess access...visual...gallery and they can go and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.660" end="00:05:39.510">browse that and...extension...right and it also be able to.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:39.510" end="00:05:43.730">Tell you how good it is or what you need to improve...right?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:43.730" end="00:05:48.160">From inside visual studio there's also an experienced...extensions so there's</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:53.490">an extensions the...where you can go and view one of the most popular extensions and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.490" end="00:05:57.570">...revamping this experience...so this kind of a preliminary experience that we ship</p>
      <p begin="00:05:57.570" end="00:06:00.840">...the last release and kind of keeping up for this time around but</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.840" end="00:06:05.720">...looking at improving this experience and everybody used to be the only</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.720" end="00:06:06.890">...professional visual</p>
      <p begin="00:06:06.890" end="00:06:11.010">studio enterprise that would be able to get access to those extensions</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.010" end="00:06:16.290">...with about six months ago I think we're...visual studio community</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.290" end="00:06:21.510">and visually community is open to is a free version is also open to be using</p>
      <p begin="00:06:21.510" end="00:06:24.360">...extensions so now...people if</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24.360" end="00:06:28.750">you're creating extensions every single visual to developer almost every single visual</p>
      <p begin="00:06:28.750" end="00:06:31.390">...developer has access has the ability to access</p>
      <p begin="00:06:31.390" end="00:06:36.300">...extensions it's a much wider audience than we've ever had before so,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.300" end="00:06:40.030">we're glad to have that...it's a great-great way of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:40.030" end="00:06:43.660">a larger ecosystem and making all the customizations all...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:43.660" end="00:06:48.480">modifications that you're doing available to every single visual...developer right so now</p>
      <p begin="00:06:48.480" end="00:06:55.650">visually community has that support and for visual twenty fifteen obviously we're continuing with that?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:55.650" end="00:06:59.860">In addition to the visual studio traditional visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:06:59.860" end="00:07:03.750">extensibility which is...allowed us to give that</p>
      <p begin="00:07:03.750" end="00:07:08.090">...additional features and now we have is to the online and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:08.090" end="00:07:12.560">visually align is basically the targeted at teams working together so</p>
      <p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:16.080">way to collaborate over codes and collaborate overwork</p>
      <p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:20.660">in general and,we're now enabling you to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:20.660" end="00:07:25.750">have extensibility not only in visual studio client but also on visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:07:25.750" end="00:07:30.790">line itself and are many scenarios and that kind of spend both the work</p>
      <p begin="00:07:30.790" end="00:07:35.390">for you individually as a developer working on your machine eight hours a day doing</p>
      <p begin="00:07:35.390" end="00:07:40.350">something but also we have a component where as a team you want to see something, you know, whether it's a</p>
      <p begin="00:07:40.350" end="00:07:44.960">code review tool where you want to see some changes</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:49.720">on the developer client and be able to see something on a team room or whether it is</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.720" end="00:07:54.680">a some analysis that is happening on a continuous integration you wanna-be able to see those results individuals</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.680" end="00:07:59.820">to id even learned lots of scenarios where you're going to see both of them happening together so,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:59.820" end="00:08:02.600">for example, this is just a snapshot of my own visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02.600" end="00:08:07.340">...page where I can get to create repositories and projects and share them with</p>
      <p begin="00:08:07.340" end="00:08:14.660">other people and collaborate on them so you can actually customize...experience and...going to talk about that more detail?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:14.660" end="00:08:19.520">basically it's a obviously online covers everything from the code itself and how it works</p>
      <p begin="00:08:19.520" end="00:08:23.880">in the build...the build management configuration of that all the way to the testing of its</p>
      <p begin="00:08:23.880" end="00:08:28.760">and deployment of it and...having insights on it to work item tracking and source code</p>
      <p begin="00:08:28.760" end="00:08:33.530">management...basically a full experience...the lifecycle of your application so we allow you to</p>
      <p begin="00:08:33.530" end="00:08:38.300">customize every single part of that that's our goal right so today we're going to tell you about how to do</p>
      <p begin="00:08:38.300" end="00:08:41.340">this but why do...be questions why do the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:41.340" end="00:08:45.520">...a bunch of motivated people coming here I'm glad that, you know, all of you raise your hand</p>
      <p begin="00:08:45.520" end="00:08:50.390">...said who is interested in doing it that's great...many reasons why people are interested in doing this</p>
      <p begin="00:08:50.390" end="00:08:54.940">number one reason is actually for you and for your team like when we</p>
      <p begin="00:08:54.940" end="00:08:59.130">talk to developers why did you start customizing visual studio first thing they say is</p>
      <p begin="00:08:59.130" end="00:09:04.490">there was something I wanted to do I could into in visual studio I asked you guys didn't do it so I</p>
      <p begin="00:09:04.490" end="00:09:06.080">...myself?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:11.440">And,...we ask people to tell us what they...we have user voice and we go ask people to vote</p>
      <p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:16.440">and things and user voice and some things you just you can see it but you don't necessarily everybody</p>
      <p begin="00:09:16.440" end="00:09:20.430">lcs it just doesn't...are radar so you go to it and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:20.430" end="00:09:25.180">what by,... get that, you know, giving you that ability you get to creates</p>
      <p begin="00:09:25.180" end="00:09:30.330">the demand and that need and then you help all...developers so this was a from a blog post comment</p>
      <p begin="00:09:30.330" end="00:09:35.990">...a blog post from just a few weeks ago this person right there was saying</p>
      <p begin="00:09:35.990" end="00:09:42.540">hey feature requests I would love it if you guys do this now think...from our</p>
      <p begin="00:09:42.540" end="00:09:48.570">rc just shipped you guys couple days ago and we made it available to our</p>
      <p begin="00:09:48.570" end="00:09:53.560">...vp maybe just a little while shorter than that so two weeks ago we were about ready to finish the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.560" end="00:09:58.340">last finishing touches on that product and but it out the market here's somebody coming us with</p>
      <p begin="00:09:58.340" end="00:10:00.410">a feature requests...be really nice visual</p>
      <p begin="00:10:00.410" end="00:10:05.730">...fifteen had that there's no way in the next two days we're going to be able to look at this and make</p>
      <p begin="00:10:05.730" end="00:10:08.710">it happen butts with visual to the extensibility</p>
      <p begin="00:10:08.710" end="00:10:13.660">...absolutely make that what is being requested hear something that is open easy to do</p>
      <p begin="00:10:13.660" end="00:10:19.240">as a visual studio extension somebody could just do that and then, you know, letting go from there?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.240" end="00:10:24.700">Another reason is ...you have a certain you already have a product that you that is</p>
      <p begin="00:10:24.700" end="00:10:29.390">...a developers or you have you want to create a product that started...developers visual</p>
      <p begin="00:10:29.390" end="00:10:34.310">studio has millions of people that would be able to see it so that's one way to get your idea your</p>
      <p begin="00:10:34.310" end="00:10:41.390">...out to a lot of people to see money and...fame</p>
      <p begin="00:10:41.390" end="00:10:47.850">...so how do you how do you get all that audience and</p>
      <p begin="00:10:47.850" end="00:10:52.800">the one of the things that you can do extensions are not fully free there are paid extensions well they're actually a number of companies</p>
      <p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:57.770">...them I can see here...audience or making the money off of a</p>
      <p begin="00:10:57.770" end="00:11:05.200">extensions to visual studio and, it's a thriving ecosystem is something that you can play...as well?</p>
      <p begin="00:11:05.200" end="00:11:11.400">If you go in the third-floor you...to find a...for visual studio industry partners and</p>
      <p begin="00:11:11.400" end="00:11:13.910">they're all people that are actually participating in our</p>
      <p begin="00:11:13.910" end="00:11:18.730">...system and...are great set of people to not only go learn about what is it that</p>
      <p begin="00:11:18.730" end="00:11:22.670">they're doing that could help use developer they're set of people to also talk to about what their</p>
      <p begin="00:11:22.670" end="00:11:25.720">experience is building visual studio accessibility solutions and they</p>
      <p begin="00:11:25.720" end="00:11:30.910">would be very happy to talk to-you about not only their solution but also what it took them to</p>
      <p begin="00:11:30.910" end="00:11:37.830">creating the afterall all developers...real to help each other so, that's something to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:37.830" end="00:11:41.700">Last is.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:41.700" end="00:11:44.700">Creating you know, that sense of...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:45.810" end="00:11:51.000">Think of it as a like that's one thing that we're starting to do now is you creating your learning</p>
      <p begin="00:11:51.000" end="00:11:53.130">...you skill and one of the best ways to learn</p>
      <p begin="00:11:53.130" end="00:11:57.270">...new skill is to learn it with other developers and</p>
      <p begin="00:11:57.270" end="00:12:01.200">...one of the things that we're pushing for right now is a for a lot of things to be</p>
      <p begin="00:12:01.200" end="00:12:05.530">open-source and you've seen you know, you know throughout the key notes yesterday</p>
      <p begin="00:12:05.530" end="00:12:10.320">and today of a lot of stuff being pushed online to get harbour to some other open-source</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:15.710">repository and the this is one great way of learning...scale so you want to learn about</p>
      <p begin="00:12:15.710" end="00:12:19.690">...extensibility want to see how it's done...creating open-source project</p>
      <p begin="00:12:19.690" end="00:12:24.420">go started and go have people collaborate on it and the fun thing is when we actually started looking at the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:24.420" end="00:12:29.030">statistics for visual studio extensions a lot of them are actually being</p>
      <p begin="00:12:29.030" end="00:12:33.780">...open-source quite a number of fact the top twenty about fifty percent is already</p>
      <p begin="00:12:33.780" end="00:12:38.440">open-source available to you that you can go learn from contribute to whatever it is that you want so</p>
      <p begin="00:12:38.440" end="00:12:41.590">that's another thing that is that...enjoyable as a developer</p>
      <p begin="00:12:41.590" end="00:12:47.830">...to belong to communities that...a nice and healthy thriving community that you can be part.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:47.830" end="00:12:51.480">This is actually a cool extension I was browsing the community stuff and the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:51.480" end="00:12:56.310">accession that I saw was this one is called the encourage</p>
      <p begin="00:12:56.310" end="00:12:59.500">visual studio and the sole purpose in life is when you save.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:00.580" end="00:13:02.150">It gives you...message</p>
      <p begin="00:13:02.150" end="00:13:07.110">...you job...something you need that smiling your day, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:07.110" end="00:13:11.830">after working hard and something for somebody the baggio the backs of this was apache...was created by a</p>
      <p begin="00:13:11.830" end="00:13:16.930">...hacker actually works...get up and the fun extension I thought it was really cool</p>
      <p begin="00:13:16.930" end="00:13:21.080">he actually open-source that extension or his number one request was can-you customize</p>
      <p begin="00:13:21.080" end="00:13:26.030">the messages that are being there so he added tools options extensibility people have them do that and now</p>
      <p begin="00:13:26.030" end="00:13:31.520">you could actually some read like if you don't like the encouraging messages anyone to you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:31.520" end="00:13:36.350">some other types of encouragement you've got that too so lots of cool things that you can actually build with</p>
      <p begin="00:13:36.350" end="00:13:39.920">a...until them if I show it here that, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:39.920" end="00:13:46.290">everybody's going to go download it's called visit encourage, encourage you to downloaded very...</p>
      <p begin="00:13:46.290" end="00:13:51.590">All right so that's enough...encouragement abouts the visual city</p>
      <p begin="00:13:51.590" end="00:13:56.920">extensibility what I really wanted to get today is actually and how to do that what</p>
      <p begin="00:13:56.920" end="00:14:02.350">is possible in the world of visual studio extensibility so I'm going to start by introducing sam</p>
      <p begin="00:14:02.350" end="00:14:08.410">...sam is a lead engineer at the synopsis working on</p>
      <p begin="00:14:08.410" end="00:14:11.490">...also has a lot of extensions ffour visual</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.490" end="00:14:16.590">studio of java is one of them of course but he's got a lot more he's going to talk to-you</p>
      <p begin="00:14:16.590" end="00:14:21.920">about some of them he's a very experience developer obviously sensibilities I thought,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:26.790">you know, the me talking about it actually get somebody from our community talk to-you about it and...telly how...goes</p>
      <p begin="00:14:26.790" end="00:14:33.330">...take away from...thank you dirk?</p>
      <p begin="00:14:33.330" end="00:14:37.880">Sorrows give-me-a-call on april...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:37.880" end="00:14:41.290">And, they said we're going to put the...craft.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:41.290" end="00:14:42.780">Demo in our keynote.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:43.930" end="00:14:48.860">And, we're going to put you in a session right after it and, we're going to give</p>
      <p begin="00:14:48.860" end="00:14:58.570">you twenty minutes and we want you to explain how it works.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:58.570" end="00:14:59.920">There's two groups of people in</p>
      <p begin="00:14:59.920" end="00:15:02.930">here there are people that know it is impossible.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:04.330" end="00:15:13.160">Because you're already in extension developer and the rest of you literally don't care.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:13.160" end="00:15:15.430">So, you'll be happy...here that</p>
      <p begin="00:15:15.430" end="00:15:19.980">...said no I would love to come onstage I love doing extensions but,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:19.980" end="00:15:26.670">you know,...this is a group that came to learn we're going to give them some practical information and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:26.670" end="00:15:29.330">show that visual studio extensions.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:31.030" end="00:15:36.570">Means something for them in their job.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:36.570" end="00:15:39.070">So, I...turned around.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:40.130" end="00:15:42.600">The demo that you see today.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:42.600" end="00:15:47.960">I thought of while I was driving to the airport to come here.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:47.960" end="00:15:53.570">I developed it on a nonstop flight from boston to san francisco.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:53.570" end="00:15:58.920">And, took a two-and-a-half-hour nap.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:58.920" end="00:16:02.540">And, you're actually going to want to results.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:02.540" end="00:16:16.340">Bold statement I'm hoping that lives up.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:16.340" end="00:16:21.360">So, I actually do get this question a lot there's a lot of people that say I get this question is made up now people</p>
      <p begin="00:16:21.360" end="00:16:26.070">really do wonder what can you extend you can literally extend anything.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:26.070" end="00:16:30.350">...demo...software mine...yes I made it I did not make it for</p>
      <p begin="00:16:30.350" end="00:16:33.040">...I was doing research in java</p>
      <p begin="00:16:35.190" end="00:16:38.500">...static analysis software at college and,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:38.500" end="00:16:44.840">I didn't like anything but visual studio team and they said hey that looks good for my craft</p>
      <p begin="00:16:44.840" end="00:16:51.870">so yes you can do pretty much anything on a simple scale you can create a new command.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:51.870" end="00:16:54.120">You can added tool window both of</p>
      <p begin="00:16:54.120" end="00:17:03.420">these are very common things that actually a pretty easy to do now adding a debug are visualize or.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:03.420" end="00:17:05.850">If you have a particular data type that you want to show</p>
      <p begin="00:17:05.850" end="00:17:12.490">in a different way I've done some really cool things here I had a data type that what was a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:12.490" end="00:17:15.080">block of tax that was.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.080" end="00:17:19.960">Xml and it was hard-to-read and emait certainly couldn't read in the tool tip I wrote a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:19.960" end="00:17:24.580">debug are...that could take this xml format and put into an html</p>
      <p begin="00:17:24.580" end="00:17:28.830">format was suitable for display in debugging so I could quickly get an</p>
      <p begin="00:17:28.830" end="00:17:36.120">overview of the contents of this data structure and plugged in that's easy.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:36.120" end="00:17:39.160">That html visualize are all I had to do was</p>
      <p begin="00:17:39.160" end="00:17:42.290">...html...html string.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:42.290" end="00:17:46.300">Inside the class so I happen to know what the visualize or was it was a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:46.300" end="00:17:52.470">targeted case and now I was able to debug this type much easier.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:52.470" end="00:18:00.460">You can add a refactoring option this used to be possible but difficult.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:00.460" end="00:18:04.220">With roslyn in early cp is a visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:18:04.220" end="00:18:09.130">twenty fifteen which has since been improved I did six of them in one</p>
      <p begin="00:18:09.130" end="00:18:10.300">day for</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.300" end="00:18:15.270">targeted business requirements that are only relevant to the team that I was working on at the time.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:15.270" end="00:18:16.690">Manual things that I did</p>
      <p begin="00:18:16.690" end="00:18:22.500">during code review anyone could verify automatically at that point.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:22.500" end="00:18:25.060">These are going to be meaningfulyou might not</p>
      <p begin="00:18:25.060" end="00:18:28.600">use them today a year from now this is going to be a standard part of your</p>
      <p begin="00:18:28.600" end="00:18:36.640">workflow and you will probably be using ones that nobody else is just for your project.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:36.640" end="00:18:41.760">I've been pushing back so, I don't work for microsoft word for...verity I do I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:18:41.760" end="00:18:44.940">a lead on the desktop experience.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:46.060" end="00:18:51.050">I make sure...expert their extensions work well for your environment I've</p>
      <p begin="00:18:51.050" end="00:18:55.490">been pushing back on microsoft regarding the whole experience for extension</p>
      <p begin="00:18:55.490" end="00:19:00.640">developers for a while now and several teams have come to me</p>
      <p begin="00:19:00.640" end="00:19:07.190">and we've been working to improve your experience from the day you start to the...ship.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:07.190" end="00:19:10.340">And, some of the ways that we've done is</p>
      <p begin="00:19:10.340" end="00:19:14.180">the new practical templates not one project where you</p>
      <p begin="00:19:14.180" end="00:19:18.940">create you create some sample and it has one static set of features and if you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:18.940" end="00:19:20.490">do anything else.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:20.490" end="00:19:23.750">Well, you've got some samples there to start with good luck.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:23.750" end="00:19:26.180">No, it's actually you can start with nothing</p>
      <p begin="00:19:26.180" end="00:19:31.900">and you can add the features you want you will see that and then.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:31.900" end="00:19:37.330">You have a project...contains exactly what you intended.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:37.330" end="00:19:38.630">Open-source extensions.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:40.250" end="00:19:44.880">This used to be open-source samples one of the most valuable things about</p>
      <p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:48.770">...extension is people care about it they</p>
      <p begin="00:19:48.770" end="00:19:52.120">use it and they're going to maintain it and it's going to stay relevant.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:53.280" end="00:19:56.650">These are things that are going to solve problems you care about in ways that you</p>
      <p begin="00:19:56.650" end="00:20:04.080">probably want to look at and understand so.</p>

      <p begin="00:20:49.070" end="00:20:54.130">experience and it does not matter what version visual studio you open it in</p>
      <p begin="00:20:54.130" end="00:20:59.970">two thousand ten plus they're kind of work exactly like what I just said.</p>

      <p begin="00:21:18.590" end="00:21:24.680">extension I didn't come up with the idea my name is maybe in a footnote.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:24.680" end="00:21:31.130">But, I enjoyed having a role in making sure it was polish for everybody to use.</p>

      <p begin="00:26:29.830" end="00:26:31.440">So, what I'm going to start</p>
      <p begin="00:26:31.440" end="00:26:35.640">...is I will go and I will?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:35.640" end="00:26:45.930">Create a new gab repository and we will call it and presentation</p>

      <p begin="00:27:18.160" end="00:27:20.470">And, I will not make it a private repository.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:22.630" end="00:27:27.800">we put it on to varies organizationwith the predefine</p>
      <p begin="00:27:27.800" end="00:27:32.270">get ignore create all right and I now have a repository.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:41.490" end="00:27:42.640">Creativeness solution.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:43.850" end="00:27:45.950">This is one of the things.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:45.950" end="00:27:49.480">They told me they made new templates for this and I was like</p>
      <p begin="00:27:49.480" end="00:27:54.460">I don't like using templates I'm one of those people that I'm not going to use word to make html documents</p>
      <p begin="00:27:54.460" end="00:28:02.270">...the output it's a little noisy for me this is a great template.</p>

      <p begin="00:29:01.260" end="00:29:06.180">needed to be added it configured...build so that it's going to package it up as a</p>
      <p begin="00:29:06.180" end="00:29:10.410">...it added my bs package for extension developers, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:10.410" end="00:29:14.360">what I'm talking about the rest if you are really happy that you don't need to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:14.360" end="00:29:18.710">do this simple as that?</p>
      <p begin="00:29:18.710" end="00:29:23.230">This is actually a really complicated process.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:23.230" end="00:29:28.760">via ct file was created it added my new extension there we're going to give it a new</p>
      <p begin="00:29:28.760" end="00:29:35.010">...actually going to say when it shows up on a menu it's going to be called increase font-size.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:35.010" end="00:29:35.650">We're going to go to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:35.650" end="00:29:53.700">the tvs package and I'm going to use another extensibility feature.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:53.700" end="00:30:09.130">I was a little sleepy on this.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:09.130" end="00:30:16.480">...good thing I don't actually have to...this method right.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:16.480" end="00:30:20.730">Adjusting the font-size actually uses several of the visual studio api is that</p>
      <p begin="00:30:20.730" end="00:30:25.640">...not specifically going to go into but it is going to be open-source...to reference this.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:25.640" end="00:30:29.530">Is a fun color storage service I basically told it get the current</p>
      <p begin="00:30:29.530" end="00:30:32.250">font increase the font-size by whatever the changes?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:33.370" end="00:30:38.290">Or decreases and...apply it to specific categories</p>
      <p begin="00:30:38.290" end="00:30:42.080">all right now I go over to my increase font-size.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:42.080" end="00:30:46.330">It added a command...is so much easier than it used to be</p>

      <p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:31:03.220">...all right so when we execute the command all we need to do is.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:03.220" end="00:31:09.030">Increase the font-size and this is my increase command so will increase it by two points.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:09.030" end="00:31:13.790">So, basically to adjust the font-size for all those different categories in fonts and colors that you would</p>
      <p begin="00:31:13.790" end="00:31:17.860">have had to go manually to just to say you're font-size all</p>
      <p begin="00:31:17.860" end="00:31:19.390">...now one of</p>
      <p begin="00:31:19.390" end="00:31:38.140">the cool things adding a new command do the same thing for decrease and it's much faster.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:38.140" end="00:31:43.150">So, when did this it reuse the same...the same command table?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:43.150" end="00:31:46.170">And, it just created only the necessary additions in order to add</p>

      <p begin="00:32:00.280" end="00:32:04.750">The naming of the package by default is a little weird.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:04.750" end="00:32:09.590">But, that's okay all right so that's it.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:09.590" end="00:32:15.610">If...run this.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:15.610" end="00:32:21.780">If your extension developer, you know, that actually this is also something used to have to configure.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:21.780" end="00:32:23.680">Every step that I did</p>
      <p begin="00:32:23.680" end="00:32:28.660">today used to be about ten steps in the past this was literally</p>
      <p begin="00:32:28.660" end="00:32:36.290">...and impossible presentation ever before.</p>

      <p begin="00:35:50.770" end="00:35:55.180">...for this release really putting a big emphasis on extensibility we're starting with beefing</p>
      <p begin="00:35:55.180" end="00:35:59.970">up the sdk the documentation the samples presence on get hub</p>
      <p begin="00:35:59.970" end="00:36:04.910">opensource getting everything that is open-source available to so you can see it encouraging you and having</p>
      <p begin="00:36:04.910" end="00:36:09.880">away for you to creature stuff and open-source you just...get hub extension for visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:36:09.880" end="00:36:14.450">...we just-released with rc makes it easier for you to go and do that as well as</p>
      <p begin="00:36:14.450" end="00:36:19.750">so the gallery or...gallery subtle number of things that we're doingfor making</p>
      <p begin="00:36:19.750" end="00:36:23.740">...better in visual studio twenty fifteen so it's really a very good time to be</p>
      <p begin="00:36:23.740" end="00:36:28.620">an extension developer in visual studio so that was focused on the...to declined the new thing</p>
      <p begin="00:36:28.620" end="00:36:33.540">that we're also adding is now with visual studio online or enabling new ways of extensibility</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.540" end="00:36:38.580">for the visual city community and here ...going to talk to-you about how to do that but</p>
      <p begin="00:36:39.750" end="00:36:44.320">...also a tethered actually with a cable to this thing I'm serious</p>
      <p begin="00:36:44.320" end="00:36:48.210">...is the cable so he can't move...is just sagan there,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:48.210" end="00:36:48.930">you know, why?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:50.440" end="00:36:56.510">Okay,...back...</p>
      <p begin="00:36:56.510" end="00:37:00.320">Okay, so, I'm going to go through a few slides pretty quickly I do essays</p>
      <p begin="00:37:00.320" end="00:37:05.750">in the new cool stuff that we're doing on...so side for extensibility we've</p>
      <p begin="00:37:05.750" end="00:37:10.280">sort of announced stuff, you know, the last couple of days related to so,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:10.280" end="00:37:14.650">this...extensions for via so we've already had some any</p>
      <p begin="00:37:14.650" end="00:37:17.410">...and...actually star building some stuff and</p>
      <p begin="00:37:17.410" end="00:37:22.720">...initially...some examples of that we're pretty excited about this because it brings a lot of the same</p>
      <p begin="00:37:22.720" end="00:37:27.120">sort of concepts and ideas that you have in ds clients today for building extensions and kind</p>
      <p begin="00:37:27.120" end="00:37:30.810">of extending your development environment and brings that same kind</p>
      <p begin="00:37:30.810" end="00:37:36.330">of concept india so...fs as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:36.330" end="00:37:38.530">Okay, so,you just in a high level,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:38.530" end="00:37:41.920">you know,...we think about you know-how people are building software today</p>
      <p begin="00:37:41.920" end="00:37:46.640">it's deliver software really requires a lot of different tools for a lot of different chains,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:50.670">you know, if we...teams we talked to a small team to talk to organizations</p>
      <p begin="00:37:51.770" end="00:37:56.120">...pretty common...is that they're not just using one stack of tools</p>
      <p begin="00:37:56.120" end="00:37:59.290">their nudges using tf asses this sort of back into manage all</p>
      <p begin="00:37:59.290" end="00:38:04.170">...different development projects using different tools...have a team its using...sort</p>
      <p begin="00:38:04.170" end="00:38:10.060">of lightweight management of the tasks and work...doing your...if they...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:10.060" end="00:38:13.800">applications in builders job applications using things like...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:17.960">Tools...user voice forgetting user feedback and...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:18.970" end="00:38:21.640">Tools for collaboration like slack.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:21.640" end="00:38:28.020">...people to their using a lot of different tools as a delivering software.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:28.020" end="00:38:32.870">We want-to make sure that if you're using visual studio online or using...fast they you</p>
      <p begin="00:38:32.870" end="00:38:37.270">can weave together all these tools...create your own sort-of perfect development</p>
      <p begin="00:38:37.270" end="00:38:41.730">environment so again just like in visual studio client where you can kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:38:41.730" end="00:38:46.240">...different extensions in the...buy something for a partner you just get...from</p>
      <p begin="00:38:46.240" end="00:38:51.880">the from the gallery from open-source we want to enable that same type of ecosystem that</p>
      <p begin="00:38:51.880" end="00:38:58.960">same kind of customization visual studio online as well as...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:58.960" end="00:39:02.880">So, we don't want to stuff over the last year sort of on the integration</p>
      <p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:08.820">side because really when it comes down to it all this...just talked about customization</p>
      <p begin="00:39:08.820" end="00:39:12.490">...sort of a perfect development environment starts with the ability for</p>
      <p begin="00:39:12.490" end="00:39:15.120">...integrate with our services so</p>
      <p begin="00:39:15.120" end="00:39:18.960">...actually programmatic the integrate with via so through</p>
      <p begin="00:39:18.960" end="00:39:23.240">...through api eyes so what we lashes we announced</p>
      <p begin="00:39:23.240" end="00:39:27.670">...delimited bunch of rest api is there's a whole bunch of rest api for interacting</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.670" end="00:39:32.170">now of esl aps forgetting your work items and builds and that kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:39:32.170" end="00:39:38.870">stuff we also introduce something called service irks which is basically a way to kinda</p>
      <p begin="00:39:38.870" end="00:39:44.010">send messages between services so...you do something india so like checking code you can have</p>
      <p begin="00:39:44.010" end="00:39:50.340">a send a message off to another service...the kick-off some of the workflow?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:50.340" end="00:39:54.280">...sort of extension of that no pun intended really is to</p>
      <p begin="00:39:54.280" end="00:39:59.110">start really delivering and allowing you to build even deeper</p>
      <p begin="00:39:59.110" end="00:40:04.040">more richer experiences integration experiences with india so in dvs.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:04.040" end="00:40:04.340">So, this</p>
      <p begin="00:40:04.340" end="00:40:09.360">step and you can do up until now was I would say pretty basic you can build some nice</p>
      <p begin="00:40:09.360" end="00:40:14.510">...of services service integrations the...ions through service sucks the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:14.510" end="00:40:18.000">...announcing at build for building extensions is really going to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:18.000" end="00:40:21.580">enable you to build much deeper richer integrations</p>
      <p begin="00:40:21.580" end="00:40:25.690">so integrations where instead of users flipping between four or five</p>
      <p begin="00:40:25.690" end="00:40:30.470">different browsers for five different services to get the information they need.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:30.470" end="00:40:33.090">It's all brian together it's, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:33.090" end="00:40:35.740">available...context so if I'm looking</p>
      <p begin="00:40:35.740" end="00:40:39.730">...they don't have to flip over to another windowed to go look at another services</p>
      <p begin="00:40:39.730" end="00:40:49.460">build information I can see that build information...my idea so experience.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:49.460" end="00:40:54.840">So, I mention most...this already...a skip it for now is four-time we</p>
      <p begin="00:40:54.840" end="00:40:59.510">have delivered a bunch of...api as we continue to deliver rest api is.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:59.510" end="00:41:03.320">The one really important point to make here is that all the rest</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03.320" end="00:41:08.230">...developed and delivered so far...been exclusively esl.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:08.230" end="00:41:12.650">But,...with the rc...twenty fifteen rc all those api</p>
      <p begin="00:41:12.650" end="00:41:16.140">is are available in dvs on prime as well</p>
      <p begin="00:41:16.140" end="00:41:23.050">...the same api set between via so in pdfs.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:23.050" end="00:41:27.440">Service folksI'm actually show you a quick example of this.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:29.370">...I...tenuous.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:29.370" end="00:41:32.360">Service...is something that we added lashing that's also coming</p>
      <p begin="00:41:32.360" end="00:41:35.200">...fs twenty fifteen as well and,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:35.200" end="00:41:39.230">it's going to be what kind of enables very quick integration between</p>
      <p begin="00:41:39.230" end="00:41:43.880">...and other services that whenever you check</p>
      <p begin="00:41:43.880" end="00:41:46.150">...build gets completed you can have</p>
      <p begin="00:41:46.150" end="00:41:50.170">...drives some other action or some other sort of process</p>
      <p begin="00:41:50.170" end="00:41:51.990">on another service.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:51.990" end="00:42:07.070">...quick demo of this you can kinda get better sense of service irks switch here.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:07.070" end="00:42:08.300">Zooming okay,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:09.480" end="00:42:14.230">so, how many people use or know of slack?</p>
      <p begin="00:42:14.230" end="00:42:18.970">Sl ack okay quite a few so we work with slack in the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:18.970" end="00:42:24.410">lashing to build...direct integration between via and slack.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:24.410" end="00:42:28.740">And, this is another thing that will be nt...twenty fifteen rc as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:28.740" end="00:42:33.290">So, when I can do with the integration using service circuses I can say hey let's say I</p>
      <p begin="00:42:33.290" end="00:42:37.820">have a channel here and I make sure to go to an empty channel where no other people who are at posit</p>
      <p begin="00:42:37.820" end="00:42:43.010">...densely before and when I can do and...I can say for this galego</p>
      <p begin="00:42:43.010" end="00:42:47.260">...integration I want to be able to say that?</p>
      <p begin="00:42:47.260" end="00:42:52.430">...here slide visual studio aligns by integration.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:52.430" end="00:42:58.340">...it's going to do is it's going to give me a url here semantic a channel.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:58.340" end="00:43:07.530">Give-me url...I just need to go plug into the sl.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:07.530" end="00:43:11.290">So, what I can do now is I can flip over to the sl if</p>
      <p begin="00:43:11.290" end="00:43:15.610">you haven't seen this before it's pretty cool a different encourage you to try it out if</p>
      <p begin="00:43:15.610" end="00:43:20.840">you're project administrator you go into your admin?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:20.840" end="00:43:21.740">There's a new sort</p>
      <p begin="00:43:21.740" end="00:43:25.970">...service x cabin again this will be in twenty fifteen rc as well as</p>
      <p begin="00:43:25.970" end="00:43:30.220">service x tab you can basically define what we call subscriptions was just</p>
      <p begin="00:43:30.220" end="00:43:33.170">a way to say hey when something happens.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:33.170" end="00:43:36.880">Do something over here so we support of a whole bunch</p>
      <p begin="00:43:36.880" end="00:43:41.700">of services out-of-the-box this list is going to get bigger as we go?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:41.700" end="00:43:43.580">But, I can take slack.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:43.580" end="00:43:45.750">Hit next.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:45.750" end="00:43:47.850">And, I can say okay whatever, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:47.850" end="00:43:51.680">build completes code gets push...our team is this we, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:51.680" end="00:43:56.170">have a subscript says hey when code is pushed to this repo we want to know about in a</p>
      <p begin="00:43:56.170" end="00:43:58.360">are slight channel?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:58.360" end="00:44:02.740">What I'm going to do for this is an say...getting...created without any filters</p>
      <p begin="00:44:02.740" end="00:44:09.530">...want to go ahead and just post message out to that channel and slack?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:09.530" end="00:44:09.940">Okay,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:09.940" end="00:44:22.200">so,...my subscription for this project if I now flip back over here.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:22.200" end="00:44:28.910">...menu part of backlog item what should happen if everything...is I should see</p>
      <p begin="00:44:28.910" end="00:44:30.450">...message pop open in</p>
      <p begin="00:44:30.450" end="00:44:35.490">...so this is kind of a simple example you could imagine a</p>
      <p begin="00:44:35.490" end="00:44:40.320">lot more interesting sort of complex examples that you can do through service</p>
      <p begin="00:44:40.320" end="00:44:44.350">...for example, if use what I have a custom service...kind of receiving sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:44:44.350" end="00:44:49.210">a jasonkeath payload version of those events...driving some internal process</p>
      <p begin="00:44:49.210" end="00:44:54.600">you can do all that to the web hook service that we offer but for a team</p>
      <p begin="00:44:54.600" end="00:44:58.490">...using slack or using some other collaboration tool.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:58.490" end="00:45:02.510">They can get also notifications as things are happening in the projects is the team</p>
      <p begin="00:45:02.510" end="00:45:06.710">...kind of keep up-to-date with things.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:06.710" end="00:45:10.530">So, that was...now service irks.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:10.530" end="00:45:10.980">People play</p>
      <p begin="00:45:10.980" end="00:45:19.720">...service...pretty cool feature ok soflip that will quit.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:19.720" end="00:45:27.450">So, I can talk.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:27.450" end="00:45:30.980">Okay, good.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:30.980" end="00:45:37.250">Ok, so, in some real quick about extensions and in audio quick demo that</p>
      <p begin="00:45:37.250" end="00:45:42.510">So, just like...client where enabling extensions for esl and</p>
      <p begin="00:45:42.510" end="00:45:47.400">...fast and you can kind of think of this in the same...you can think about visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:45:47.400" end="00:45:51.900">...extensions we microsoft him basically the final set of places that</p>
      <p begin="00:45:51.900" end="00:45:56.800">you can plug into and we're going to expand this list over time?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:56.800" end="00:45:58.380">...now the focus is really</p>
      <p begin="00:45:58.380" end="00:46:02.930">on web extensibility so a lot of the places where you can plug-in right now if you</p>
      <p begin="00:46:02.930" end="00:46:07.590">...go...role in the early preview that we have...you can plug into a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:46:07.590" end="00:46:12.400">the context menus you can plug into a sort of the upper area there we can plug-in new</p>
      <p begin="00:46:12.400" end="00:46:18.910">...as we call them but,...we...to go with this is we really want to...beyond those extension</p>
      <p begin="00:46:18.910" end="00:46:23.450">points...those contribution points and...kind of...</p>
      <p begin="00:46:23.450" end="00:46:29.380">support things like custom-built tasks...kind of...server-side functions.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:29.380" end="00:46:30.890">But, just like with visual studio...</p>
      <p begin="00:46:30.890" end="00:46:36.160">we want to get to the place where we can enable developers to test an extension</p>
      <p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:42.190">...in this case is going the actual production via so...and...on</p>
      <p begin="00:46:42.190" end="00:46:46.900">...published that extension to essential gallery where other</p>
      <p begin="00:46:46.900" end="00:46:51.840">users can then finals extensions in easily install them into their via so accounts.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:51.840" end="00:46:58.240">So, we have some...I think it might we'll probably be putting more information out there</p>
      <p begin="00:46:58.240" end="00:47:01.310">...future about kind of where we want to go with this</p>
      <p begin="00:47:01.310" end="00:47:05.760">but a high-level you can imagine media is an account user can go</p>
      <p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:10.180">and discover extensions that are available to me...to my corporate</p>
      <p begin="00:47:10.180" end="00:47:13.430">...gallery or the public gallery and</p>
      <p begin="00:47:13.430" end="00:47:18.390">...install those extensions into my via so accounts and everybody now my via so</p>
      <p begin="00:47:18.390" end="00:47:29.500">account has access to that new functionality...extension is provided.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:29.500" end="00:47:32.030">this real quick...I will show...</p>
      <p begin="00:47:34.250" end="00:47:48.400">...flip back here.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:48.400" end="00:47:53.210">...through this really a kind of a high-level just to kinda give you a sense of things so</p>
      <p begin="00:47:53.210" end="00:47:57.530">via so extension is simply a manifest just</p>
      <p begin="00:47:57.530" end="00:48:01.160">like vsix with content.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:01.160" end="00:48:06.050">right now that's that content actually needs to be published in hosted</p>
      <p begin="00:48:06.050" end="00:48:10.670">...a server on a web server like agile website or roku or even a local server if</p>
      <p begin="00:48:10.670" end="00:48:16.550">...developing but the manifest...as kind of describes</p>
      <p begin="00:48:16.550" end="00:48:21.150">the basic information about the extension a has things like.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:21.150" end="00:48:22.960">Sort of...the aidid...version</p>
      <p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:25.930">...description and some other information about the person.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:26.980" end="00:48:28.330">In the case and the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:28.330" end="00:48:33.470">aso extension we have to kinda know where to go actually pull in your static content like your html</p>
      <p begin="00:48:33.470" end="00:48:39.690">yours new javascript css stuff like that so you can reference that from...extension manifest.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:39.690" end="00:48:43.450">But, then really...really more interesting is</p>
      <p begin="00:48:43.450" end="00:48:48.380">within your manifest you also then specify a set of contributions and</p>
      <p begin="00:48:48.380" end="00:48:52.860">contribution is basically something like an action or hub or something</p>
      <p begin="00:48:52.860" end="00:48:56.180">and we define...twenty five.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:56.180" end="00:48:59.980">Contribution points that you as an extension developer can basically</p>
      <p begin="00:48:59.980" end="00:49:05.150">plug into...reach contribution point you have to specify certain fields</p>
      <p begin="00:49:05.150" end="00:49:11.440">...names...kind of required by that contribution point.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:11.440" end="00:49:16.360">So, in this example in this act in this example actually exist and get so,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:16.360" end="00:49:19.170">you go to microsoft organization...get hub</p>
      <p begin="00:49:19.170" end="00:49:23.570">gear so extensions samples you can actually get to this code.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:23.570" end="00:49:28.430">This...a very simple extension that lets you extend the current</p>
      <p begin="00:49:28.430" end="00:49:33.070">branches menu in via so with a new main menu option that lets you easily</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.070" end="00:49:35.790">...branch so we don't have like a...click</p>
      <p begin="00:49:35.790" end="00:49:40.620">on branch option today in the via so web experience to the leader branch and basically</p>
      <p begin="00:49:40.620" end="00:49:44.640">...delete up to the server.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:46.280">So, this is simply just contributing</p>
      <p begin="00:49:46.280" end="00:49:50.030">a new action to this get branches tree actions menu.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:51.260" end="00:49:55.310">And, it's going to...run some code that we have</p>
      <p begin="00:49:55.310" end="00:49:57.710">is all javascript here.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:57.710" end="00:50:02.070">We have...quite a few other examples actually a type script so we have a whole set</p>
      <p begin="00:50:02.070" end="00:50:10.000">...script ...files that we include that you can use to kind of make...code your application.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:18.590">So, if I go and install this...that experience looks like real quick.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:18.590" end="00:50:19.180">So, if I go</p>
      <p begin="00:50:19.180" end="00:50:26.110">...my account level extensions talmud I can do is I can go install this extension.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:26.110" end="00:50:27.110">So, right now.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:29.020" end="00:50:29.520">Siosism.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:31.240" end="00:50:35.360">Right now you just have to simply upload your manifest file again it's kind of referencing</p>
      <p begin="00:50:35.360" end="00:50:43.910">...your static content in this case eye-hand static content all living...as your website.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:43.910" end="00:50:47.680">And, now I've...that...esl accounts so now anybody in my</p>
      <p begin="00:50:47.680" end="00:50:51.940">...so account has that new capability annette new capability</p>
      <p begin="00:50:51.940" end="00:51:03.320">is I flip over here to my code hub and refresh.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:03.320" end="00:51:07.880">Should have a new delete action now in my in my context</p>
      <p begin="00:51:07.880" end="00:51:11.080">many so this in exist before eigen now?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:12.230" end="00:51:16.920">Selected advantages like the javascript...</p>
      <p begin="00:51:16.920" end="00:51:18.140">And,...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:18.140" end="00:51:23.010">what this does is...uses are rest api is actually go to...apprehension</p>
      <p begin="00:51:23.010" end="00:51:28.680">...page to refresh so pretty simple extension but and just like the extensions that</p>
      <p begin="00:51:28.680" end="00:51:33.540">you can build for visual studio client there's a lot of really cool powerful things that you can do in a</p>
      <p begin="00:51:33.540" end="00:51:37.730">very short time that you could never have done before?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:37.730" end="00:51:41.380">So, pretty, pretty...you can do theirI</p>
      <p begin="00:51:41.380" end="00:51:44.640">...to show one more quick example.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:55.640">Because this is an app that we've actually made available as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:55.640" end="00:51:59.330">So, it's funny I was I was at the booth yesterday talking to people</p>
      <p begin="00:51:59.330" end="00:52:03.400">...over to another booth and they were talking about via so and.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:03.400" end="00:52:08.320">The connell was...be great if I had like a team calendar from my team india so it'd be great if I</p>
      <p begin="00:52:08.320" end="00:52:13.810">can, you know, have all the events that...my team and see everything kind of an account of...like that's kind</p>
      <p begin="00:52:13.810" end="00:52:18.730">of interesting we actually had...the demo sort of showcase extension</p>
      <p begin="00:52:18.730" end="00:52:26.780">that actually is just that so in this codes...and get have if you...look at it?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:26.780" end="00:52:28.880">But, it's basically a very simple.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:28.880" end="00:52:32.190">...calendar so if I go back over here this code and</p>
      <p begin="00:52:32.190" end="00:52:37.570">...I showed you this is a little bit morecomplicated complex but,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:37.570" end="00:52:42.320">it's the same idea there's an extension manifest.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:42.320" end="00:52:48.250">For this team calendar extension...contributing a...you'll see here in a minute.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:48.250" end="00:52:51.920">And, what's really cool also about this particular extension is the fact that it's</p>
      <p begin="00:52:51.920" end="00:52:56.770">kind of been designed to be extended so...kind of hurt your brain here.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:56.770" end="00:53:01.250">I talked about contribution points is kind of places that you can plug new...I'm inside</p>
      <p begin="00:53:01.250" end="00:53:05.380">devious a web experience extensions can also defined contribution</p>
      <p begin="00:53:05.380" end="00:53:10.330">poinsettia other extensions can contribute to and that's exactly what this calendar extension</p>
      <p begin="00:53:10.330" end="00:53:15.650">is doing its both providing functionality but it's also opening up at a point where</p>
      <p begin="00:53:15.650" end="00:53:20.360">...extensions can actually plug-in capability or new</p>
      <p begin="00:53:20.360" end="00:53:22.130">events sources in the case...this.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:23.150" end="00:53:25.210">Example.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:25.210" end="00:53:27.490">Okay, so, I installed it</p>
      <p begin="00:53:27.490" end="00:53:32.530">...so the right one we'll find out.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:32.530" end="00:53:33.890">So, the team calendar.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:35.140" end="00:53:36.930">Contributor hub.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:36.930" end="00:53:43.370">Which shows up here...the home area?</p>
      <p begin="00:53:43.370" end="00:53:47.130">And, what this is a simple cali...so we're using...opensource</p>
      <p begin="00:53:47.130" end="00:53:51.810">calendar javascript library called full calendar and what it's doing is</p>
      <p begin="00:53:51.810" end="00:53:55.460">it's making rest calls so it's actually calling the rest api that we have to get</p>
      <p begin="00:53:55.460" end="00:53:59.510">...sprint dates it showing you those dates it's getting all my teams</p>
      <p begin="00:54:00.820" end="00:54:06.180">...showing that information here I can add free-form events</p>
      <p begin="00:54:06.180" end="00:54:06.990">...storing</p>
      <p begin="00:54:06.990" end="00:54:13.770">...information in my sort-of...special...storage area?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:13.770" end="00:54:16.430">And, then now anybody my team can go in here see</p>
      <p begin="00:54:16.430" end="00:54:22.770">...the events see what's going on with the spread so again just a simple example it's adding get...the microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:54:22.770" end="00:54:27.360">...if you're interested in seeing...actually playing with it you can actually pulling</p>
      <p begin="00:54:27.360" end="00:54:36.240">extension manifest and upload q india so account and play with this today if you...</p>
      <p begin="00:54:36.240" end="00:54:39.540">So, let me continue on here I</p>
      <p begin="00:54:39.540" end="00:54:46.680">wanted to talk real quick anyone running at a time but I do want to highlight.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:46.680" end="00:54:48.470">I mention that, you know, we've had some</p>
      <p begin="00:54:48.470" end="00:54:53.470">...and partners actually start using this stuff they've been using it for a few sprinter</p>
      <p begin="00:54:53.470" end="00:54:58.170">a few months now and some really cool stuff is already been developed so,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:58.170" end="00:54:59.870">this first example is from</p>
      <p begin="00:54:59.870" end="00:55:04.550">...dev is one of our recent...a really cool tool to the</p>
      <p begin="00:55:04.550" end="00:55:09.920">baseline kind of analysis tool that's now plugged into the sl</p>
      <p begin="00:55:09.920" end="00:55:14.810">you can do a lot of they have a lot of really good capabilities that now instead of sitting sort</p>
      <p begin="00:55:14.810" end="00:55:21.000">of outside india so outside of dvs now sit within the sl ...here you can go talk to them</p>
      <p begin="00:55:21.000" end="00:55:25.500">...nca see this action.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:25.500" end="00:55:28.900">Jeff levinson of former...now</p>
      <p begin="00:55:28.900" end="00:55:33.870">...pm built something called work item visualize are so this is a really cool</p>
      <p begin="00:55:33.870" end="00:55:37.870">way...sort of visually understand linkages between work...again</p>
      <p begin="00:55:37.870" end="00:55:43.680">...extension making use of the rest api...information.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:43.680" end="00:55:46.980">And, then just a quick example obviously whereas built</p>
      <p begin="00:55:46.980" end="00:55:50.370">...impact analysis tool...</p>
      <p begin="00:55:51.500" end="00:55:56.390">it's kind of on top of sort-of your planning process and your work items...can kind of define</p>
      <p begin="00:55:56.390" end="00:55:59.510">sort of impacts of a particular work item...different categories.</p>

      <p begin="00:56:04.230" end="00:56:08.430">they'll be chicago next week but pretty cool to another good example of an</p>
      <p begin="00:56:08.430" end="00:56:16.120">extension that is using this new extensibility framework that we built for...</p>
      <p begin="00:56:16.120" end="00:56:18.560">Ok.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:18.560" end="00:56:23.000">lots of places to get your and here a lot less places star here so.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:23.000" end="00:56:26.590">We have this sort of a combined bs integration</p>

      <p begin="00:57:27.210" end="00:57:29.660">Okay, there's like a lot of people...somebody had done</p>
      <p begin="00:57:29.660" end="00:57:35.310">that since there if you're interested in playing with like the</p>

      <p begin="00:58:17.040" end="00:58:18.280">A few minutes for questions.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:19.450" end="00:58:23.300">Have approximately one-minute...course we always</p>
      <p begin="00:58:23.300" end="00:58:36.130">stay after to ironing questions in the from here to...sand?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:44.260" end="00:58:49.100">So, the question is will be able to use any of the universal app</p>
      <p begin="00:58:49.100" end="00:58:52.910">controls from inside the visual studio you can use.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:54.080" end="00:58:55.840">A you can use...</p>
      <p begin="00:58:56.870" end="00:58:59.920">Traditional as...controls you can</p>
      <p begin="00:58:59.920" end="00:59:05.520">do universal app controls yet but, as that as some of that stuff, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:05.520" end="00:59:09.460">they talk this morning about moving some of that stuff to traditional...controls as some of that</p>
      <p begin="00:59:09.460" end="00:59:16.850">...shows up you get...be able to users to you but not...once network made for you aps.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:16.850" end="00:59:48.810">The question of the...love to see some...to write that...</p>
      <p begin="00:59:48.810" end="00:59:53.480">Yeah, so, the question is a some extensions don't play very well with other...for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:53.480" end="00:59:59.470">give...of the...so there are two ways to do with this so one is guidance from</p>
      <p begin="00:59:59.470" end="01:00:03.810">microsoft so one of the things that we're working on is for extension developers creating some</p>
      <p begin="01:00:03.810" end="01:00:08.690">...but another thing and...probably the most effective way is the way for</p>
      <p begin="01:00:08.690" end="01:00:13.550">you as a customer and extension to be able to...feedback to extension developers and</p>
      <p begin="01:00:13.550" end="01:00:23.700">go tell them about...what is a problem with extension or how it's behaving with one thing where the other ads?</p>
      <p begin="01:00:23.700" end="01:00:28.610">Yeah, so,I think the way that we're we think that all of that feedback should</p>
      <p begin="01:00:28.610" end="01:00:31.450">...should be in the</p>
      <p begin="01:00:31.450" end="01:00:35.890">extension itself on its page on the gallery so there should be a...on the gallery where</p>
      <p begin="01:00:35.890" end="01:00:40.790">...community should be able to go and say...it breaks with this and it doesn't work with that and,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:40.790" end="01:00:44.270">you know, and, either translate that into bugs or translate that into work-arounds</p>
      <p begin="01:00:44.270" end="01:00:49.550">...translate that into something...have a...for the community to talk about and extension on</p>
      <p begin="01:00:49.550" end="01:00:57.690">that extensions place to collaborate with it so that's what we're going to enabling with updates the...</p>

      <p begin="01:01:35.430" end="01:01:40.330">I think the best thing is to actually have something that developers would want to use and then</p>
      <p begin="01:01:40.330" end="01:01:44.940">...best that is get good reviews on the gallery and what we're going</p>

      <p begin="01:02:07.590" end="01:02:19.390">accessibility and more about any business that your...</p>
      <p begin="01:02:19.390" end="01:02:20.910">Yeah, so, that.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:20.910" end="01:02:26.600">The question is a very plan for commerce so,you can have centralized payment and</p>
      <p begin="01:02:26.600" end="01:02:31.420">it's on a road map...so one of the common things that we do in fact with the bringing of visual studio</p>
      <p begin="01:02:31.420" end="01:02:35.620">online it's more even of a necessity because with visual studio you could still have that, you know,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:35.620" end="01:02:39.550">...by website go downloaded from added...actually added to visual studio</p>
