      <p begin="00:00:12.330" end="00:00:16.100">today we're going to talk about that well the topic is tried-and-true practices</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.100" end="00:00:20.750">for transforming sharepoint solutions that...ready solutions and this is something</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.750" end="00:00:25.440">that we've been actually working within the microsoft for quite a long-time with many of the customers as well so</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.440" end="00:00:28.910">...helping...about while quite a few of our fisheries histogram</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.910" end="00:00:32.690">...customers to transform their customizations from the fortunes</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.690" end="00:00:37.490">...solutions and...solutions...solutions and my name is special</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.490" end="00:00:41.770">you want I'm senior program manager in office traces the five engineering and,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.770" end="00:00:46.700">I'm also to technical late or the coordination...for the patterns and practices guidance for fisheries</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.700" end="00:00:51.630">...and I'm steve walker I'm also senior program manager I'm on the</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.630" end="00:00:56.160">...sixty-five extensibility team previously I was on the same team is...we still</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.160" end="00:01:01.800">work very closely together patterns and practices...came out of like</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.800" end="00:01:06.670">...said working with a lot of our customers who were trying to move away</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.670" end="00:01:11.540">from their traditional development practices so everything that you'll see here today or things that we've actually</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.540" end="00:01:16.790">done real customers you can also get all this code and much more yourself</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.790" end="00:01:21.980">and very easy way to download consumes...show you a lot of that as we as we move</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.980" end="00:01:26.840">forward good before we actually star test out of curiosity how many of you are actually sharepoint</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.840" end="00:01:30.870">developers on just looking...of...room we were kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.870" end="00:01:35.880">expecting dancer to be honest because they're quite a high computation at the same time on the time</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.880" end="00:01:42.150">...and how many of you are actually shipment implementing sharepoint apps?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.150" end="00:01:45.710">So, that's half of sauced more than a half which means that half of the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.710" end="00:01:48.190">...doing fortunes code which is absolutely fully...of</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.190" end="00:01:52.290">...so no down and but with gradually of thinking true how do we make the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.290" end="00:01:57.290">translation that a new way of implementing does customizations and this is what this session is all</p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.290" end="00:02:00.910">abound and we will have...discussion kind of a high-level</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.910" end="00:02:04.980">...even a business or process level discussion about want us</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.980" end="00:02:09.330">to transformation actually means so one of what is the learning's what we've been doing with the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.330" end="00:02:13.580">customers during the past two years and how do we approach transformation</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.580" end="00:02:18.660">projects and we will be also revealing some of that stuff fun, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.660" end="00:02:23.330">releasing templates and process guidance and msdn pretty soon as I on this topic us well</p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.330" end="00:02:28.140">...so definitely help on your...deals online the...transformation projects and with the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:28.140" end="00:02:32.740">customers as well and we also want to make sure that we give you a learnings from the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.740" end="00:02:34.640">real-life translations so essentially</p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:39.520">...samples because we actually do this for living as a full-time</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.520" end="00:02:44.520">...job pretty much well you not that much anymore within a new role</p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.520" end="00:02:49.210">...just waving your hands but ...all...getting and,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:49.210" end="00:02:51.610">then what we wanted to do is that we...make kind of...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:51.610" end="00:02:56.750">few typical sharepoint app model customizations transformations what does it mean and what's,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.750" end="00:03:01.010">what's actually to advent the...of moving the cloud data...repeat some of the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.010" end="00:03:03.340">...done previously,... tech at</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.340" end="00:03:07.930">...because you've probably seen some of...demos as well but...wanted to make slightly more</p>
      <p begin="00:03:07.930" end="00:03:12.230">...scenarios...want to show really well how...how you can take advantage of the microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.230" end="00:03:17.260">usher at to really be the engine for your...five</p>
      <p begin="00:03:17.260" end="00:03:22.160">and cloud based implementations if you're doing on prime ad their slightly different alternatives to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.160" end="00:03:26.910">do similar staff but let's talk about those during demos as well and,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.910" end="00:03:29.200">we definitely want to show you the rubric</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.240" end="00:03:33.950">...testify patterns and practices provisioning engine what's will help you</p>
      <p begin="00:03:33.950" end="00:03:39.110">to create templates and template ing systems within the cloud...this really,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.110" end="00:03:41.120">really new stuff what's not getting really,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:44.670">really stable just this week...just this week actually the,...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.670" end="00:03:48.010">the first introduction window went live during this way so we really want to show that</p>
      <p begin="00:03:48.010" end="00:03:52.140">pointy practice for us now if you have any questions and hopefully get as excited</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52.140" end="00:03:59.150">...we are on that engine which should help the failed on data...of the cloud?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:59.150" end="00:04:04.930">Yeah, so, for those we haven't seen it, you know, we do have a fairly compelling developer vision it's</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.930" end="00:04:10.140">...just a little bit we still absolutely believe in what traditionally</p>
      <p begin="00:04:10.140" end="00:04:13.760">folks would call office after sharepoint...which is really what's over on the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.760" end="00:04:18.100">user's side of the equation so we call those contextual application so putting</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.100" end="00:04:23.640">application surfacing them where users are doing their work and, then that really where a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.640" end="00:04:27.920">our investments now are really on this data side so you'll hear us talking about three</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.920" end="00:04:32.680">sixty five api and you'll hear us talking about all of the great api endpoints that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:32.680" end="00:04:37.430">we're doing a across not just sharepoint but also the rest of the workloads</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.430" end="00:04:43.270">so that's one thing I want you guys to walker to things there's two things I would walk out of this room today</p>
      <p begin="00:04:43.270" end="00:04:48.580">when you think about this developer vision is one we still care about the your traditional scenario...going to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:48.580" end="00:04:53.510">unlock new scenarios across the sweet so you're not just going to be a sharepoint developer you'll be able to develop</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53.510" end="00:04:58.870">a gift exchange and other areas of...sixty-five so, you'll hear a lot of folks actually</p>
      <p begin="00:04:58.870" end="00:05:03.830">we'll talk about that in a few minutes...saying why should I learn this thing when there's that new three</p>
      <p begin="00:05:03.830" end="00:05:08.060">sixty five api thing those things will come together and they're going</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.060" end="00:05:12.800">to come together very soon so the investments that you're making today on either side of this</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12.800" end="00:05:17.720">of investments that will payoff in the future of should you start to build standalone</p>
      <p begin="00:05:17.720" end="00:05:22.060">...things that ager we do have an actually quite nice announcements at related on the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.060" end="00:05:24.590">...as well on that one so one of the things</p>
      <p begin="00:05:24.590" end="00:05:28.770">...wanted to do also within the session let's say we wanted to start with the common kind</p>
      <p begin="00:05:28.770" end="00:05:34.250">...statements what the field this...to us all the times when one of make really share that you understand what</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.250" end="00:05:38.760">...talking when we moved adapt model what doesn't actually mean and what are the steps and also the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.760" end="00:05:43.960">statements related on sharepoint asher server...as an example related on the full</p>
      <p begin="00:05:43.960" end="00:05:48.820">...to related on up...so you will have quite a few slides</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.820" end="00:05:53.900">as an introduction topic which are having statements and then going to work venture to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.900" end="00:05:59.370">get within the audience before we move into does demos on data topics and but,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:59.370" end="00:06:03.980">we really want to make sure that you understand when I talk about the app model transformation it actually</p>
      <p begin="00:06:03.980" end="00:06:09.060">means of rewrite it really means that you cannot actually...server-side code</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.060" end="00:06:13.580">and test magically...of with some magical tooling what's will suddenly come up</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.580" end="00:06:18.090">within app model implementation that's not reality because quite often we need to</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.090" end="00:06:22.820">think about completely alternative ways to light up the same functionality using the end</p>
      <p begin="00:06:22.820" end="00:06:26.380">up model techniques and I would say when I was still in the field when I would engage</p>
      <p begin="00:06:26.380" end="00:06:28.270">...these projects quite often I would go into a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:28.270" end="00:06:33.120">customer we're not even transforming to a different model but you would step back and look at what they've built a new</p>
      <p begin="00:06:33.120" end="00:06:37.070">would decide that maybe there's a better way to do this I used I used to use a story where I went</p>
      <p begin="00:06:37.070" end="00:06:41.060">into a customer one-time and they were having some challenges with</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.060" end="00:06:45.300">their sharepoint implementation and I go in and I look...inventory of the customizations and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.300" end="00:06:49.040">they had fifty-five master pages they had a hundred and eighty six page</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.040" end="00:06:54.280">layout or noam's ninety...page layouts and they had a hundred eighty six unique dot net web</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.280" end="00:06:59.750">parts they had written and you of course that sounds a little sketchy when you when...say that so,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:59.750" end="00:07:02.960">we dove...we rolled up our sleeves and what we ended up with</p>
      <p begin="00:07:02.960" end="00:07:07.500">was one master page about six page layouts and we replace ninety percent of those web</p>
      <p begin="00:07:07.500" end="00:07:12.020">parts with a out-of-the-boxcontent query what parts so, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:12.020" end="00:07:13.880">this is an excellent opportunity</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.880" end="00:07:20.300">to look at what has been developed before and if there's a better way to do it?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:20.300" end="00:07:23.520">And, that's really the...point to understand the functionality</p>
      <p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:28.160">and the business requirements they're not going to go away...what we need to do is think about ok is</p>
      <p begin="00:07:28.160" end="00:07:33.300">the business requirements on there and we can absolutely have...and, we need to have the discussion with</p>
      <p begin="00:07:33.300" end="00:07:38.270">the customer do we need to still actually have this capability what does it mean within the app model is</p>
      <p begin="00:07:38.270" end="00:07:43.030">this birth of the investment quite often what...within the...that was one customer had one</p>
      <p begin="00:07:43.030" end="00:07:46.440">hundred twenty double sp...says within the dedicated form</p>
      <p begin="00:07:46.440" end="00:07:50.400">...actually eighty nine of them where waste ...trying to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:56.000">win so we were able to concentrate on twenty-one or whatever we ended up being</p>
      <p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:08:01.310">...looking to the actual functionality which when it to transform so the functionality</p>
      <p begin="00:08:01.310" end="00:08:06.580">...for comments is still there and, that's usually the case even in a farm solution implementation...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.580" end="00:08:11.530">steaks the longest time the technical implantation when of think of it that's relatively simple in the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:11.530" end="00:08:16.010">end but figuring out what the custom actually once not so...the difficult part</p>
      <p begin="00:08:16.010" end="00:08:19.910">...fact that...deploying the must debates using a module element in</p>

      <p begin="00:08:43.950" end="00:08:48.950">that we don't and the transformation is such a unique thing...we need to look on the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:48.950" end="00:08:53.250">function nowadays one by one we don't have a tool which will just metric come up with a</p>

      <p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:03.390">we're able to understand what to customize actually having rightnow within the...but it's not about</p>

      <p begin="00:09:11.790" end="00:09:16.410">One of the things what we also want to make sure that is that the common question well-defined solutions</p>
      <p begin="00:09:16.410" end="00:09:20.660">...in sharepoint server...will be absolutely...and say what we want</p>

      <p begin="00:09:29.070" end="00:09:31.790">and it comes down and they will be supported and sharepoint server</p>

      <p begin="00:20:58.930" end="00:21:04.430">...frame isolate...way and I want to be really, really clear with folks?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:04.430" end="00:21:09.170">People a lot of times look at our app model they say wow there's, there's all these different options we used to</p>

      <p begin="00:21:19.490" end="00:21:24.220">You probably shouldn't be looking at sharepoint hosted now there's some instances where it's useful</p>
      <p begin="00:21:24.220" end="00:21:27.950">...enterprise perspective but, you're default thinking should be to the</p>
      <p begin="00:21:27.950" end="00:21:32.520">provider hosted model just because it gives you so much more capability the sand</p>

      <p begin="00:22:02.130" end="00:22:06.750">...security perspective so sharepoint...really were built with that target in</p>
      <p begin="00:22:06.750" end="00:22:11.680">mind...so trying to jam that into an enterprise scenario I've yet to</p>

      <p begin="00:22:30.180" end="00:22:36.040">was very compelling I argue that you probably added more sharepoint</p>
      <p begin="00:22:36.040" end="00:22:40.920">servers to your form a and paid licensing for that then if you to</p>
      <p begin="00:22:40.920" end="00:22:45.480">just stood that custom code up in ios but that's probably a philosophical argument that we could have</p>

      <p begin="00:22:49.980" end="00:22:53.880">recommend from enterprise side are very much the provider</p>
      <p begin="00:22:53.880" end="00:23:01.300">hosted model okay you won't hear us talking much about sharepoint hosted and there's a reason.</p>

      <p begin="00:24:12.900" end="00:24:17.710">...just go down from solution code but then we realized that actually that doesn't explain how</p>
      <p begin="00:24:17.710" end="00:24:22.230">the inches using the functionality it's much more beneficial to schedule</p>

      <p begin="00:24:31.840" end="00:24:36.810">translation and then we do planning which is essentially the high-level thinking of</p>

      <p begin="00:27:26.780" end="00:27:31.190">...recorded us well it was first called javascript injection pattern but then somebody said that</p>
      <p begin="00:27:31.190" end="00:27:34.560">well the injection doesn't sound good to...changed the name to be javascript</p>

      <p begin="00:27:44.890" end="00:27:47.220">I'm going to explain...slide...going to do a</p>
      <p begin="00:27:47.220" end="00:27:51.860">...on this one so what we're going to do is that as part of the...provisioning...as part of the</p>

      <p begin="00:28:35.420" end="00:28:40.310">functionalities what's on available for the...in this particular case we're actually going to show you</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.310" end="00:28:45.100">how to do a top-level navigation for example, across site collection navigation which is</p>

      <p begin="00:28:55.980" end="00:29:00.760">to overwrite out-of-the-box must debates and there's this multiple reasons for that we're not going to go to detail</p>
      <p begin="00:29:00.760" end="00:29:05.620">...one we actually have eight hours of virtual academy training out of microsoft virtual</p>
      <p begin="00:29:05.620" end="00:29:11.040">academy if you'd like to go into the weeds with those recommendations so...go too much into that</p>
      <p begin="00:29:11.040" end="00:29:16.010">with this I'm going to cut over to my machine here?</p>
      <p begin="00:29:16.010" end="00:29:18.320">I think.</p>

      <p begin="00:29:21.580" end="00:29:26.320">All right so again if you saw on the slide we have a link in the dec you can get</p>
      <p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:31.040">it later it's out on get hub every one of these demos...on get hub you can pull them down you can</p>
      <p begin="00:29:31.040" end="00:29:35.460">...five them I'm going to show you just a real high-level how that</p>
      <p begin="00:29:35.460" end="00:29:41.390">works so just assume all I've done is I've pulled down this code sample from our get of repo</p>
      <p begin="00:29:41.390" end="00:29:46.520">which is great and it's got a few solutions here couple solutions here it's got my actual</p>

      <p begin="00:29:49.570" end="00:29:54.380">at manifest that's the part that actually...sharepoint and then it's got a provider hosted</p>
      <p begin="00:29:54.380" end="00:30:00.020">...web project here really all I had to do a...pulled down from get</p>
      <p begin="00:30:00.020" end="00:30:04.590">...is all I had to do was coming here and give it my site url for where my</p>
      <p begin="00:30:04.590" end="00:30:08.950">developer site collection is that was it I pasted the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:08.950" end="00:30:13.610">...developer site collection in my office we sixty-five tenet and now I'm going to come back over here and I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:30:13.610" end="00:30:15.340">hit a five so,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:15.340" end="00:30:20.760">I'll show you what it does first and then we'll jump in and we'll actually look at how it's doing it so,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:20.760" end="00:30:23.850">this is a really simple example these types of things are</p>
      <p begin="00:30:23.850" end="00:30:28.740">typically done as part of a site provisioning process you'll hear...talk about things</p>
      <p begin="00:30:28.740" end="00:30:34.210">like remote provisioning that's definitely a pattern that you should get familiar with and,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:34.210" end="00:30:41.420">we can show you a little bit more in subsequent demos?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:41.420" end="00:30:44.620">Input in my password.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:44.620" end="00:30:49.000">Typically...these the first-time you'll get a dialogue that asks if you trust it things inside</p>

      <p begin="00:30:53.550" end="00:30:57.820">samples actually gives you a nice little screen here that talks about what the sample does</p>
      <p begin="00:30:57.820" end="00:31:03.000">...and gives you some buttons to actually do it so you can see here that it's really what this is going to do is</p>

      <p begin="00:31:07.750" end="00:31:13.060">of customizing master page or something like that this is an alternate way to do it so,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:13.060" end="00:31:16.770">here what I'm going to...is it says I'm...the second-level navigation so I'm just</p>
      <p begin="00:31:16.770" end="00:31:22.530">...button once that gets done it says that...has been applied to the host</p>
      <p begin="00:31:22.530" end="00:31:28.650">lab I can go back to site and you can see it so basically what I've done.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:28.650" end="00:31:32.950">Is underneath the...the...navigation here prophecy sixty-five I now</p>
      <p begin="00:31:32.950" end="00:31:36.900">have a second-level and I can put whatever links I want in there and,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:36.900" end="00:31:41.970">that's all done with javascript like I said?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:41.970" end="00:31:46.920">So,...I close that let's go look at the actual code so,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:46.920" end="00:31:51.080">if you look at the app manifest itself is really nothing interesting there we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:31:51.080" end="00:31:57.020">start from behind our default spx I am going to.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:57.020" end="00:32:01.660">Over here a little bit and show you guys.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:01.660" end="00:32:03.890">...scroll them.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:03.890" end="00:32:08.250">The page load really just does the chrome control but if you</p>
      <p begin="00:32:08.250" end="00:32:15.190">look here this is where the actual magic is happening so when I click that button.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:15.190" end="00:32:18.220">It is going to a method called ad js</p>
      <p begin="00:32:18.220" end="00:32:22.770">linked so I'm going to go to the definition of that and this is where.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:22.770" end="00:32:25.510">It happens so you can see here that we're</p>
      <p begin="00:32:25.510" end="00:32:29.810">setting up some urls there were set up a link to our...javascript so we</p>
      <p begin="00:32:29.810" end="00:32:35.560">written some javascript called inject navigation dot js which is part of this project.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:35.560" end="00:32:41.010">And, then here you can see...grabbing a collection of the existing actions so,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:41.010" end="00:32:43.260">the user custom actions that are already applied</p>
      <p begin="00:32:43.260" end="00:32:47.620">to the web we're loading them executing the query and,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:47.620" end="00:32:55.670">then from there we're going...scroll down just a little bit more.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:55.670" end="00:32:58.730">And, you can see from there were actually going through and were checking to see</p>
      <p begin="00:32:58.730" end="00:33:05.760">if are inject navigation is already there if it is we want to delete it and,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:07.450">then we want to go ahead and riyadh it so that way</p>
      <p begin="00:33:07.450" end="00:33:12.500">...run this thing and updated as many times as I like but,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:12.500" end="00:33:16.940">that really is that's it I'm just setting a user custom action I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:33:16.940" end="00:33:21.800">...some javascript and I'm assigning into the web that's pretty much the media</p>
      <p begin="00:33:21.800" end="00:33:25.970">magic now if you go look at the actual javascript itself</p>
      <p begin="00:33:27.740" end="00:33:33.000">which is under here so we've got inject navigation it's really not</p>
      <p begin="00:33:33.000" end="00:33:37.860">that complex so we've got some you can see here that</p>
      <p begin="00:33:37.860" end="00:33:41.040">were actually using local storage highly</p>
      <p begin="00:33:41.040" end="00:33:45.550">recommend so anybody who's done any really complex navigation queries</p>
      <p begin="00:33:45.550" end="00:33:51.260">and side of sharepoint with full trust code knows those who get quite expensive on</p>
      <p begin="00:33:51.260" end="00:33:55.480">the server so you probably took some support sort of server-side</p>
      <p begin="00:33:55.480" end="00:33:59.760">caching approaches so that your users wouldn't have to suffer through that pain every time</p>
      <p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:05.480">...servers wouldn't come problems there needs you still need to cash you still need to think about cashing but the</p>

      <p begin="00:34:13.510" end="00:34:19.770">storage or some of the old tried-and-true methods of cookie's those are all still valid but, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:19.770" end="00:34:22.880">perf is still problem even when you're in our cloud and,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:22.880" end="00:34:26.580">you want to make sure that you're doingsome of those types of things so here</p>
      <p begin="00:34:26.580" end="00:34:32.360">we're really just checking to see if something's in the cache locally if it's not?</p>
      <p begin="00:34:32.360" end="00:34:38.760">Here's where we're actually coming in and we're actually injecting a bunch of html.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:38.760" end="00:34:43.040">Into the page pretty option looking staff by pretty ugly</p>
      <p begin="00:34:43.040" end="00:34:49.410">looking stuff but hey, that's actually easy-to-read and camel anybody else's.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:49.410" end="00:34:53.850">But, essentially what we're doing here is that we are transforming the web control way the service</p>

      <p begin="00:35:13.610" end="00:35:18.890">patrons...think of it this is exactly the same model where how do you embed, for example,</p>

      <p begin="00:35:32.320" end="00:35:34.590">...essentially test-taking advantage</p>
      <p begin="00:35:34.590" end="00:35:39.180">...thinking it's not an app but we're just adding that's reference that exchange</p>

      <p begin="00:35:53.490" end="00:35:59.220">then do an app as such so it's taking advantage of that remote provisioning</p>
      <p begin="00:35:59.220" end="00:36:03.190">thing all of the demos we have a link to our office traces twib develop about</p>

      <p begin="00:41:53.810" end="00:41:59.120">Which is a create using a take number I said but this is not a marketing</p>
      <p begin="00:41:59.120" end="00:42:03.770">demos so this is an engineering...and its to at creating a document library using</p>
      <p begin="00:42:03.770" end="00:42:08.700">...some relatively simple stuff but now the difference on the on the thinking is that the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:08.700" end="00:42:13.120">...approach is actually spinning...and this a synchronous</p>
      <p begin="00:42:13.120" end="00:42:17.800">...so from angels a perspective the operation is extremely fast</p>
      <p begin="00:42:17.800" end="00:42:21.690">...what hanover happened was that the operation was actually added in the storage</p>
      <p begin="00:42:21.690" end="00:42:26.100">...and at the same time would that have been my...stories with job was actually</p>
      <p begin="00:42:26.100" end="00:42:31.240">speedup and that's now actually ongoing and running and within my asher so I'm going to quickly</p>
      <p begin="00:42:31.240" end="00:42:34.830">jump on the microsoft the...so you this one in practice?</p>
      <p begin="00:42:34.830" end="00:42:36.140">Because we should be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:42:36.140" end="00:42:41.100">sell still see and that executions still ongoing so what I have...the microsoft the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:41.100" end="00:42:47.160">...is that I've...which is continuously running...and what that happens this so it's</p>
      <p begin="00:42:47.160" end="00:42:50.750">actually in stop status for some reason...and running status okay what</p>
      <p begin="00:42:50.750" end="00:42:55.190">did an update that what that happens is that whenever I'm adding a new item in the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:55.190" end="00:42:58.550">stories q I have a hooked up with two lines of code</p>
      <p begin="00:42:58.550" end="00:43:02.900">...the web...so it will be executed automatically find a</p>
      <p begin="00:43:02.900" end="00:43:08.250">web of by usher whenever...on the story...so now this web chavis</p>
      <p begin="00:43:08.250" end="00:43:13.150">then taking advantage of the app only token and what it means is that in my</p>
      <p begin="00:43:13.150" end="00:43:16.420">quantify in my app conflict we have...</p>
      <p begin="00:43:17.690" end="00:43:22.620">...we have our configuration...so we have the need at client id and</p>
      <p begin="00:43:22.620" end="00:43:26.050">...client secret actually managed within a...the show...so</p>
      <p begin="00:43:26.050" end="00:43:29.710">...using essentially that client...and client secret now to connect on of</p>
      <p begin="00:43:29.710" end="00:43:33.670">...defined and then we do the modification in a synchronous</p>
      <p begin="00:43:33.670" end="00:43:38.390">way...so then I could have the same code the same project deployed...pointed different</p>
      <p begin="00:43:38.390" end="00:43:44.300">the sites with different you can do whatever you want absolutely because now this the act</p>
      <p begin="00:43:44.300" end="00:43:48.680">...and...has quite a lot of different commissions and it can do much more than</p>
      <p begin="00:43:48.680" end="00:43:53.150">...to create a document library it could start creating a site collections that...creating</p>
      <p begin="00:43:53.150" end="00:43:58.070">...are creating...case of science or collect information within</p>
      <p begin="00:43:58.070" end="00:44:02.930">...and...in this particular case we can actually see also from the microsoft the share</p>
      <p begin="00:44:02.930" end="00:44:08.140">...which is really called the locking system is really awesome so we're able to</p>
      <p begin="00:44:08.140" end="00:44:12.920">axle a-c and the latest implantation and latest executions of the</p>
      <p begin="00:44:12.920" end="00:44:14.930">...and in this case we're able to,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:14.930" end="00:44:20.130">for example, see that the process process...message has been executed and it will success</p>
      <p begin="00:44:20.130" end="00:44:24.450">a one-minute ago so we're able to actually see what's happening within the...</p>
      <p begin="00:44:24.450" end="00:44:28.890">it was able to connect back on the on the sharepoint and most likely in the best possible</p>
      <p begin="00:44:28.890" end="00:44:31.900">wayne if you go back on the that sharepoint science?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:31.900" end="00:44:35.550">Have a look on the host...we actually now have a new document library</p>
      <p begin="00:44:35.550" end="00:44:40.600">...assigned not a suppress exit demo I know but from a thinking perspective and</p>
      <p begin="00:44:40.600" end="00:44:44.560">a synchronous processing perspective it's a huge opportunity</p>
      <p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:47.020">...start running alternative</p>
      <p begin="00:44:47.020" end="00:44:52.850">...alternative processes using the similar way of implementation?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:52.850" end="00:44:57.970">And, quickly looking and the...so, we don't actually need to have...on that one</p>
      <p begin="00:44:57.970" end="00:45:02.650">...during the more complex demos some can access of break point here and I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:45:02.650" end="00:45:06.480">click one more time...synchronous operation and this</p>
      <p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:11.280">...for seriously six lines of code...orwell...depending on how many</p>
      <p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:15.600">lines to...a single-line and but this is essentially the operation and</p>
      <p begin="00:45:15.600" end="00:45:18.070">method what we're calling within the are provide a host</p>
      <p begin="00:45:18.070" end="00:45:23.210">of application and we have already created a syria object which is actually</p>
      <p begin="00:45:23.210" end="00:45:28.900">having a url and my request a name and what we're doing is that we are adding and item to the</p>
      <p begin="00:45:28.900" end="00:45:32.470">...within the microsoft to share with taking advantage of the stories</p>
      <p begin="00:45:32.470" end="00:45:37.460">...sdk and we're adding that methods and we are realizing that...storage</p>
      <p begin="00:45:37.460" end="00:45:41.940">...and that's pretty much that's like six lines of code but the map what</p>
      <p begin="00:45:41.940" end="00:45:44.840">...the magic is actually is on the web job</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.840" end="00:45:49.950">as side itself so in the web chops which has been already deployed on the microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:45:49.950" end="00:45:54.690">...the only thing what I need to do is make sure that</p>
      <p begin="00:45:54.690" end="00:45:58.430">mike asher connectivity and the...webster's</p>
      <p begin="00:45:58.430" end="00:46:02.710">...storage is point into the same storage asked the...the item which</p>
      <p begin="00:46:02.710" end="00:46:06.880">has adding does items to the q and then actually</p>
      <p begin="00:46:06.880" end="00:46:10.820">test decorate appropriately aone function call</p>
      <p begin="00:46:10.820" end="00:46:13.860">which will then help on me and essentially this will</p>
      <p begin="00:46:13.860" end="00:46:18.470">...whole decoration in here will make sure that whenever there's an item...on the stories</p>
      <p begin="00:46:18.470" end="00:46:23.390">q my web chavis...and then I can actually do whatever the business logic is that</p>
      <p begin="00:46:23.390" end="00:46:28.620">...I need to do so in this particular case as an example...taking advantage of the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:28.620" end="00:46:32.660">app only access token which we need to because we don't have a user</p>
      <p begin="00:46:32.660" end="00:46:36.030">...essentially elevating...this up only access token and then</p>
      <p begin="00:46:36.030" end="00:46:42.440">where accessing the science using that token and modifying the sites as needed?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:42.440" end="00:46:44.070">Relatively simple thing but,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:44.070" end="00:46:47.720">let's actually built on that thinking so let's take that thinking in a slightly</p>
      <p begin="00:46:47.720" end="00:46:52.820">at new level can switch back on the slide.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:52.820" end="00:46:58.330">So, on that same thinking let's take this slightly more on a slightly different</p>
      <p begin="00:46:58.330" end="00:47:01.570">levels so we think about sharepoint...on this all about sites</p>
      <p begin="00:47:01.570" end="00:47:05.770">...provisioning it's all of...typically start from the fact that as an as a</p>
      <p begin="00:47:05.770" end="00:47:10.700">...solution developer used to create side definitions...used to create web templates as an on a xml</p>
      <p begin="00:47:10.700" end="00:47:14.590">...feature frameworks...doing modules now when we are enough</p>
      <p begin="00:47:14.590" end="00:47:19.360">racist define we really want to move away from the feature framework implementation what we want</p>
      <p begin="00:47:19.360" end="00:47:24.120">to do is take advantage of so-called sharepoint remote provisioning what it means is that from a</p>
      <p begin="00:47:24.120" end="00:47:27.550">...perspective we actually create the sites</p>
      <p begin="00:47:27.550" end="00:47:30.750">...collections using see some and we seriously</p>
      <p begin="00:47:30.750" end="00:47:34.810">used to client-side object model to even create the site columns and content...to the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:34.810" end="00:47:39.810">...collections which we create as part of the provisioning and,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:39.810" end="00:47:42.480">on that thinking so essentially from</p>
      <p begin="00:47:42.480" end="00:47:49.190">...a perspective end-user goes to...selects a template...actually...that application</p>
      <p begin="00:47:49.190" end="00:47:54.600">...running on premises...and based on a template...a new science</p>
      <p begin="00:47:54.600" end="00:48:00.390">...on the sharepoint based on the template configuration now as part of hysteresis</p>
      <p begin="00:48:00.390" end="00:48:05.430">divide...by...practices we've been running that program for quite a long-time and...a lot of customers who want</p>
      <p begin="00:48:05.430" end="00:48:10.150">to actually do remote provisioning they want to take advantage of this thinking that we're able to</p>
      <p begin="00:48:10.150" end="00:48:14.370">overrides the whole on at xml and feature framework</p>
      <p begin="00:48:14.370" end="00:48:19.950">...of doing...so...that okay how do identifying what is my template</p>
      <p begin="00:48:19.950" end="00:48:24.450">well you could always create...xml which has than average and transform to be</p>
      <p begin="00:48:24.450" end="00:48:28.810">...see some but then it's still...xml so that's part of the...</p>
      <p begin="00:48:28.810" end="00:48:33.630">bothersome practices guide and we started thinking this engine which is still supporting the xml</p>
      <p begin="00:48:33.630" end="00:48:38.240">approach as well but we can do something really cool so what we can do it is,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:38.240" end="00:48:41.950">for example, the following business scenario the business users...be a</p>
      <p begin="00:48:41.950" end="00:48:46.340">...persons of...a business editors content...which will</p>
      <p begin="00:48:46.340" end="00:48:50.300">...using a process so they will have a dedicated science</p>
      <p begin="00:48:50.300" end="00:48:54.520">...template sites where they will code and create document libraries...</p>
      <p begin="00:48:54.520" end="00:48:59.460">needn't using their process and whenever...a goes to a new and request...a</p>
      <p begin="00:48:59.460" end="00:49:03.370">...collection what are engine will do it on fly which is</p>
      <p begin="00:49:03.370" end="00:49:08.190">open-source available as part of the patterns and practices guidance it actually extracts</p>
      <p begin="00:49:08.190" end="00:49:13.070">the chains is from those live...and provisions new science-based on</p>
      <p begin="00:49:13.070" end="00:49:16.610">...template so this way you don't actually need to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:16.610" end="00:49:20.860">create don't xml you don't have to create feature framework you don't have to create xml</p>
      <p begin="00:49:20.860" end="00:49:26.190">...you don't want to actually create templates within the sharepoint and we can actually bring this to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:26.190" end="00:49:27.510">...that's if a</p>
      <p begin="00:49:27.510" end="00:49:31.590">person we might have multiple different templates we might have individual</p>
      <p begin="00:49:31.590" end="00:49:36.020">templates for hr organization for services organizations for whatever the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:36.020" end="00:49:41.410">organizations within your company and the engine itself is as I</p>
      <p begin="00:49:41.410" end="00:49:45.970">mentioned it's open-source it's available...looking into contribution from the community and</p>
      <p begin="00:49:45.970" end="00:49:50.490">...but it's already in a relatively could...so, what we have is</p>
      <p begin="00:49:50.490" end="00:49:55.210">essentially an engine and I'm showing the key pieces of code because this is extremely</p>
      <p begin="00:49:55.210" end="00:49:59.870">cool stuff we have whenever you add and reference to the...pick core component</p>
      <p begin="00:49:59.870" end="00:50:04.220">...will give you extension methods as long as have a reference that...component you will,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:04.220" end="00:50:06.360">for example,...a method called get provisioning</p>
      <p begin="00:50:06.360" end="00:50:10.600">...probation template and what we can do with that one is extracts and</p>
      <p begin="00:50:10.600" end="00:50:14.820">...that...from any science compared out-of-the-box dame sign or out-of-the-box</p>
      <p begin="00:50:14.820" end="00:50:18.760">publishing site innovator and what we can do with that template</p>
      <p begin="00:50:18.760" end="00:50:21.960">is a domain object it's not an xml at this point</p>
      <p begin="00:50:21.960" end="00:50:26.820">...we can do...is that we're able to serialized...and save that doesn't xml,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:26.820" end="00:50:31.700">for example, the...store or sharepoint list or a plus system if we want to</p>
      <p begin="00:50:31.700" end="00:50:36.410">...but the most magical thing at least from my perspective I'm an old-school on</p>
      <p begin="00:50:36.410" end="00:50:39.620">...developer and is that I can actually use that</p>
      <p begin="00:50:39.620" end="00:50:44.700">template on fly with some extracting that site a and actually apply that to</p>
      <p begin="00:50:44.700" end="00:50:49.330">talk assigned and what will happen is that all the chains is what the ui</p>
      <p begin="00:50:49.330" end="00:50:53.730">what we've done using a process will be applied to...and</p>
      <p begin="00:50:53.730" end="00:50:58.450">it's seriously six lines of code right now if you take advantage of the...and practices</p>
      <p begin="00:50:58.450" end="00:51:04.710">call component which is a community turban program as well so let's actually have a look on this one we do</p>
      <p begin="00:51:04.710" end="00:51:11.790">have four nights at ten minutes time to actually run...the demo...</p>
      <p begin="00:51:11.790" end="00:51:17.210">So, let's stop to previous demo and let's move that this following demo so this</p>
      <p begin="00:51:17.210" end="00:51:22.420">one is provisioning and there's a lot...at this actually video recording which we already released</p>
      <p begin="00:51:22.420" end="00:51:26.140">and channel nine which showing some of this stuff as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:26.140" end="00:51:28.470">As is a provisioning framework a</p>
      <p begin="00:51:28.470" end="00:51:31.740">...so it's actually you can find this underneath...solution and...</p>
      <p begin="00:51:31.740" end="00:51:38.120">some practicesguidance but I'm going to do is I'm going to nf five...to show the basic</p>
      <p begin="00:51:38.120" end="00:51:42.790">ui what this solution is doing truy itself is actually not interesting this</p>
      <p begin="00:51:42.790" end="00:51:46.900">...the provide...that application which is showing self-service site collection creation</p>
      <p begin="00:51:46.900" end="00:51:51.990">new and it's after you an...business case what kind of you are you actually want to provide</p>
      <p begin="00:51:51.990" end="00:51:56.800">...into says benton itself is can be used using...shell it can be used using</p>
      <p begin="00:51:56.800" end="00:52:03.550">a consul application and whatever service code within the microsoft...</p>
      <p begin="00:52:03.550" end="00:52:08.810">So, there's our ui this could be at typical self-service high collection creation feeling and,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:08.810" end="00:52:14.120">...a project manager comes...a name like...twenty fifteen</p>
      <p begin="00:52:14.120" end="00:52:18.400">let's give it a url builds twenty fifteen and then</p>

      <p begin="00:52:21.470" end="00:52:26.700">use the templates themself are actually xml serialized xml of the template</p>
      <p begin="00:52:26.700" end="00:52:31.510">information but I can do is that I can also use and existing site as my</p>

      <p begin="00:52:49.360" end="00:52:55.530">some small changes on the template time so give me a document library name.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:55.530" end="00:52:59.390">...fool for is not good well we might have been</p>
      <p begin="00:52:59.390" end="00:53:02.460">...somebody else from the audience.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:02.460" end="00:53:06.220">Important documents exxon so let's add a new</p>

      <p begin="00:53:08.220" end="00:53:14.610">And, let's create that's and...that important documents.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:14.610" end="00:53:20.240">And, create the document library on that live template sign.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:20.240" end="00:53:24.100">And, now the templates at that new document libraries on...so we know that whenever we</p>
      <p begin="00:53:24.100" end="00:53:28.260">apply the templates we absolutely know that if it's working and that pro</p>
      <p begin="00:53:28.260" end="00:53:32.080">asks a important documents...going to be there the programme has</p>
      <p begin="00:53:32.080" end="00:53:35.950">the application dui science essentially trust what it's doing is that</p>
      <p begin="00:53:35.950" end="00:53:40.110">it's actually taking all the collecting the information within the form...</p>
      <p begin="00:53:40.110" end="00:53:46.320">deciding that's a request and...realizing...can actually show you the object in here.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:46.320" end="00:53:46.970">There we go</p>
      <p begin="00:53:46.970" end="00:53:51.670">...this actually collecting all the url request and timezone request and all of that</p>
      <p begin="00:53:51.670" end="00:53:56.700">...then it's...that to the stories...in the same way...within the previous demos I'm not going to actually work</p>
      <p begin="00:53:56.700" end="00:54:01.430">...on that one now...in a synchronous process so,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:01.430" end="00:54:05.640">right now it's going to tell me your request has been real record it and we'll</p>
      <p begin="00:54:05.640" end="00:54:09.940">pay process tune and that process is now ongoing already in...microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:54:09.940" end="00:54:14.480">...but technically...defy we don't know-how long it's going to take</p>
      <p begin="00:54:14.480" end="00:54:19.290">...to create a new site collection so what I've done is that within the example us well...</p>
      <p begin="00:54:19.290" end="00:54:24.410">can actually bypass this with a clean...so let me show you</p>
      <p begin="00:54:24.410" end="00:54:29.310">this one this my template...which is that the one where we added that</p>
      <p begin="00:54:29.310" end="00:54:34.240">important documents...going to refresh so making sure that on the left side</p>
      <p begin="00:54:34.240" end="00:54:39.300">in the recent section we have the important document this minus</p>
      <p begin="00:54:39.300" end="00:54:44.290">site so this is essentially we always start by creating a new site using out-of-the-box sites</p>
      <p begin="00:54:44.290" end="00:54:47.600">and template or out-of-the-box...definitions to be precise from a</p>
      <p begin="00:54:47.600" end="00:54:53.390">...so what will happen for that ...twenty...create a site collection using</p>
      <p begin="00:54:53.390" end="00:54:59.200">...sign and then it will apply...modifications on top of it so let's do this manuallywithin the</p>
      <p begin="00:54:59.200" end="00:55:04.470">project we have a bypass so-called...project so</p>
      <p begin="00:55:04.470" end="00:55:09.350">which is called a helper apply custom template what that this is</p>
      <p begin="00:55:09.350" end="00:55:14.460">the consul application which is using essentially ...token</p>
      <p begin="00:55:14.460" end="00:55:18.840">it's asking what is my template site which is extracting and what is my talk at site</p>
      <p begin="00:55:18.840" end="00:55:24.020">...applying and then we're able to have a look on the code as well so I'm going to just go here</p>
      <p begin="00:55:24.020" end="00:55:30.190">it's asking my template site...copy...template site url?</p>

      <p begin="00:55:41.930" end="00:55:45.620">On-base things about...as well and what's going to now happen is</p>
      <p begin="00:55:45.620" end="00:55:48.730">that the engine itself it's can actually do...point pretty</p>
      <p begin="00:55:48.730" end="00:55:54.040">soon on the meaningful topic and meaningful url so we have that</p>
      <p begin="00:55:54.040" end="00:55:58.740">skate provisioning template extension method in a web object and what I can do with</p>
      <p begin="00:55:58.740" end="00:56:03.540">that one is that I'm calling...and it's going to extract me a domain object which will be</p>
      <p begin="00:56:03.540" end="00:56:07.300">act essentially containing all the modifications what has been</p>
      <p begin="00:56:07.300" end="00:56:10.770">applied to that sites that template signed on top of out-of-the-box team</p>
      <p begin="00:56:10.770" end="00:56:15.740">and team sign so it's doing a delta compilation and it's giving me all of those change</p>
      <p begin="00:56:15.740" end="00:56:20.130">...which...been applied to that sign and after a few seconds</p>
      <p begin="00:56:20.130" end="00:56:23.960">...depending...timing is dependent on how many customizations</p>
      <p begin="00:56:23.960" end="00:56:33.870">...we have that template object now exists and I can actually do something like?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:33.870" end="00:56:35.640">Come on, immediate window how do I</p>
      <p begin="00:56:35.640" end="00:56:42.570">clear immediate window not a clear hundred lsm...sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:42.570" end="00:56:47.490">I can that let's read this one so I'm going to zoom in san ovaries and templates</p>
      <p begin="00:56:47.490" end="00:56:51.250">I can do lists and, I can do...can...zooming</p>
      <p begin="00:56:51.250" end="00:56:56.020">in a second so...showing me how many list of actually have on that site</p>
      <p begin="00:56:56.020" end="00:56:59.980">...able to say that as a one list we're able to do</p>
      <p begin="00:56:59.980" end="00:57:06.240">the list so it's a template object which I can modifying also on</p>
      <p begin="00:57:06.240" end="00:57:10.800">...in the memory so I can build on top of that extractor template if</p>
      <p begin="00:57:10.800" end="00:57:15.570">...this my important documents which is which was extract from the</p>
      <p begin="00:57:15.570" end="00:57:19.980">...and now what we're doing in the following step is then we are applying</p>
      <p begin="00:57:19.980" end="00:57:24.760">dot to the target sign so essentially this my apply probation a template thats when</p>
      <p begin="00:57:24.760" end="00:57:29.340">that's my data object or the domain object and again where using then the see some</p>
      <p begin="00:57:29.340" end="00:57:34.260">...the restful api to remote operations to now modified to target</p>

      <p begin="00:57:39.080" end="00:57:43.730">and xml configuration as a template if needed if you want to have a selection of individual templates</p>
      <p begin="00:57:43.730" end="00:57:48.410">and options its again...to you on a business case danger itself is highly flexible</p>
      <p begin="00:57:48.410" end="00:57:51.180">...from that perspective?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:51.180" end="00:57:54.410">Well, he's weight on to apply allows you might be saying well you just showed</p>
      <p begin="00:57:54.410" end="00:57:57.830">we save side is template with a whole bunch of code.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:57.830" end="00:57:58.210">No,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:58.210" end="00:58:03.250">we didn't has anyone here use save side is a template in...sixty-five</p>
      <p begin="00:58:03.250" end="00:58:07.930">...with...lovett are at so there's a lot of real challenges with</p>
      <p begin="00:58:07.930" end="00:58:12.780">save side is a template not the least of which it doesn't work against publishing sites if there's been an app</p>
      <p begin="00:58:12.780" end="00:58:17.480">activated on this site you can't save side as a template there's a huge number of restrictions there</p>
      <p begin="00:58:17.480" end="00:58:23.670">also it generates a definition for that site and then publishes</p>
      <p begin="00:58:23.670" end="00:58:28.650">you when you're creating site subsequently off of that template uses that definition if we add new features and</p>
      <p begin="00:58:28.650" end="00:58:33.000">...sixty-five or we do things you have to go recreate those templates</p>
      <p begin="00:58:33.000" end="00:58:35.020">...you may or may not want to get</p>
      <p begin="00:58:35.020" end="00:58:39.620">on that train I'm thinking not typically you want to own the</p>
      <p begin="00:58:39.620" end="00:58:44.060">site provisioning process and have a little bit more granular control over it and,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:44.060" end="00:58:48.460">this is really what drove us to build this and patterns?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:48.460" end="00:58:50.250">And, now if we if you are watching</p>
      <p begin="00:58:50.250" end="00:58:55.040">...ios refreshing dui it was actually krajina applying does change says we've got</p>
