      <p begin="00:00:04.230" end="00:00:08.520">...a...measure on the media team in the operating system group</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.520" end="00:00:13.240">...microsoft and I'm really excited to be able to have the opportunity talk to-you today</p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.240" end="00:00:16.020">about screen casting so today will learn how to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.020" end="00:00:23.070">develop multi screen device applications using casting technologies and windows...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.070" end="00:00:27.500">At the end of the session there's and evaluation so please.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.500" end="00:00:30.460">Give the feedback we need it's very important to me to get the</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.460" end="00:00:36.560">feedback so I can continue to improve and we can...together.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.560" end="00:00:40.990">So, today in...market there are a lot of devices screens and protocols author and</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.990" end="00:00:43.660">...users really care about is they want to be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.660" end="00:00:48.650">...a content from a small-screen device to a bigger screen out there</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.650" end="00:00:52.630">and there are different standards and upper ability...can make that tricky for</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.630" end="00:00:57.940">developers today and our goal really windows...is my promise you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.940" end="00:01:01.650">we're trying to make sharing our content intuitive reliable</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.650" end="00:01:08.860">and simple for both developers...for...that's my promise.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.860" end="00:01:12.910">One of the things we did at the end of windows...on one is really...out what</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.910" end="00:01:17.270">are some consumer feedback we were getting and some of the consumer feedback was that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.270" end="00:01:21.670">was really hard for users to discover...play charm that existed in windows</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.670" end="00:01:22.840">eight.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.840" end="00:01:25.800">Another issue that uses ran into was that they couldn't actually</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.800" end="00:01:30.980">...device unless...previously...that device there was an issue</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.980" end="00:01:34.290">in discover ability additionally devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.440" end="00:01:40.280">...only discoverable on private networks and yet to make some network changes before...you could actually</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.280" end="00:01:44.240">...device on public or domain networks.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.240" end="00:01:48.260">A...also wanted to be able to caste more easily to other devices than just deal</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.260" end="00:01:51.370">...a play to devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.370" end="00:01:55.060">We consistently got the feedback that it was really confusing to understand what</p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.060" end="00:01:59.810">the difference was between play to in project we try to fix that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:59.810" end="00:02:04.610">and people just said you know, play to just doesn't work reliably enough.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.610" end="00:02:10.180">We agree with that from a developer perspective...developers really gave us feedback saying that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.270" end="00:02:16.290">...too hard to use and every...applications.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.290" end="00:02:20.250">Device selection really should be able ...application and it shouldn't be</p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.250" end="00:02:25.020">hidden in a charm where it's hard for users to discover they really</p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.020" end="00:02:28.330">wanted to be in charge of the full experience themselves they also</p>
      <p begin="00:02:28.330" end="00:02:32.130">ask for the support for dip more devices</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.130" end="00:02:37.940">which basically means support for more protocols and they wanted to have converse api</p>
      <p begin="00:02:37.940" end="00:02:43.170">across all platforms because windows...you could do on mobile...you could do on</p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.170" end="00:02:50.160">the windows desktop and we really it was really confusing situation for developers.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:55.070">here's what we invested in...first thing we did is we converge all api across all of our windows platforms</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.260" end="00:02:59.850">we really worked on improving reliability and telemetry.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:02.500" end="00:03:06.720">Made it easier for developers to do very common task if you re easily one</p>
      <p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:09.060">...through application you made that really easy</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.060" end="00:03:14.000">...show that later we added wider support for common protocols out in the market so</p>
      <p begin="00:03:14.000" end="00:03:17.140">...from...you can now use...cast you can use</p>
      <p begin="00:03:17.140" end="00:03:22.800">blue and you can use a dial protocol comcast uses, for example.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:26.210">And, one of our main goals was to imparted developer so that they can</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.210" end="00:03:28.870">add casting tudor application in the way they want to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:28.870" end="00:03:36.290">add it and they can choose from the technologies they want to leverage.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.290" end="00:03:41.110">So, windows ten how can...get their stuff...media from run screen to an</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.110" end="00:03:42.710">...there's two types of</p>
      <p begin="00:03:42.710" end="00:03:47.620">connections their system level connections and those connections really persist throughout</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47.620" end="00:03:52.520">your windows session so it's really like the all project that you knew you can</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52.520" end="00:03:57.310">connect to another device using a cable or a micacious device or to a bluetooth</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.310" end="00:04:02.410">endpoint and as you move to applications that stays consistent and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02.410" end="00:04:07.350">...application-level connections so application-level connections now we're really in the hands of you</p>
      <p begin="00:04:07.350" end="00:04:11.980">developers so you can use...minus ten api...to act casting in the way you want</p>
      <p begin="00:04:11.980" end="00:04:18.180">in your application and that connection is really persistent for your apple only.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.180" end="00:04:21.130">So, they said system level connections you can connect to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21.130" end="00:04:23.410">...external device.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.410" end="00:04:26.550">External screens we support our cable america</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.550" end="00:04:32.610">asked for audio we supporter cable use be or bluetooth.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:32.610" end="00:04:37.240">Multicast has been one of the focus points for windows ten for us ...</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.240" end="00:04:43.510">windows...we added mary cast pretty late in the product cycle so we really askedthe</p>
      <p begin="00:04:43.510" end="00:04:46.190">...vendors to add a lot of that functionality</p>
      <p begin="00:04:46.190" end="00:04:50.590">in your driver and they're really result in a different experience as you</p>
      <p begin="00:04:50.590" end="00:04:56.310">has you had a different driver on your system as you...a different vendor so,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.310" end="00:04:59.920">what we didn't understand was we took a lot of that implementation that wasn't a driver and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.920" end="00:05:04.690">put in windows so that way we can make it more consistent and could really</p>
      <p begin="00:05:04.690" end="00:05:09.760">add a lot of telemetry to figure out really what is not working with the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:09.760" end="00:05:11.820">...we really want to figure out what is</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.820" end="00:05:16.990">a device that is failing for us and how can we make that better where's</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.990" end="00:05:19.110">...failing?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:19.110" end="00:05:23.350">And, then we also added a bunch of os enhancements using america standard and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23.350" end="00:05:26.220">...direct standards so some of those enhancements</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.220" end="00:05:31.370">are fast ip assignments so you can connect quicker to a device that supports that we added</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31.370" end="00:05:35.240">other enhancements like you I bc where if you connect to america</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.240" end="00:05:39.970">assed endpoint and that endpoint supports touch you touch that device</p>
      <p begin="00:05:39.970" end="00:05:43.390">...touch event actually...sent back to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:43.390" end="00:05:49.380">your sending device as if it was a local touch first pretty cool.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:49.380" end="00:05:51.650">I want to give you some inside and what we're doing right</p>
      <p begin="00:05:51.650" end="00:05:57.400">mary cast telemetry reliability so this is a demo slide</p>
      <p begin="00:05:57.400" end="00:06:02.270">of the final behalf but it gives you an overview of what we do with telemetry</p>
      <p begin="00:06:02.270" end="00:06:07.140">on itn as implementation level so each of these layers represent</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.140" end="00:06:10.800">...success levels and fehler levers we have or could have</p>
      <p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:14.290">and what we're doing really is that as you drill into these?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:14.290" end="00:06:16.140">We can really figure out what are the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.140" end="00:06:22.780">...we getting and what's the most important error we need to fix in order to get better.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:22.780" end="00:06:27.400">...and we just don't look at that on a global level let's say all windows so we can really</p>
      <p begin="00:06:27.400" end="00:06:31.910">photos funnels down to what's the exact build number what a drivers that are</p>
      <p begin="00:06:31.910" end="00:06:36.620">being used what is the sender hardware what is the receiver hardware what is the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.620" end="00:06:43.430">...version...so you can be very detailed about diagnosing issues.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:43.430" end="00:06:45.530">And, my promise regarding to</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.530" end="00:06:49.310">...reliability is that now we continuously look at those reports like</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.310" end="00:07:00.610">...day...look at those reports and we're really trying to figure out what reduces we need to fix.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:00.610" end="00:07:05.810">So, from...caster vices out on the market we've really been working closely together with action</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.810" end="00:07:08.530">...partners to make sure that we have a great experience</p>
      <p begin="00:07:08.530" end="00:07:12.500">with popular america devices out there.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:12.500" end="00:07:15.930">The screaming etwo...screen being pro have</p>
      <p begin="00:07:15.930" end="00:07:21.290">beta update available that you can download today that lets you take advantage of those</p>
      <p begin="00:07:21.290" end="00:07:26.930">windows ten enhancements that I was talking about so you can have a better user experience or you can</p>
      <p begin="00:07:26.930" end="00:07:31.640">...keyboard to your receiver device and just start typing answer projecting or you can</p>
      <p begin="00:07:31.640" end="00:07:36.660">...better connection etc.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:36.660" end="00:07:41.820">So, that the slide here is that if you download the screen beam configuration utility you just</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.820" end="00:07:47.420">...update you can go to beta and you can get that update on your device.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:47.420" end="00:07:49.020">So, the first-time I want to do today</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.020" end="00:07:52.960">...quickly demo how the system level connections are a little bit different</p>
      <p begin="00:07:52.960" end="00:08:02.000">today than they were in the past.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:04.590">For use windows key.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:04.590" end="00:08:08.170">So, what happens right now is that all devices are being that</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08.170" end="00:08:13.430">are recast capable are being listed here and what's the difference would windows</p>
      <p begin="00:08:13.430" end="00:08:18.220">...one all devices that are on that I can reach are not only</p>
      <p begin="00:08:18.220" end="00:08:24.980">devices that are...but so...click on my device?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:24.980" end="00:08:32.580">Magic is about the happen on the other...the other and.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:32.580" end="00:08:37.100">So, now I'm an extended...and I have my application on the other site can</p>
      <p begin="00:08:37.100" end="00:08:41.910">movement is a studio app around if I want to or can move...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:41.910" end="00:08:49.330">You can go to...this is pretty much what you've known in the past.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.330" end="00:08:54.720">Afterwards if you want to disconnect pretty simple.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:54.720" end="00:08:57.980">That's pretty much the inter to talk.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:57.980" end="00:09:02.970">we're really getting to juicy part the application of a connections where developers are in charge.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:02.970" end="00:09:08.220">So, there are three ways...developer can take advantage of the new api...windows tend to</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.220" end="00:09:13.180">...content the first one is called media element casting and what that is that any</p>
      <p begin="00:09:13.180" end="00:09:16.810">...is played...local media element cannot be sent over</p>
      <p begin="00:09:16.810" end="00:09:21.300">...receiving device and those receiving devices can be...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.300" end="00:09:27.730">cast devices bluetooth devices cable or a delineated vice</p>
      <p begin="00:09:27.730" end="00:09:32.960">so those are all the devices you can...media omen casting and as you see here there's a default cast</p>
      <p begin="00:09:32.960" end="00:09:38.040">button...the media element that already has casting enable if you just playing video</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.040" end="00:09:43.570">...you get casting for free...second one is remote appointee so</p>
      <p begin="00:09:43.570" end="00:09:49.650">remote appointees really are taking advantage of the dial protocol which is what comcast does?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:49.650" end="00:09:56.030">And, we are we are allowing you if you have an application on your hand-held device to</p>
      <p begin="00:09:56.030" end="00:09:58.720">launch a companion.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:02.830">Application on the big-screen device and start playing the content there.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:02.830" end="00:10:03.290">It's really a</p>
      <p begin="00:10:03.290" end="00:10:10.260">...opportunity for users if you want to just break into that market and there are multi-view apps what</p>
      <p begin="00:10:10.260" end="00:10:14.710">a multi-view apps multi-view apps take advantage of the projection manager api and they allow</p>
      <p begin="00:10:14.710" end="00:10:20.530">you to basically from your local sending device create to views.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:20.530" end="00:10:26.760">One of those...being rendered locally and the other one is being rendered on the other screen and that actually uses</p>
      <p begin="00:10:26.760" end="00:10:32.690">...cast as a technology as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:32.690" end="00:10:37.710">Some media...casting as I said anything that plays in a...video...can be</p>
      <p begin="00:10:37.710" end="00:10:44.130">...to eater bluetooth as the only device what we did in windows</p>
      <p begin="00:10:44.130" end="00:10:48.310">ten was aside from adding support for the protocols we did that</p>
      <p begin="00:10:48.310" end="00:10:50.720">remove the play charm as I said...that...is</p>
      <p begin="00:10:50.720" end="00:10:55.930">not there anymorethat also means that we had to deprecated plea to manager api that exist in windows</p>
      <p begin="00:10:55.930" end="00:11:00.990">...that api really heavily relied on the charm.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:00.990" end="00:11:04.850">So-if you have a windows ape on one application and you run that on windows ten</p>
      <p begin="00:11:04.850" end="00:11:09.630">...happen is you'll never get a device selected event anymore so basically</p>
      <p begin="00:11:09.630" end="00:11:13.720">...manager api is that.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:13.720" end="00:11:21.590">And, then you can add use the casting api...casting back to your when the...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:21.590" end="00:11:26.670">The nice thing is that the in a...element you get casting for free because it's just</p>
      <p begin="00:11:26.670" end="00:11:32.110">...the new transport controls that are there one of the nice things we did is that...for projects</p>
      <p begin="00:11:32.110" end="00:11:33.930">...we...cast into</p>
      <p begin="00:11:33.930" end="00:11:39.560">...by just using the mediaelement casting api as so that's the way for us to reuse</p>
      <p begin="00:11:39.560" end="00:11:44.170">...investment but is also validation at you can</p>
      <p begin="00:11:44.170" end="00:11:49.550">do very complex things with this api in your own...so when you want to use media</p>
      <p begin="00:11:49.550" end="00:11:53.930">...casting if you want casting at a lower-cost you want to reach a</p>
      <p begin="00:11:53.930" end="00:11:58.470">large set of devices one api if you don't need any customization on the</p>
      <p begin="00:11:58.470" end="00:12:05.420">receiving device because basically what is being sent over is the is the media...playing it's also important</p>
      <p begin="00:12:05.420" end="00:12:09.930">...the capabilities of different protocols that you can use using media omen</p>
      <p begin="00:12:09.930" end="00:12:14.700">casting and they are aware of the battery life impact when you're sending content because you're</p>
      <p begin="00:12:14.700" end="00:12:19.970">downloading on your small-screen device and...signing it over directly.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:19.970" end="00:12:28.950">All right so this is the first-time will be doing a...one of many.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:28.950" end="00:12:32.660">First thing I have here is...</p>
      <p begin="00:12:32.660" end="00:12:38.490">Student drawing correctly what I did is I created one of</p>
      <p begin="00:12:38.490" end="00:12:42.780">screen casting sample...guessing sample is available as part of all the windows samples</p>
      <p begin="00:12:42.780" end="00:12:45.900">...understand samples that will be distributed on...be going through</p>
      <p begin="00:12:45.900" end="00:12:49.960">the sample once-in-a-lifetime so the first on for media</p>
      <p begin="00:12:49.960" end="00:12:52.270">omen casting what I said was mediaelement</p>
      <p begin="00:12:52.270" end="00:13:00.070">...so...ten that all I have to do really?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:00.070" end="00:13:12.900">All I have to do...mediaelement to my page and then from then on I can start casting so let me show you.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:12.900" end="00:13:17.290">As a start playing my...bunny video.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:17.290" end="00:13:20.710">I can...cassette...</p>
      <p begin="00:13:30.340" end="00:13:35.850">Second but.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:35.850" end="00:13:40.770">...very simple so just by using that mediaelement I can outcast to another device out there</p>
      <p begin="00:13:40.770" end="00:13:45.740">and they're still about their where we actually don't miss immediately close the application on the other side but</p>
      <p begin="00:13:45.740" end="00:13:49.830">we're working on that.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:49.830" end="00:13:53.380">So, the second.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:53.380" end="00:13:59.160">...see...switch back.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:59.160" end="00:14:04.530">Aside from using this very simple casting what we also did is we introduced device</p>
      <p begin="00:14:04.530" end="00:14:11.700">...control you saw me used to select the device and, that device bigger control just really</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.700" end="00:14:16.450">is an easy way for you to list devices and it provide to all kinds of inline</p>
      <p begin="00:14:16.450" end="00:14:20.170">pairing ceremonies food it's just you can specify a full to</p>
      <p begin="00:14:20.170" end="00:14:24.590">for so you could say hey I only want to see delineated vices I only want to see america devices</p>
      <p begin="00:14:24.590" end="00:14:28.140">only want to see dial devices...want to see all these devices together and</p>
      <p begin="00:14:28.140" end="00:14:32.450">...picker control allows you to do that and as you click on a device you have</p>
      <p begin="00:14:32.450" end="00:14:39.390">...that picker control will also just as I said take care of all the pairing that is needed.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:39.390" end="00:14:44.010">So, how to use the picker control it's very simple as you simply declare one of the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:44.010" end="00:14:49.810">flavors of the picker control you subscribe to a device selected event when</p>
      <p begin="00:14:49.810" end="00:14:52.500">...clicks on the device and,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:52.500" end="00:14:57.170">you can customize it so you can customize things like foreground color background color</p>
      <p begin="00:14:57.170" end="00:14:59.280">selected color etc?</p>
      <p begin="00:14:59.280" end="00:15:03.060">Once you've done customizing the picker you can show it then the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:03.060" end="00:15:08.460">...shows up...user can then.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:08.460" end="00:15:10.910">Click on a device so once users click on a</p>
      <p begin="00:15:10.910" end="00:15:15.890">device you get the selected device back and then you can start casting so</p>
      <p begin="00:15:15.890" end="00:15:20.650">what element casting is that as you get the casting device back you just make one</p>
      <p begin="00:15:20.650" end="00:15:26.290">call...say request start casting...and use the casting</p>
      <p begin="00:15:26.290" end="00:15:32.520">...from the media element so that easy to kind of replicate what...done before.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:32.520" end="00:15:35.950">So, what I wanted to showing my next them ways?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:35.950" end="00:15:40.700">How can I use mediaelement casting but ad my own custom my own custom</p>
      <p begin="00:15:40.700" end="00:15:46.890">button are...a paradigm throughout the throughout the session?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:46.890" end="00:15:53.100">So, the first thing I have here is.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:53.100" end="00:15:57.900">Media...so for my media element I'm a little bit more fancy an added</p>
      <p begin="00:15:57.900" end="00:16:02.160">custom...media transport controls.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:02.160" end="00:16:13.520">And, those custom media transport controls will have my custom but if I look at those.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:13.520" end="00:16:20.180">What you'll see is...these transport controls simply have a way to get to the custom</p>
      <p begin="00:16:20.180" end="00:16:25.890">...button I just got my template child from my custom a template?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:25.890" end="00:16:30.650">And, on that button I subscribe to button click different</p>
      <p begin="00:16:30.650" end="00:16:33.090">ones that button clicked event is</p>
      <p begin="00:16:33.090" end="00:16:40.560">actually raised by reason external event to which I'll subscribe into my page?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:40.560" end="00:16:46.110">So, now I said hey I have a custom style well how do you get a custom style.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:46.110" end="00:16:49.740">Because some style here is based off engineered sample style</p>
      <p begin="00:16:49.740" end="00:17:00.910">that is available in your sdk and I just started customizing it and.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:00.910" end="00:17:06.340">First one I have here this is a default style these are the default media transport controls and</p>
      <p begin="00:17:06.340" end="00:17:10.250">what happens here is that there's there are a bunch of buttons in their stop up in</p>
      <p begin="00:17:10.250" end="00:17:15.950">...rewind button volume button et cetera but...also has a caspar?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.950" end="00:17:20.610">Right so this is the default cast but you...a previous demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:20.610" end="00:17:25.530">But, what I did now in my own implementation in my own sample file?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:25.530" end="00:17:29.080">I remove some of the buttons that you saw before and I</p>
      <p begin="00:17:29.080" end="00:17:34.080">remove the default cast button and I call my custom cast button so now I can actually subscribe</p>
      <p begin="00:17:34.080" end="00:17:38.410">...different myself and that's really what you've been seeing</p>
      <p begin="00:17:38.410" end="00:17:45.090">...a custom cast button here so if I go back to my code.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:45.090" end="00:17:46.840">I have my custom transport controls.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:48.370" end="00:17:55.520">And, in my constructor here I first got the video.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:17:59.740">And, what I do here is I get...controls my player and a subscribe to</p>
      <p begin="00:17:59.740" end="00:18:12.010">...button clicked when...button click depend inspired?</p>
      <p begin="00:18:12.010" end="00:18:16.650">...simply do here is...positive player.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:16.650" end="00:18:21.910">And, I...depict once the...shown.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:21.910" end="00:18:32.360">I got the...the by selected event.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:32.360" end="00:18:35.580">And, as I get the casting device that was selected back.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:35.580" end="00:18:38.040">What...here is?</p>
      <p begin="00:18:38.040" end="00:18:45.550">I create a casting connection I subscribe to all the events and start casting.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:45.550" end="00:18:49.410">Right here I start casting...selected device</p>
      <p begin="00:18:49.410" end="00:18:56.310">so as you see there's a little bit more going on here than...previous demos.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:56.310" end="00:19:02.250">What is also important to know is that when you actually use the picker what happens is the</p>
      <p begin="00:19:02.250" end="00:19:06.100">picker control runs in a separate process so as you actually would break into the</p>
      <p begin="00:19:06.100" end="00:19:11.060">...the picker...is actually dismissed and the selected event the</p>
      <p begin="00:19:11.060" end="00:19:16.050">...device you get currently is actually becomes it becomes null?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:16.050" end="00:19:20.220">The way to work around that is that as soon...before you break into a debugging</p>
      <p begin="00:19:20.220" end="00:19:25.180">...celebrate point is to actually get a local copy of that device and</p>
      <p begin="00:19:25.180" end="00:19:29.870">...version to the other process something working on but I do point you to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:29.870" end="00:19:35.520">know that's something you'll have to do if you want to debug your application.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:36.890">All right.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:36.890" end="00:19:40.330">So, pretty much the same demo here.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:40.330" end="00:19:47.640">I...default mediaelement...video playing I am a custom cast button that now</p>
      <p begin="00:19:47.640" end="00:19:55.660">because he's black because I customized it once I selected device.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:55.660" end="00:20:08.440">Content starts playing on my second screen again.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:08.440" end="00:20:13.430">The next way toenable casting in your windows ten app is remote application launching and as I said</p>
      <p begin="00:20:13.430" end="00:20:17.670">we use dial stands for discovery launch and that's really what it does discovers</p>
      <p begin="00:20:17.670" end="00:20:21.660">your device and application and the other side and just launches it</p>
      <p begin="00:20:22.980" end="00:20:27.380">widow worse is the following so I...really discovers all the dial enabled</p>
      <p begin="00:20:27.380" end="00:20:32.000">...on the network which could, for example, beer xbox.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:32.000" end="00:20:36.870">Then you get you...description back for all the receiving devices so now I know all the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:36.870" end="00:20:41.090">device...out there and...can really start listing them inside</p>
      <p begin="00:20:41.090" end="00:20:46.100">...device picker we ask for the application state for each of one of those</p>
      <p begin="00:20:46.100" end="00:20:52.170">devices and then when a user clicks on a device I can launch</p>
      <p begin="00:20:52.170" end="00:20:54.560">the application on the other side what a set of</p>
      <p begin="00:20:54.560" end="00:20:59.460">...parameters that's really where dial gets out of the way so discovered the devices once you</p>
      <p begin="00:20:59.460" end="00:21:04.170">pharma device then you're just launching...giving industry parameter and then you really have</p>
      <p begin="00:21:04.170" end="00:21:07.100">to have a as a developer implement that apt outcome</p>
      <p begin="00:21:07.100" end="00:21:11.840">...the app to app communication yourself?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:16.740">So, there's a sender and receiver part through more app pointing and from a</p>
      <p begin="00:21:16.740" end="00:21:17.510">...perspective.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:19.980" end="00:21:25.780">Sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:25.780" end="00:21:31.470">So, from a send perspective what happens is that we converge all the api across desktop</p>
      <p begin="00:21:31.470" end="00:21:37.070">...so we also are supporting dial one-point-six from for</p>
      <p begin="00:21:37.070" end="00:21:41.960">working on implementingversion two-point-two as well and api</p>
      <p begin="00:21:41.960" end="00:21:48.740">...integrated andthe device bigger control and everywhere else and in windows stand?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:48.740" end="00:21:54.510">So, from a receiver side we've supported act dial...xbox one since obvious</p>
      <p begin="00:21:54.510" end="00:21:59.510">twenty fourteen so in some of the major applications out there are currently already supporting</p>
      <p begin="00:21:59.510" end="00:22:02.820">dial-in xbox.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:02.820" end="00:22:06.890">So, when you want to use dial want to use dial if you already support dial-in</p>
      <p begin="00:22:06.890" end="00:22:10.770">...platforms because at that point really also supporting</p>
      <p begin="00:22:10.770" end="00:22:15.770">dial-in xbox is just a very small step for you if you want to provide</p>
      <p begin="00:22:15.770" end="00:22:20.230">a customize experience and receiving device because you actually are running and app</p>
      <p begin="00:22:20.230" end="00:22:24.310">on the big-screen you can just customized experience as much as you want you also</p>
      <p begin="00:22:24.310" end="00:22:27.720">...the communication between those two app so whatever you need to implement</p>
      <p begin="00:22:27.720" end="00:22:32.990">their your info control as a developer we also want to take device compatibility</p>
      <p begin="00:22:32.990" end="00:22:36.170">of equation because dial actually such a small protocol</p>
      <p begin="00:22:36.170" end="00:22:42.670">so well-understood the different devices really behave really well with...you don't have any of those issues?</p>
      <p begin="00:22:42.670" end="00:22:47.490">As using dialing you're sending media crossword most of the time you send across as a reference to the media</p>
      <p begin="00:22:47.490" end="00:22:48.760">...cloud.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:48.760" end="00:22:53.240">So, what you actually get on...on the sending devices great battery life because once you're actually</p>
      <p begin="00:22:53.240" end="00:22:55.980">...content that devices really you</p>
      <p begin="00:22:55.980" end="00:23:00.260">...the reference and accomplice are streaming let's say you're xbox and any</p>
      <p begin="00:23:00.260" end="00:23:06.310">of any of work on the on the sending devices done?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:06.310" end="00:23:12.810">Next step is ...showing you how easy it is to add the...windows...</p>
      <p begin="00:23:12.810" end="00:23:14.960">So, you use...you can use a dial picker flavor.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:17.830" end="00:23:22.820">And, what you simply do there is iq specify filter and you say hey my dial application amos,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:22.820" end="00:23:23.350">for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:23.350" end="00:23:28.520">consoles of video and what I'll do is that once somebody brings up that picker</p>
      <p begin="00:23:28.520" end="00:23:33.240">we'll make sure debbie only show...devices out there that have</p>
      <p begin="00:23:33.240" end="00:23:34.430">...video installed?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:35.880" end="00:23:39.020">Once a devices selected called...device</p>
      <p begin="00:23:39.020" end="00:23:44.580">...that method and...equivalent...disconnect.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:44.580" end="00:23:48.160">When somebody clicks...transport controls the picker shown?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:48.160" end="00:23:52.390">Many user...device.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:52.390" end="00:23:56.290">...outcast...doing that as we grab the dial</p>
      <p begin="00:23:56.290" end="00:23:57.720">device.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:57.720" end="00:24:02.650">...updating picker saying hey we're connecting we're getting a local copy.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:03.850" end="00:24:09.010">Of the selected device on the so we're calling get dial</p>
      <p begin="00:24:09.010" end="00:24:10.860">...video.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:10.860" end="00:24:11.980">And, never really launching.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:12.990" end="00:24:14.640">So, we see at the recast launches</p>
      <p begin="00:24:15.780" end="00:24:19.710">...string the string is an example but it's a pretty good example of what you,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:19.710" end="00:24:24.890">for example, can do for casting media we have a...code that allows the to</p>
      <p begin="00:24:24.890" end="00:24:30.380">...the cloud we have a reference to the content your currently playing so that you can easily</p>
      <p begin="00:24:30.380" end="00:24:36.280">pulled down before you actually have done the rendezvous and then we have time offset?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:36.280" end="00:24:42.340">Where you basically the position where you were...once?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:42.340" end="00:24:48.430">...six...can set...picker status to connected and all...itself.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:48.430" end="00:24:48.760">Disconnect</p>
      <p begin="00:24:48.760" end="00:24:54.990">us very similar when the user clicks on this connect you get that you get</p>
      <p begin="00:24:54.990" end="00:25:00.190">dial device that you want to disconnect from back and then on you-can call stop</p>
      <p begin="00:25:00.190" end="00:25:05.010">piecing depending on how to dial server implements stop...the application</p>
      <p begin="00:25:05.010" end="00:25:09.930">could just be staff or it could completely be terminated downloaded from memory if you</p>
      <p begin="00:25:09.930" end="00:25:14.510">dole one that type of behavior you could just user app</p>
      <p begin="00:25:14.510" end="00:25:20.810">to app communication and just lowly stop local playback if you want to?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:20.810" end="00:25:25.470">Onestop you think is completed I'm updating...status and say ham disconnect that</p>
      <p begin="00:25:25.470" end="00:25:31.450">...hiding...bigger so that was how you quickly add dial on the client.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:31.450" end="00:25:34.220">This is how you add dial on.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:34.220" end="00:25:40.910">The xbox one using the windows...implementation of xbox one.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:40.910" end="00:25:44.090">So, in my manifest what I'm simply saying is that hey this</p>
      <p begin="00:25:44.090" end="00:25:48.280">...it supports style and...video is my</p>
      <p begin="00:25:48.280" end="00:25:53.270">...protocol name very simple so what happens now as soon as application is installed and</p>
      <p begin="00:25:53.270" end="00:25:56.610">somebody queries for dial device that has come to...video</p>
      <p begin="00:25:56.610" end="00:26:03.320">...app installed the xbox one is being return is one of the results.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:03.320" end="00:26:06.100">When the application is...so many...</p>
      <p begin="00:26:06.100" end="00:26:10.610">device jan activated event in your application...called?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:10.610" end="00:26:14.280">And, what we did is as part of the arguments were telling you</p>
      <p begin="00:26:14.280" end="00:26:17.600">...being act activated for as a dial</p>
      <p begin="00:26:17.600" end="00:26:19.450">...dial device?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:19.450" end="00:26:25.920">So, if you being activated as a dial devised pretty...time at that point to start just</p>
      <p begin="00:26:25.920" end="00:26:29.560">...parsing the arguments so these are restraining arguments that we discussed earlier</p>
      <p begin="00:26:29.560" end="00:26:34.340">before I'm getting the video id I'm getting my position and I'm getting my</p>
      <p begin="00:26:34.340" end="00:26:44.810">...code from then on I'm playing the video.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:44.810" end="00:26:57.400">So, let's let me show you how that works in action.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:57.400" end="00:27:00.860">So, I have my xbox one on one side</p>
      <p begin="00:27:00.860" end="00:27:06.860">...look at the time and time clocked in start.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:06.860" end="00:27:11.730">What's happening here is that I have my xbox one.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:11.730" end="00:27:17.920">And, at my local application.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:17.920" end="00:27:21.920">I have the code here for the dial sender</p>
      <p begin="00:27:21.920" end="00:27:26.240">and the receiver so as a dial on the dial</p>
      <p begin="00:27:26.240" end="00:27:30.820">sender side I again I just have my media element.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:30.820" end="00:27:36.800">With my custom transport controls emait custom...</p>
      <p begin="00:27:36.800" end="00:27:42.330">That...here when.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42.330" end="00:27:47.830">A user has actually selected device I'm going to start casting so what</p>
      <p begin="00:27:47.830" end="00:27:53.170">I've shown you before is...this is a little bit more complicated little bit more complicated version of the code</p>
      <p begin="00:27:53.170" end="00:27:58.020">...into that but, what happens is that I'm calling</p>
      <p begin="00:27:58.020" end="00:28:03.670">the picker and you see this is like rap and really nice try catch blog?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.670" end="00:28:09.010">...way to do the reason for that is that if I break into debug are as I said before the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:09.010" end="00:28:14.210">picker actually doesn't exist anymore in is being dismissed so right now from</p>
      <p begin="00:28:14.210" end="00:28:23.580">...picket outside the display status will fail that's...that's...</p>
      <p begin="00:28:23.580" end="00:28:32.320">What happens...code is that based on the dial device idea and getting back getting my dial device?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:32.320" end="00:28:35.080">And, then I'm getting my dial-up instance based</p>
      <p begin="00:28:35.080" end="00:28:40.230">...the name so if the dial application exists.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.230" end="00:28:43.390">What I'm doing here is that I am launching my application on</p>
      <p begin="00:28:43.390" end="00:28:46.190">the other device once that is being launched?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:47.310" end="00:28:49.860">Really this is where.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:49.860" end="00:28:52.700">All of the app to app communication needs to be instantiated</p>
      <p begin="00:28:52.700" end="00:29:00.180">...need to run for yourself that's what happens on the sender side.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:00.180" end="00:29:11.080">On the receiver side what happens.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:11.080" end="00:29:17.630">You have the on activated event that's being...</p>
      <p begin="00:29:17.630" end="00:29:20.920">You have the on activated advantages be called.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:20.920" end="00:29:23.650">So, as I said and jan activated event I'm just</p>
      <p begin="00:29:23.650" end="00:29:27.630">checking the activation arguments and find my activation kind to be</p>
      <p begin="00:29:27.630" end="00:29:33.250">dial receiver if it is dial receiver what I will do eventually is</p>
      <p begin="00:29:33.250" end="00:29:36.920">...to my receiver page?</p>
      <p begin="00:29:36.920" end="00:29:42.550">...the receiver page.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:42.550" end="00:29:47.390">I will parse out the dial arguments...you've seen before.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:47.390" end="00:29:52.400">And, start playing the video basically I'm just roughly launching</p>
      <p begin="00:29:52.400" end="00:30:12.670">gap with the video I got past and, the app gap communications really part of this demo right now.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:12.670" end="00:30:18.350">Semi video playing locally now when I click on my device bigger</p>
      <p begin="00:30:18.350" end="00:30:23.340">...filtering down to all dial devices intimacy my xbox...your site?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:23.340" end="00:30:34.330">Now if you look at the other side.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:34.330" end="00:30:54.880">All...that's...</p>
      <p begin="00:30:54.880" end="00:30:58.330">And, you see the app is now playing</p>
      <p begin="00:31:07.970" end="00:31:11.110">Boom agrees that.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:11.110" end="00:31:14.200">Pretty great.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:14.200" end="00:31:17.250">So, the other part what's nice about this application is that and</p>
      <p begin="00:31:17.250" end="00:31:22.320">...everybody kind of internalize that this app is really running.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:22.320" end="00:31:24.940">Locally and it is running on the xbox.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:24.940" end="00:31:29.540">So, that's really degree part of that the way to quickly.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:29.540" end="00:31:33.360">Where you actually debugging deploying un the xbox?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:33.360" end="00:31:37.960">Is simply by?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:37.960" end="00:31:42.850">Once you have an xbox one that runs windows ten as a remote machine you type</p>
      <p begin="00:31:42.850" end="00:31:48.990">india p address of your xbox.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:48.990" end="00:31:53.870">And, then you can just deploy to your...so that's pretty,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:53.870" end="00:31:58.500">pretty...pretty cool I'm going-to try and deployed to the xbox to might be</p>
      <p begin="00:31:58.500" end="00:32:07.730">...remote debugging service that might have stopped and then we'll just have to start again.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:07.730" end="00:32:18.760">Right so that it's not.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:18.760" end="00:32:24.240">So, what I'm doing now is...connecting to my xbox?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:24.240" end="00:32:41.160">And, then so, this is hopefully something you would never have to do yourself.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:41.160" end="00:32:46.690">So, now the debugged should have been restarted my xbox and if I now deployment application what</p>
      <p begin="00:32:46.690" end="00:32:50.470">...before should work now.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:50.470" end="00:32:55.000">So, you see I'm just running the app now locally on my xbox it's loading yap a</p>
      <p begin="00:32:55.000" end="00:32:57.380">loaded to a default page that shows you</p>
      <p begin="00:32:57.380" end="00:33:00.710">a video still video of the casting part.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:00.710" end="00:33:04.470">So, that's really how easy will be to develop xbox one apps</p>
      <p begin="00:33:04.470" end="00:33:08.090">...my your windows universe lab that I can</p>
      <p begin="00:33:08.090" end="00:33:11.810">have be a sender on the client-side...I deployed to</p>
      <p begin="00:33:11.810" end="00:33:15.870">...sudden answer receiver...pretty great?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:15.870" end="00:33:23.760">Again, it's pretty cool right.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:23.760" end="00:33:29.330">So, the last way to...casting to your app are the multi-view applications.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:29.330" end="00:33:34.820">...back so multi-view applications as I said as you can generate to different</p>
      <p begin="00:33:34.820" end="00:33:35.320">screens.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:37.090" end="00:33:39.050">From one device.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:39.050" end="00:33:44.990">And, then project that second screen on america device...connect cable device so what we</p>
      <p begin="00:33:44.990" end="00:33:48.510">didn't understand was we really converse those api across desktop and</p>
      <p begin="00:33:48.510" end="00:33:52.520">...platforms those existed more or less on desktop before</p>
      <p begin="00:33:52.520" end="00:33:56.800">...now are completely functional mobile as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:56.800" end="00:34:00.650">We integrated them with the windows stand api and device picker control you've seen before.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:01.700" end="00:34:05.620">And, one of the big changes that was made from windows equal one is that you can</p>
      <p begin="00:34:05.620" end="00:34:10.040">now selected divisor casting to packet in windows eight-point one</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.040" end="00:34:13.900">...the first instantiate america connection and then you could connected</p>
      <p begin="00:34:13.900" end="00:34:16.840">...device around those two screens now you can really just</p>
      <p begin="00:34:16.840" end="00:34:24.750">pick that from within your api as so when you want to use multi-view applications.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:24.750" end="00:34:31.090">Multi-view applications you really can customize what is being played on a second screen so as I said that's</p>
      <p begin="00:34:31.090" end="00:34:36.700">a second view your rendering and you can run that I've us customers you want to.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:36.700" end="00:34:41.370">And, if you want you by doing so you really take advantage of the as prunes we've</p>
      <p begin="00:34:41.370" end="00:34:48.070">made...and windows ten.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:48.070" end="00:34:51.400">How do you addsupport for multi-view apps?</p>
      <p begin="00:34:51.400" end="00:34:54.550">Again, it's pretty simple once user clicks on the casting</p>
      <p begin="00:34:54.550" end="00:34:58.240">button...you do is you instantiate your picker control you</p>
      <p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:03.460">added device class saying this is my projection device once devices</p>
      <p begin="00:35:03.460" end="00:35:11.010">selected the picker device elected method is called and I'm showing my picture.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:11.010" end="00:35:14.510">If you've ever implement a multi-view apps...this is a very</p>
      <p begin="00:35:14.510" end="00:35:19.280">reduced version of what you have really have to do to instantiate those two views but once you have</p>
      <p begin="00:35:19.280" end="00:35:23.170">...views instantiated you just call projection manager start projecting</p>
      <p begin="00:35:23.170" end="00:35:24.690">...synch capacity to</p>
      <p begin="00:35:24.690" end="00:35:40.800">...views you've created and the selected device id to which you want to start project.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:44.730">So, what I did here is that?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:44.730" end="00:35:49.800">I created.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:49.800" end="00:35:53.780">I multi-view application multi-view application locally again just as my</p>
      <p begin="00:35:53.780" end="00:35:59.740">media element with my custom casting button and what I do is as I'm as I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:35:59.740" end="00:36:02.850">casting as...generating my second view I am</p>
      <p begin="00:36:02.850" end="00:36:07.290">...projection view page and that page aside from just having a</p>
      <p begin="00:36:07.290" end="00:36:13.460">mediaelement on there it actually hasanother set of transport controls?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:13.460" end="00:36:18.740">Where you can pretty much put on anything you want what I did want to do is ...</p>
      <p begin="00:36:18.740" end="00:36:23.230">difference so when I first was using media element casting what happened on the second screen device</p>
      <p begin="00:36:23.230" end="00:36:27.860">can really positive content there because there weren't any pas...controls or transport controls</p>
      <p begin="00:36:27.860" end="00:36:37.190">there so I want to add those and I'm adding these by using the multi-view...</p>
      <p begin="00:36:37.190" end="00:36:39.490">So, these controls are invariant of</p>
      <p begin="00:36:39.490" end="00:36:46.040">the transport controls you've seen before what I did do is I added a stop rejecting.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:46.040" end="00:37:12.840">Button to those, for example, and, will be using...</p>
      <p begin="00:37:12.840" end="00:37:18.560">So, I have my application buffering the video here.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:18.560" end="00:37:23.520">Filtering down to.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:23.520" end="00:37:29.850">Recast devices in my neighborhood are monitors.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:29.850" end="00:37:33.280">Pixel second launching the second</p>
      <p begin="00:37:33.280" end="00:37:37.680">wvu on the other screen and as that happens you'll see actually just my...what it</p>
      <p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:42.080">does it start buffering the content and...playing the content on this other screen.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:42.080" end="00:37:47.220">Additionally I have my custom media transport controls I added there so,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:47.220" end="00:37:50.440">I can going-to full-screen if I want to you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:50.440" end="00:37:55.420">I can stop rejecting I can switch diffuse if whatever I need as a user</p>
      <p begin="00:37:55.420" end="00:37:59.490">...cool I'm pretty excited about this one especially since</p>
      <p begin="00:37:59.490" end="00:38:03.180">as a developer you can really star choosing which of</p>
      <p begin="00:38:03.180" end="00:38:09.560">these technologies works well for you which of these...want to take advantage of.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09.560" end="00:38:12.760">That's my biggest point of the day is that as we've</p>
      <p begin="00:38:12.760" end="00:38:18.780">discussed these different levels of casting you can really start...so.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:18.780" end="00:38:23.400">You can combine mediaelement casting remote appointee and multi-view...in your</p>
      <p begin="00:38:23.400" end="00:38:28.370">in your code to make sure that you really create the best possible experience for the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:28.370" end="00:38:31.820">...user selects what that means is that if they selected</p>
      <p begin="00:38:31.820" end="00:38:36.990">...device you want to use dial if they select america device might be really good to create</p>
      <p begin="00:38:36.990" end="00:38:41.210">an experience that has takes advantage of the multi-view app system to generate that</p>
      <p begin="00:38:41.210" end="00:38:46.100">second screen in a custom way but if it doesn't support any of those what you could</p>
      <p begin="00:38:46.100" end="00:38:50.820">do is stand take advantage of the media element casting api as and just simply...the video</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50.820" end="00:38:55.440">on the other side so what I've done right now is that I'm targeting recast devices</p>
      <p begin="00:38:56.810" end="00:39:01.060">I'm targeting dial devices on targeting gianni and bluetooth devices</p>
      <p begin="00:39:01.060" end="00:39:05.990">out on the market and for a user that is one experience...one</p>
      <p begin="00:39:05.990" end="00:39:10.790">cast button and one way to connect to it mone list of devices after choose out of</p>
      <p begin="00:39:10.790" end="00:39:11.300">...get the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:11.300" end="00:39:17.430">...experience that is the best possible experience on the device.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:17.430" end="00:39:20.220">The way you do that in your application is by adding.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:22.630" end="00:39:24.460">The device bigger.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:24.460" end="00:39:29.590">Control...you add the device bigger you start adding folders so the first filter</p>
      <p begin="00:39:29.590" end="00:39:33.050">...adding is...show me all-america</p>
      <p begin="00:39:33.050" end="00:39:38.770">...devices the second one is show me all devices that can render video so those</p>
      <p begin="00:39:38.770" end="00:39:43.730">...my ideal any devices and the last filter is show me all the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:43.730" end="00:39:50.110">devices that support dial and have...also video app installed?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:50.110" end="00:39:56.690">When a user has selected advice...pick a device selected methods?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:56.690" end="00:40:02.260">So, the picker to the user right now so that's why I'm doing here the second screen here</p>
      <p begin="00:40:02.260" end="00:40:06.190">...really clicked on a device so what I'm trying to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:06.190" end="00:40:11.180">figure out in a simple version is a first try to see if...the device that</p>
      <p begin="00:40:11.180" end="00:40:15.210">a selected does that device like support dial.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:15.210" end="00:40:20.860">If it supports style I want use dials so I'm starting my dial casting right here.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:20.860" end="00:40:26.890">I'm getting...dial-up and I'm calling request launches...</p>
      <p begin="00:40:26.890" end="00:40:30.410">Secondly if my divisive not support dial all check to see if it</p>
      <p begin="00:40:30.410" end="00:40:35.130">supports the projection manager api as using...cast.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:35.130" end="00:40:41.790">If it supports, supports those...start projecting that custom you seen before.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:41.790" end="00:40:47.050">...my device does not support dial it does not support america assed because of</p>
      <p begin="00:40:47.050" end="00:40:52.050">my filter and...either support deal and...are bluetooth at this point and,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:52.050" end="00:40:56.570">I can target those using the casting api so that's kind of my last resort here I'm using</p>
      <p begin="00:40:56.570" end="00:40:59.480">the casting api...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:59.480" end="00:41:06.120">I'm calling request...on the casting source that was playing in the media element and I'm hiding my picture.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:06.120" end="00:41:17.600">So, that's really great way that you can add all of these together.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:17.600" end="00:41:23.920">So, in...sample here as you download it.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:28.330">The first thing that you'll see is out right now if you download the sample today there's two things after</p>
      <p begin="00:41:28.330" end="00:41:33.590">warning about first...the api is don't work in their kern build of windows you'll get but,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:33.590" end="00:41:36.610">also be fixed secondly you'll see</p>
      <p begin="00:41:36.610" end="00:41:40.920">there's some small work-arounds right now and as we resolve our</p>
      <p begin="00:41:40.920" end="00:41:45.790">bugsy out keep updating the samples so as you download the sample with the corresponding...have</p>
      <p begin="00:41:45.790" end="00:41:47.210">...decode become cleaner,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:47.210" end="00:41:57.070">cleaner but I really don't want to hide anything from you so, what you'll see today is?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:57.070" end="00:42:02.930">Is that what...through what I'm doing here is I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:42:02.930" end="00:42:08.400">subscribing to my player events second of the status and getting a video</p>

      <p begin="00:42:46.770" end="00:42:52.050">For dial there's a custom...filter I specified here normally you would just be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:42:52.050" end="00:42:55.470">call ...defies dot get the by selector</p>
      <p begin="00:42:55.470" end="00:43:01.860">...currently incorrect and, the same goes for on casting device</p>
      <p begin="00:43:01.860" end="00:43:05.610">get the by selector they all don't play well together when you're combining</p>
      <p begin="00:43:05.610" end="00:43:12.780">all these technologies and lastly there's a projection manager filter you...</p>
      <p begin="00:43:12.780" end="00:43:18.720">So,...many user.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:25.390">Some picker device selected get the idea of my device.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:25.390" end="00:43:30.670">I have device information...device information object is to general representation</p>
      <p begin="00:43:30.670" end="00:43:34.780">...a generic device that is being selected and what I'm doing here is</p>
      <p begin="00:43:34.780" end="00:43:40.050">at first I'm really trying to use dial failed on use my</p>
      <p begin="00:43:40.050" end="00:43:44.870">...to measure api if that does not work</p>
      <p begin="00:43:44.870" end="00:43:49.370">...use mediaelement casting and as you go into all these methods...really like</p>
      <p begin="00:43:49.370" end="00:43:58.010">what really revisiting what you...all the individual technologies there?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:58.010" end="00:43:59.160">So, if I run the sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:00.270" end="00:44:03.330">What's nice about this at this point is that.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:03.330" end="00:44:07.110">If I start playing content here I can really select</p>
      <p begin="00:44:09.030" end="00:44:12.680">...like my xbox or memory cast device stochastic content</p>
      <p begin="00:44:12.680" end="00:44:16.730">to so from users' perspective and windows I'm coming back</p>
      <p begin="00:44:16.730" end="00:44:21.270">...promise I made you is that you can now.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:21.270" end="00:44:23.760">You can all target the widest set of devices out</p>
      <p begin="00:44:23.760" end="00:44:27.770">on the market with different api supported them windows</p>
      <p begin="00:44:27.770" end="00:44:38.910">...we create one user experience so that's pretty great so as a summary.</p>

      <p begin="00:45:16.660" end="00:45:18.700">time to evaluate the session as well</p>
      <p begin="00:45:18.700" end="00:45:30.280">...the feedback is very valuable to me...thank you for today.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:30.280" end="00:45:33.990">Question actually there regarding chrome</p>
      <p begin="00:45:33.990" end="00:45:38.570">...airplane javanese so we supports croquet so,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:38.570" end="00:45:44.240">...question was do we support our chrome caster airplane we curly</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.240" end="00:45:50.640">support comcast as a device because they use dial as a technology are still.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:50.640" end="00:45:52.080">So, as you implement...</p>
      <p begin="00:45:52.080" end="00:45:57.480">on windows as a sender you'll be able to target you'll be able to target the xbox one</p>

      <p begin="00:46:06.650" end="00:46:08.890">For comcast I think they should still</p>

      <p begin="00:46:19.220" end="00:46:24.460">Yes, and, no, because what you can do is that on</p>
      <p begin="00:46:24.460" end="00:46:28.220">...actually is a default type of application that exist there and you could target</p>
      <p begin="00:46:28.220" end="00:46:33.190">...default application if you want to you even using.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:33.190" end="00:46:38.160">what about close...closed captioning handling on the on the on this website</p>
      <p begin="00:46:38.160" end="00:46:43.960">do we need to do anything for closed-captioned are depends...which type of ...which type of device really,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:43.960" end="00:46:48.410">yeah, okay, so, if you need to incremental truncation on the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:48.410" end="00:46:52.880">streams so...hundred from sander...or is it</p>
      <p begin="00:46:52.880" end="00:47:00.160">again the device specific so what happens with authentication on a stream is that?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:00.160" end="00:47:04.440">It depends on the technology but let me go into the into detail on that a little bit more</p>
      <p begin="00:47:04.440" end="00:47:08.120">...you do element casting...casting source.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:08.120" end="00:47:10.950">What we really filtered the list down to</p>
      <p begin="00:47:10.950" end="00:47:15.600">is any of the devices that support the content protection you're using?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:15.600" end="00:47:20.620">...so that's what the mediaelement casting and,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:20.620" end="00:47:24.710">then withdial you really are in control yourself it really is the app</p>
      <p begin="00:47:24.710" end="00:47:27.890">...to determine whether the content is a lot of the play or not and</p>
      <p begin="00:47:27.890" end="00:47:32.950">it is very similar if you use the projection manager api...because what you're really doing is that your</p>
      <p begin="00:47:32.950" end="00:47:38.700">...video locally so, yes, you have to do...with the production manager api</p>
      <p begin="00:47:38.700" end="00:47:45.140">is but it shouldn't be a lot of work...should be able to easily...that yourself.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:45.140" end="00:47:47.420">Hi, the dial stuff can I use that</p>
      <p begin="00:47:47.420" end="00:47:52.930">just appear to apps together on two different machines or is it only for video so,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:52.930" end="00:47:55.680">the question is a dial-up only for video or can I just...to</p>
      <p begin="00:47:55.680" end="00:48:03.180">...applications on different devices it really is not restricted to media ...it is?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:03.180" end="00:48:07.310">What oftentimes is the case the dial service that is running</p>
      <p begin="00:48:07.310" end="00:48:12.660">...most of time only implemented on a media receiver types of devices like xbox like chrome</p>

      <p begin="00:48:15.490" end="00:48:18.540">The second question is can windows ten act as a</p>
