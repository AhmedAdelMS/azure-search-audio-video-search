      <p begin="00:01:29.840" end="00:01:35.740">and ten minutes obviously quit that and work for microsoft now and,...to say</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.740" end="00:01:42.350">I quite like blueberry pancakes anymore but,...right into...so ice-breaker so,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.350" end="00:01:44.710">what is microsoft asher marketplace a lot of you might think,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.710" end="00:01:49.070">you know, the...is...there's a mobile store a windows store and agile</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.070" end="00:01:54.510">marketplace...confusing we're doing a big effort to make a lot of consolidation of what this</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.510" end="00:01:57.950">is microsoft as a marketplace is an online marketplace</p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.950" end="00:02:03.210">to discover the purchase provision integrated services and applications that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.210" end="00:02:07.130">...extend cashmere?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.130" end="00:02:10.520">So, it's an ecosystem.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:10.520" end="00:02:12.940">Why using microsoft measure marketplace</p>
      <p begin="00:02:12.940" end="00:02:18.000">it's a growing ecosystem we have I as we have paths we...the first</p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:23.640">price services third-party services we're trying to constantly fill gaps...trying to figure out from</p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.640" end="00:02:27.950">...what kind of services they actually want to build on to create really awesome solutions</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.950" end="00:02:32.260">for customers or even internally with their own companies?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.260" end="00:02:36.390">It's a one-stop-shop so as I said before a lot of folks novel many</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.390" end="00:02:40.270">storefronts fragile...to consolidate all that make everything go through</p>
      <p begin="00:02:40.270" end="00:02:45.210">one-point-one point of contact one storefront so you're not going to multiple stores</p>
      <p begin="00:02:45.210" end="00:02:51.460">...certain things and everything feels familiar inconsistent.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:51.460" end="00:02:53.810">Then we also are focusing a lot on</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.810" end="00:02:58.190">...you why and making the back and actually integrate easily so when you purchases services was</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.190" end="00:03:02.590">first party third-party of across a stack they'll integrate very easily together</p>
      <p begin="00:03:02.590" end="00:03:09.060">and seamlessly a lot of corners take the initiative to make it so it's plug-and-play ready.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.060" end="00:03:14.190">And, then finally there's one...address subscription has one bill you're going to our marketplace</p>
      <p begin="00:03:14.190" end="00:03:16.500">you can purchase any service you want without one you don't have to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:16.500" end="00:03:23.910">re-enter credit cards you don't have to have anything other than worrying about what that services that you want to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23.910" end="00:03:27.270">Another point...using marketplaces we have a global reach so right now and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.270" end="00:03:31.580">...in eighty-six countries that means we can sell to a six different countries</p>
      <p begin="00:03:31.580" end="00:03:36.580">and see there's a long list of them here potentially are not from united states you might</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.580" end="00:03:40.060">...country on here and this is growing...both from a cell...and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:40.060" end="00:03:41.730">...from perspective</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.730" end="00:03:47.610">so we can sell to certain regions and we can sell your products from certain regions.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47.610" end="00:03:51.430">But, the point here is that we have a very large global outreach so getting your</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.430" end="00:03:58.950">services in here is really great for marketing and for your global marketplace?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:58.950" end="00:04:02.010">So, how does...up microsoft as...was work?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02.010" end="00:04:06.690">Well, first we have free tears and free trials that means you get the try things before you buy them</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.690" end="00:04:11.330">that's great there's no commitment is very flexible subscription options so</p>
      <p begin="00:04:11.330" end="00:04:15.250">...you can try you pretty much pay for you use or some partners even allow you to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:15.250" end="00:04:18.830">...their service for free and use it for a month so,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.830" end="00:04:23.980">that there are moves a lot of friction...to understand how powerful the ecosystem is in the services within</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.980" end="00:04:28.770">...microsoft measure and again...on...on this one...payment instrument</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.770" end="00:04:33.690">measure so makes it very seamless you really have to worry about just the core competency which is</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33.690" end="00:04:38.650">finding the service building with the service and creating solutions for your customers.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.650" end="00:04:43.630">And, then there's large work force behind you microsoft provides all of building assistance as well as microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:04:43.630" end="00:04:48.990">and our partners are providers provide a product support.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:48.990" end="00:04:50.750">What's for sale.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:50.750" end="00:04:55.420">Have lots of things for...and this is also growing...part of growing ecosystem web analytics</p>
      <p begin="00:04:55.420" end="00:04:59.170">monitoring where development tools data in storage</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.170" end="00:05:03.170">...back-up media web list goes on</p>
      <p begin="00:05:03.170" end="00:05:07.370">...identity access management the idea is that we sell these tools</p>
      <p begin="00:05:07.370" end="00:05:10.450">via different kind of deploy mechanisms summer vietnam's</p>
      <p begin="00:05:10.450" end="00:05:15.440">summer web services summer mobile it's across many platforms</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:19.920">...in many languages we try to be platform agnostic so that we can</p>
      <p begin="00:05:19.920" end="00:05:25.550">sport all customers and rand-r partners?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:25.550" end="00:05:29.790">Now the part that is...be most of this demo is going to be a show-and-tell so</p>

      <p begin="00:05:48.540" end="00:05:52.400">...going to add a leader board to it so that way you can actually play the game over and over again</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52.400" end="00:05:56.690">aggregate your score as well as rank yourself across other players in the system.</p>

      <p begin="00:06:31.060" end="00:06:36.130">And, before...the demo I'm going to show you the microsoft measure portal.</p>

      <p begin="00:15:32.190" end="00:15:37.920">...sorry about that means zoom in you can see we have some functions.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:42.830">When the home pages loaded we call this change image function which is javascript and we also have a handle</p>
      <p begin="00:15:42.830" end="00:15:45.910">create these both get call?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:45.910" end="00:15:47.980">So, I'm going to go into this.</p>

      <p begin="00:15:56.780" end="00:16:01.650">So, here's a handle creative and what the hell creative and does it every time a user creates</p>
      <p begin="00:16:01.650" end="00:16:06.570">a new game and they click on a card...has to do something so it's going to flip so this functional</p>
      <p begin="00:16:06.570" end="00:16:11.080">...the cards there's two cards flip spell-check if there's a match?</p>

      <p begin="00:16:14.010" end="00:16:19.530">cards back there's not a match it flips them back and, that's just really the function that does the clicking and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:19.530" end="00:16:23.990">accounting of if you've successfully...completed the game or not.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:23.990" end="00:16:30.240">When you come down here you can see there's a flip image function really all does just foot images back and forth?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:30.240" end="00:16:34.330">And, there's a change image so this is the partner game where.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:34.330" end="00:16:38.130">We actually will take images and svqs randomized them so that</p>
      <p begin="00:16:38.130" end="00:16:43.360">when you play new game they're not the same spot every time so we need to be able to changes images...change</p>
      <p begin="00:16:43.360" end="00:16:47.980">...call we actually called get images and right now and get images we have all of images stored in the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:47.980" end="00:16:52.920">sql client which I've installed already and you can see in my web dot com fake on</p>
      <p begin="00:16:52.920" end="00:16:59.320">pointing to it so that's the game host things that...semi connections string which is a</p>
      <p begin="00:16:59.320" end="00:17:04.130">sql client and this information that you get when you deploy that vm so...actually all my vm</p>
      <p begin="00:17:04.130" end="00:17:08.090">...preloaded the...with some basic images.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:08.090" end="00:17:10.710">And, this is the web...</p>
      <p begin="00:17:10.710" end="00:17:15.590">So, this will actually go through and I'll say is our topic...later we'll have a topic right now is just</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.590" end="00:17:22.580">the basic game we're actually going to a post call...this is...comes...aspect of it.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:22.580" end="00:17:26.130">Handling images actually put those images in the array that they're going to be when</p>
      <p begin="00:17:26.130" end="00:17:30.640">they flip over and then the match the pattern build</p>
      <p begin="00:17:30.640" end="00:17:34.600">...function that randomly chooses index zeroed matches index three and every time you</p>
      <p begin="00:17:34.600" end="00:17:38.930">play game it rearranges indexes so it's a random game to add challenging make</p>
      <p begin="00:17:38.930" end="00:17:42.440">...challenging there's a sleep for how long you wait before</p>
      <p begin="00:17:42.440" end="00:17:48.200">you flip there's some reset game functions and everything else and here's kind of just...</p>
      <p begin="00:17:48.200" end="00:17:52.430">So,...coming back to these ones quite frequently as we've all this game.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:52.430" end="00:17:56.630">Right now it's going...the get image because that's actually dealing with...so the image</p>
      <p begin="00:17:56.630" end="00:18:00.900">...if you come into it and...again.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:00.900" end="00:18:05.750">You can see I have for the default game I've hard coded some text.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:05.750" end="00:18:11.400">So, google xbox hello goodbye and their mapped to the actual images for each one of these</p>
      <p begin="00:18:11.400" end="00:18:14.810">autumn so this is a six card game when they flip you get taxed, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:14.810" end="00:18:17.560">when you can image you want to matches to?</p>
      <p begin="00:18:17.560" end="00:18:20.680">So, we are using sequels...vn which has the same images if the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:20.680" end="00:18:26.860">connection that fails we fail back to these ones here's our cloud storage accounts on just initiating a</p>
      <p begin="00:18:26.860" end="00:18:30.740">blob storage this is actually for chat later when we implement that.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:30.740" end="00:18:34.280">...are dictionary the holds all the images for the game</p>
      <p begin="00:18:34.280" end="00:18:37.840">...sql so they're actually key value...</p>
      <p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:42.310">And, then here's the actual message that is on our api site that is get image</p>
      <p begin="00:18:43.360" end="00:18:47.820">That does is it passes in a content body from http message</p>
      <p begin="00:18:47.820" end="00:18:51.920">...content body will have something...we empty so the first function says is an</p>
      <p begin="00:18:51.920" end="00:18:56.740">empty yes it will be for the basic game because of no topics their soon will implement topics</p>
      <p begin="00:18:56.740" end="00:19:01.530">no actually a topic that we're...actually parse over and actually use...being api...you get</p>
      <p begin="00:19:02.670" end="00:19:07.110">...skip over that there's an if statement...through and says okay did the</p>
      <p begin="00:19:07.110" end="00:19:11.050">...connection fail more or less if it did we're going to actually just choose</p>
      <p begin="00:19:11.050" end="00:19:17.990">these default images and mappings up here if it didn't we're going to use.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:17.990" end="00:19:22.310">On our image details which is actually are dictionary that stored</p>
      <p begin="00:19:22.310" end="00:19:26.960">and refers to the...client on...in...</p>
      <p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:31.960">You can see the dictionary we'll use that later for making more difficult...actually going to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:31.960" end="00:19:36.000">...things in the dictionary based someone people search for a topic.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:42.350">Here's parse build that we do international chat and then you see there's some helper functions in here.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:42.350" end="00:19:46.660">So, we've kind of walk through a large part this now we gotta get to the actual model</p>
      <p begin="00:19:46.660" end="00:19:51.660">the model and here is going to be right here the image monitor zoom</p>
      <p begin="00:19:51.660" end="00:19:56.370">and again you can see we have a db context...accessory...db for the</p>
      <p begin="00:19:56.370" end="00:20:00.730">...string you can see here I also refer to in the web dot com vague and they're also gives us our</p>
      <p begin="00:20:00.730" end="00:20:03.940">...our...of this table you see we're going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:20:03.940" end="00:20:08.060">calling image details and rand-r key is going to be based on the text.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:08.060" end="00:20:10.620">We have a class which defines with those image details</p>
      <p begin="00:20:10.620" end="00:20:16.870">are another obvious things like what the images with the text is the image source like</p>
      <p begin="00:20:16.870" end="00:20:20.420">...source the text location in the database so on so forth</p>
      <p begin="00:20:20.420" end="00:20:26.970">...pretty obvious what's going on there so I think I've described everything</p>
      <p begin="00:20:26.970" end="00:20:32.330">there is javascript file which I went through there's accounts...home controller so</p>
      <p begin="00:20:32.330" end="00:20:36.950">...where you go to actually login on the website so we won't do that yet because that's authenticated you</p>
      <p begin="00:20:37.970" end="00:20:43.780">controller is one that actually takes in all the calls from the home page.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:43.780" end="00:20:56.170">So, you can see that there's.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:56.170" end="00:20:57.300">Yes, so, this first...</p>
      <p begin="00:20:57.300" end="00:21:02.300">dom actually going to be building an application and evolve into a more complex applications we</p>
      <p begin="00:21:02.300" end="00:21:06.830">multi-user and I can take that application and actually build a resource provider</p>
      <p begin="00:21:06.830" end="00:21:11.430">and sell in address store and I'll show you that whole process.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:11.430" end="00:21:15.700">Yeah, so, there's a lot of lead up I'm trying to make it more fun and more realistic this</p>
      <p begin="00:21:15.700" end="00:21:19.310">to show that you can actually use the marketplace itself to</p>
      <p begin="00:21:19.310" end="00:21:24.250">take tons of services all...amusing about eight different services building a web application that's just fun for</p>
      <p begin="00:21:24.250" end="00:21:28.530">anyone to play and then I'm going to provision user counts for people to come in log into play</p>
      <p begin="00:21:28.530" end="00:21:36.150">this game that's kind of the story so that's kind of a nugget first there so thanks for the question.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:36.150" end="00:21:36.650">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:39.180">So, why do we build this puppy?</p>

      <p begin="00:28:30.060" end="00:28:32.370">Scoreboard similar to what we have for the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:32.370" end="00:28:38.610">image monitor we have a scoreboard we have a db context.</p>

      <p begin="00:28:54.100" end="00:28:57.130">...right there and add thatwe need to set the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:57.130" end="00:29:05.670">...contacts in that controllers well or not model and...is...</p>
      <p begin="00:29:05.670" end="00:29:08.960">So, the top we connector are sequel dvd we're going to store the scores</p>
      <p begin="00:29:08.960" end="00:29:12.770">there as well as organist or the image details and scoreboard there and</p>

      <p begin="00:29:37.720" end="00:29:41.640">I'm going to build this and...so again I'm just...to local host all deploy the last one on</p>
      <p begin="00:29:41.640" end="00:29:45.060">...on actual websites over can play.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:45.060" end="00:29:48.270">And, what's going to do is...about your noticeable asked me to authenticate who I</p>
      <p begin="00:29:48.270" end="00:29:53.230">am I'm already I already have test...in the system and I've been playing with this for the past few days so I'm in</p>

      <p begin="00:30:23.010" end="00:30:28.060">And, then once a slowed...hello my name's my username has the game again and there's a</p>
      <p begin="00:30:28.060" end="00:30:30.020">leader on the right.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:30.020" end="00:30:34.760">Sometimes it doesn't work perfectly first-time so I have to refresh</p>
      <p begin="00:30:34.760" end="00:30:39.020">every go so it's sort of it finally you can see I'm in the first rank with three</p>
      <p begin="00:30:39.020" end="00:30:43.700">...nine points and everyone below me is the leader board so when I go to</p>

      <p begin="00:30:57.190" end="00:30:59.070">So, that...doo-doo posts the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:59.070" end="00:31:05.950">game flips over the scoreboard will actually updates hopefully.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:05.950" end="00:31:10.660">If not you can see my score data increase no didn't...</p>

      <p begin="01:00:10.900" end="01:00:25.050">there's all the functions for provisioning the provisioning and managing...service zoom in.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:25.050" end="01:00:31.010">Rodeo you beer perfect so, you can see that I have.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:31.010" end="01:00:37.240">Marketplace request...I'm provision resourcewhich will actually go through and I'll have a way for</p>

      <p begin="01:00:38.930" end="01:00:42.840">Keys for folks such as an api key here this is set up for like a storage</p>
      <p begin="01:00:42.840" end="01:00:43.340">structure.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:44.780" end="01:00:48.640">That has service properties you can see their specific ports are endpoints on replace</p>
      <p begin="01:00:48.640" end="01:00:50.260">...this stuff.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:50.260" end="01:00:54.680">...you come down to the provisions is actually remove assist a user from the system.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:54.680" end="01:00:58.590">...resource so anything you want...service like a status</p>
      <p begin="01:00:58.590" end="01:01:03.110">and api key or if you want to do something related to that service that specific that service you do</p>
      <p begin="01:01:03.110" end="01:01:08.140">through that function this all communicates with our back-end and your service.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:08.140" end="01:01:13.020">You can regenerate all your keys sort of say you have a password and...breached you</p>
      <p begin="01:01:13.020" end="01:01:18.730">can reset it get communication preferences this is something so you can communicate you</p>

      <p begin="01:01:27.970" end="01:01:31.610">updating this communication preferences and list goes on...for this demo</p>
      <p begin="01:01:31.610" end="01:01:34.900">...update the provisioning.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:34.900" end="01:01:37.040">The provisioning everyone gets to</p>
      <p begin="01:01:37.040" end="01:01:41.260">...their user management is however they</p>
      <p begin="01:01:41.260" end="01:01:44.100">...you...again so...provision someone</p>
      <p begin="01:01:44.100" end="01:01:48.640">...a database...should give them the key see of the mappings that way you can find them</p>
      <p begin="01:01:48.640" end="01:01:55.750">...delete if you want you can update them...sequel and I'm actually in a store that using hash.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:56.800" end="01:01:59.520">This is also...drive you to I don't recommend you do this</p>
      <p begin="01:01:59.520" end="01:02:07.990">...require much more secure way to do it...by a different way that you want to do it.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:07.990" end="01:02:12.860">Well, the sequel connection here which is great.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:12.860" end="01:02:13.580">And, then.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:14.670" end="01:02:19.990">Within the actual provisioning function on a provision a user.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:19.990" end="01:02:23.630">Put the current provision users you can see here I'm opening the...connection</p>
      <p begin="01:02:23.630" end="01:02:29.080">...them...into a time stamp to make it is unique as possible I'm doing it at</p>
      <p begin="01:02:29.080" end="01:02:34.190">hatcher marketplace dot com so this is actually...use assign into the memory game website they're going to be</p>
      <p begin="01:02:34.190" end="01:02:38.160">they're...is password so it's nothing secure for now I'm going to store that using</p>
      <p begin="01:02:38.160" end="01:02:46.950">hash password function that on from the next...rate now.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:46.950" end="01:02:51.330">So, I'll actually open up the connection are right there username and password and</p>
      <p begin="01:02:51.330" end="01:02:55.770">dragging stuff into the sequel connection now close an update the dictionary</p>
      <p begin="01:02:55.770" end="01:03:00.390">and then I will show them that I'm going to give them their keys once they.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:00.390" end="01:03:02.880">...added the system.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:02.880" end="01:03:04.420">You see here.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:04.420" end="01:03:11.190">I'm going to replace the storage related information and replace it with us.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:11.190" end="01:03:13.760">The username password...website.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:13.760" end="01:03:19.370">The game.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:19.370" end="01:03:23.750">So, now they have a username a password and a link when they go into their manager for the resource of</p>
      <p begin="01:03:23.750" end="01:03:29.340">...they can click on the keys they'll see their username or password in the key.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:29.340" end="01:03:33.450">And, for the provisioning I really do the complete opposite of all that I open up</p>
      <p begin="01:03:33.450" end="01:03:41.980">the sequel database and I delete the user and then I...</p>
      <p begin="01:03:41.980" end="01:03:43.850">I will build this.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:43.850" end="01:03:47.610">Get all...is doing is just database connections and adding and using users</p>
      <p begin="01:03:47.610" end="01:03:51.640">so it's pretty simple so, somewhere in here when you're doing a provisioning</p>
      <p begin="01:03:51.640" end="01:03:53.760">...calling your api is on your</p>
      <p begin="01:03:53.760" end="01:03:58.170">service actual revision people or to give them access keys and things like that.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:58.170" end="01:04:03.400">So, that builds and I will deploy this.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:03.400" end="01:04:13.860">Actually I want to locally I can actually put to a website.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:13.860" end="01:04:18.360">Now...hoses rp...one to many places around the world depending on how you do your traffic management or</p>
      <p begin="01:04:18.360" end="01:04:24.100">...balancing what happens we have ...resource manager which is like the god</p>
      <p begin="01:04:24.100" end="01:04:28.990">resource provider it does all provision someone purchases something in knows that your resource provider</p>
      <p begin="01:04:28.990" end="01:04:33.790">exists errol make calls to your resource providers authenticated calls and then from here this is how it</p>
      <p begin="01:04:33.790" end="01:04:36.800">plugs into your so we have a threat model which is only one entry point</p>
      <p begin="01:04:36.800" end="01:04:42.860">that's arm and all the communication through that through this rp?</p>
      <p begin="01:04:42.860" end="01:04:44.390">And, so.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:44.390" end="01:04:47.930">I can actually deploy this.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:47.930" end="01:04:54.920">...I publish...be at a...overtime bummer.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:54.920" end="01:04:58.300">...to new website was called.</p>

      <p begin="01:05:12.210" end="01:05:16.100">The publishing poorly you can go to publish neck and it pushes staging.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:17.180" end="01:05:21.080">This allows me to set the sub ideas are the people who can actually test in</p>
      <p begin="01:05:21.080" end="01:05:24.870">ui so we actually will vet who they are and only services for those testers.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:25.930" end="01:05:41.200">Already added that lists.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:41.200" end="01:05:56.020">Okay, and, I'm going to log...</p>
      <p begin="01:05:56.020" end="01:05:58.150">So, we are staging portal.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:58.150" end="01:06:02.590">Looks and feels the same way with some slight differences.</p>
      <p begin="01:06:02.590" end="01:06:07.350">You can see that the are...was provision I believe.</p>
