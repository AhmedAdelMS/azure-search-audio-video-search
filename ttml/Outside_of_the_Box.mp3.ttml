      <p begin="00:00:02.660" end="00:00:06.830">...we're bringing somebody out from under hiding and letting him</p>
      <p begin="00:00:06.830" end="00:00:11.180">talked publicly he's been missing in action for five years.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.180" end="00:00:15.110">This is my friend...box distinguish distinguished engineer</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.110" end="00:00:20.520">at microsoft hello dawn moi I'm...you it's</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:26.100">...nice to see you again after five years it's fantastic...well thank you thanks so I just</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.100" end="00:00:31.930">...start this by having you explain where the heck of you...five yearsso,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.930" end="00:00:36.000">I've...busily products okay I just it's funny</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.000" end="00:00:39.150">I've given a couple toxin last month and,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.150" end="00:00:42.060">I was up on stage in china and I realized with</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.060" end="00:00:47.840">...I've done this like five years, yeah, so, I've been pretty busy I would say</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.840" end="00:00:52.830">...the last five years...an interesting journeyI went to work xbox.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.830" end="00:00:58.310">Come in two thousand and beginning to...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.310" end="00:01:03.630">at the time...very of focus on building xbox one right so,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.630" end="00:01:06.570">it was a very secret...there...no public,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.570" end="00:01:11.540">you know, engagement whatsoever actually want to...a couple talks but they were in the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.540" end="00:01:14.990">...okay so, we should xbox one and,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.990" end="00:01:20.580">I went to go work it was jeep on the broader os and, you know, kind of,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:20.580" end="00:01:24.150">you know, we work on the windows ten thing finally</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.150" end="00:01:27.750">...story this calendar year and that's what kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.750" end="00:01:32.130">...yep...I have to...little story because my job is</p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:37.030">I'm a reporter...done went to the xbox team I knew you went to the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:37.030" end="00:01:42.030">xbox team and a lot of us who are watching microsoft...the...speculating what</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.030" end="00:01:46.590">...doing on the xbox team like here's a guy who's been working on things like</p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.590" end="00:01:51.190">declarative programming languages and all that kinda stuff and suddenly he's on that,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.340" end="00:01:57.530">yeah, it was definitely a bit of a non secular you know,...was on this project called oslo</p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.530" end="00:02:03.740">positive wound down and I kind of...the earth microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.740" end="00:02:08.480">...next...your for rousing really and raised we had this project called</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.480" end="00:02:11.850">...which is a tv...became part of xbox.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.850" end="00:02:15.780">...then we...up, you know, doing smart last-minute xbox one and,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.780" end="00:02:20.070">it was really just, you know, it was about, you know, meeting ray ozzie was a big deal</p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.070" end="00:02:24.710">any walter was great so there...these people want to work with...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:24.710" end="00:02:31.450">I follow the people as opposed to what part of the way I found out what you're doing is I looked up your linkedin</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.680" end="00:02:38.010">And, there were some things on there that was good it was helpful I but now you have a title besides</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.010" end="00:02:42.560">distinguished engineer that's kind of complex...silicon right and, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:45.850">so, graphics pptx...so</p>
      <p begin="00:02:45.850" end="00:02:51.830">...xbox one I was the deb manager for the os platform so we do everything from</p>
      <p begin="00:02:51.830" end="00:02:56.700">colonel silicon graphics media everything and, then, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.700" end="00:03:03.180">when we kind of change the way we're building operating systems I wound up actually I was</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.180" end="00:03:07.440">happy to become the guy who...in charge of all of the silicon graphics and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:11.350">media for all products so what does that mean actually what do you do in</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.350" end="00:03:16.900">...and that rollers...what mighty does iswe deliver the graphics...I direct</p>
      <p begin="00:03:16.900" end="00:03:21.760">...request twelve is obviously big initiative price we deliver that on all the products</p>
      <p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:25.070">...we do that on...on</p>
      <p begin="00:03:25.070" end="00:03:29.210">phones on xbox on poland's on t skews on</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29.210" end="00:03:34.430">...we also the media stacks all the audio basically if you can see it or hear it</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.430" end="00:03:39.430">someone of my team made it happen...because all the all of the visual...audio up</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.430" end="00:03:44.300">on the box go through my team and then all just the...silicon stuff whenever,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.300" end="00:03:48.800">you know, intel qualcomm or silicon vendor has new piece of silicon someone's got to do</p>
      <p begin="00:03:48.800" end="00:03:53.400">...bring up right and that's...does...kind of like a generalization what we did</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.400" end="00:03:58.440">an xbox we had exactly one piece of silicon exactly one product we...bill this</p>
      <p begin="00:03:58.440" end="00:04:02.760">one this projects actually much more it much more complex simply because we're bouncing</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02.760" end="00:04:08.560">multiple silicon bring...multiple prores...so, that's what that's...</p>
      <p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:13.520">How much you involved and what we've heard a lot here at buildabout which is universal</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.520" end="00:04:16.880">...platform...how does that play in with what you guys</p>
      <p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:22.560">well so it's a huge part of my job one of the things I'm responsible for</p>
      <p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:27.360">...of driving the component is a shun and structuring the operating system to make sure we can satisfy</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:31.220">all these products if you look at how we built windows</p>
      <p begin="00:04:31.220" end="00:04:35.530">phony and xbox one when we originally built them you had</p>
      <p begin="00:04:35.530" end="00:04:40.060">a different groups doing very isolated partitioning of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:40.060" end="00:04:44.850">the operating system so if you look at the subset of windows the chips and windows phone...you'll get the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:44.850" end="00:04:49.450">subset of windows chips on xbox one there's a lot of overlap but there's a lot of,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.450" end="00:04:53.770">you know, somewhat different decisions and one of the things, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53.770" end="00:04:58.010">I wanted to do...we set up...was I wanted to make sure that we could do</p>
      <p begin="00:04:58.010" end="00:05:02.500">...structured way in a way that would help everybody right because it is we saw things like,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:02.500" end="00:05:07.290">you know, athens which is the ot addition if we'll get...you know, we were about to,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:07.290" end="00:05:11.010">you know, explode the combinatorially of the ways we combine,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.010" end="00:05:16.600">... the windows code base so yeah, so, what we do is we basically, you know, at</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.600" end="00:05:21.180">the beginning of the project you can help...all the cards on the table to all the product where to go build</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.180" end="00:05:26.310">...kind of figure out how to strata by the os in such a way that we would have a predictable it's</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.310" end="00:05:30.950">a platform...span all of these devices here, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:30.950" end="00:05:34.690">here at this conference one of the biggest announcements was around ios</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.690" end="00:05:37.920">and android developers and how microsoft's trying to bring...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:37.920" end="00:05:43.190">the platform yes how is that going to change what constitutes the common core</p>
      <p begin="00:05:43.190" end="00:05:48.680">...the comment underlying platform is a committing generalI don't I don't know that has</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.680" end="00:05:53.600">...a deep impact on the...platform in the core platform...to go</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:58.520">...fact we're able to go run android...ios code is a virtue of the fact</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58.520" end="00:06:02.570">...platforms pretty general-purpose right so I don't know that, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:02.570" end="00:06:07.350">there's a lot of deep changes were making the os that the...everyone</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.350" end="00:06:12.050">else we're absolutely committed to go to make those code...worthwhile on windows</p>
      <p begin="00:06:12.050" end="00:06:19.960">I think in terms of the general way the system works, you know,...our apply?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:19.960" end="00:06:22.740">I wish we had a surface hub right here because remember</p>
      <p begin="00:06:22.740" end="00:06:28.800">...used...always draw these amazing architectural diagrams to explain things and, I am</p>
      <p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:33.750">...still get my head around the idea of with this common core and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:33.750" end="00:06:38.810">common store and all of where...these new layers look like right so I know there's</p>
      <p begin="00:06:38.810" end="00:06:43.580">...universal platform...platform layer is also universal driver framework</p>
      <p begin="00:06:43.580" end="00:06:50.110">freight where...also...help fundamentally we have a bunch of operating system code</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.110" end="00:06:55.480">...we...right and it has a surface area that...iso...which is the app platform</p>
      <p begin="00:06:55.480" end="00:07:00.200">right it has the surface area that's exposed to I interviews and silicon vendors which is the driver</p>
      <p begin="00:07:00.200" end="00:07:05.000">...device platform it's the same product yet it's all we have two different platforms and we have</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.000" end="00:07:08.380">windows in many ways windows...of what windows and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:08.380" end="00:07:14.320">has been about is coming up with a way to think about our code base of product</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.320" end="00:07:17.470">Such that we have a consistent platform for...for app developers</p>
      <p begin="00:07:17.470" end="00:07:21.390">regain developer yet and consistent platform for device makers...</p>
      <p begin="00:07:22.550" end="00:07:28.280">And, silicon vendors so it's really a manifestation about we were</p>
      <p begin="00:07:28.280" end="00:07:31.030">constructing operating system.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:31.030" end="00:07:36.050">...that helps...does it does...kind of thinking back and, showing my age here a</p>
      <p begin="00:07:36.050" end="00:07:41.460">little on this but I remember when you guys are building windows seven and the whole idea about</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.460" end="00:07:47.010">...and how you guys return at de-couple things are all kind of...windows and,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:47.010" end="00:07:52.080">make it kind of make more sense right separate things out you could basically set up for</p>
      <p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:57.210">what you're doing now I'm curious how you feel that's involved and honest</p>
      <p begin="00:07:57.210" end="00:08:02.190">I would say windows...is the next natural step in the evolution like if you</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02.190" end="00:08:06.580">win-win was ages ago what's right and it was the first stab I think we took</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.580" end="00:08:11.100">a kind of strata find the operating system and, coming up with more discipline about dependency management</p>
      <p begin="00:08:11.100" end="00:08:15.410">...layering write each iteration we've done more of that certainly</p>
      <p begin="00:08:15.410" end="00:08:19.890">...we build xbox one right we benefited from a lot of the evolution that work which</p>
      <p begin="00:08:19.890" end="00:08:24.780">...time it was called core system right and, we certainly built on top of that</p>
      <p begin="00:08:24.780" end="00:08:28.930">...came up with our own partitioning as did the phones and really if I look at windows</p>
      <p begin="00:08:28.930" end="00:08:34.190">ten it's the generalization of that next...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.190" end="00:08:39.890">right that actually is a layering that makes sense for all of these points...a single way to go</p>
      <p begin="00:08:39.890" end="00:08:47.790">...the runs on all of these devices...love to talk about so it it's a natural evolution?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:47.790" end="00:08:51.810">...with xbox one though at some point you're going to bring when windows tend</p>
      <p begin="00:08:51.810" end="00:08:56.560">to that platform of someway right you say anything about that right now</p>
      <p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:08:59.920">...to be clear...I think we've been pretty open about it we run</p>
      <p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:03.700">...windows...right so if you're playing, you know, your xbox one there's</p>
      <p begin="00:09:03.700" end="00:09:08.230">a copy windows in fact we run three operating systems on that box but the one that, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.230" end="00:09:13.920">kind of people focus on is the system os was where the shell runs through all the optron</p>
      <p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:18.170">...where a lot of system services run that is based on a snapple windows...that we</p>
      <p begin="00:09:18.170" end="00:09:23.290">took back in two thousand twelve right and when the process of course</p>
      <p begin="00:09:23.290" end="00:09:27.690">...that code base into windows...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:27.690" end="00:09:29.720">we're making good progress on it and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:29.720" end="00:09:35.540">it's very promising...excited and the promise of being able to do it is</p>
      <p begin="00:09:35.540" end="00:09:38.860">we'll have the same code base the same api surface</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.860" end="00:09:46.710">...same behavior across xbox as well as you so isn't oversimplified to</p>
      <p begin="00:09:46.710" end="00:09:49.540">There might be a case where somebody wants to run</p>
      <p begin="00:09:49.540" end="00:09:53.140">and enterprise app on xbox and they would do it I mean</p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.140" end="00:09:57.570">another things you could do versus what makes sense right well I mean it it's</p>
      <p begin="00:09:57.570" end="00:10:02.650">a great question if we're talking about existing enterprise al-zoubi road...forms are divinity</p>
      <p begin="00:10:02.650" end="00:10:08.970">...any the,... technologies will know for enterprise on the answer is that's</p>
      <p begin="00:10:08.970" end="00:10:15.530">Like...get when we talk about strata for the operating system what we did for windows</p>
      <p begin="00:10:15.530" end="00:10:21.000">ten we identify the line of shared functionality...components...and</p>
      <p begin="00:10:21.000" end="00:10:25.920">...that...sense on every single device right and that did not</p>
      <p begin="00:10:25.920" end="00:10:31.980">include all the things it takes to go run enterprise apps write those things like the things it takes</p>
      <p begin="00:10:31.980" end="00:10:35.750">...make wpf...certainly ship on the</p>

      <p begin="00:13:10.310" end="00:13:15.240">a fairly narrow gamer I only play...are the most recent called</p>
      <p begin="00:13:15.240" end="00:13:18.970">...so I'm reasonably good but if you follow me</p>
      <p begin="00:13:18.970" end="00:13:24.290">on xbox live my gamer spores...simply because first-person shooters typically don't reward</p>
      <p begin="00:13:24.290" end="00:13:30.710">lots so my...my reputation is actually greater if you're in called duty...as opposed to</p>

      <p begin="00:13:43.890" end="00:13:50.240">...musician I think you still...right and I was kinda curious if you're going to do something with xbox</p>
      <p begin="00:13:50.240" end="00:13:55.220">music or if you got involved inI had nothing...the...</p>
      <p begin="00:13:56.630" end="00:14:01.470">And, it again it was the...the reason I felons xbox was not because I was a...gamer</p>
      <p begin="00:14:01.470" end="00:14:07.470">...always...to...it was...people right I met people on...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:07.470" end="00:14:12.900">and then you'll once I was in the got it only got better right and,... the experiences I</p>
      <p begin="00:14:12.900" end="00:14:17.760">...xbox...with all these people were so much smarter than me I just learned some</p>
      <p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:23.460">of the caspian that's an interesting point can-you talking all about things that</p>
      <p begin="00:14:23.460" end="00:14:27.450">you learned doing the xbox operating system that you think are very much</p>
      <p begin="00:14:27.450" end="00:14:31.640">applicable to these other platforms like other things xbox team was kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:14:31.640" end="00:14:36.440">pushing the envelope on are doing that is benefitted now like phone in the surface hub</p>
      <p begin="00:14:36.440" end="00:14:41.010">and poland's even that's an interesting question we certainly if I look at the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:41.010" end="00:14:45.970">depends we made an xbox one which, you know, we're watching kind of like bear fruit</p>
      <p begin="00:14:45.970" end="00:14:49.700">...the broader...you know.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:49.700" end="00:14:53.430">Some people know...some people don't xbox one runs three operating system right</p>
      <p begin="00:14:53.430" end="00:14:56.790">...right we basically buddha very minimal</p>
      <p begin="00:14:56.790" end="00:15:01.000">hosed os right which runs the hyper visor and we launched the system all which is where</p>
      <p begin="00:15:01.000" end="00:15:04.520">...apps run and then we have this very tuned partition another</p>
      <p begin="00:15:04.520" end="00:15:09.120">vm we run the games we did that for a variety of reasons</p>
      <p begin="00:15:09.120" end="00:15:11.830">what are the biggest reasons we did was we want to resource</p>
      <p begin="00:15:11.830" end="00:15:15.660">...right because if you look at the consul?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:15.660" end="00:15:20.190">Programming environment right you have this fixed function hardware that lives</p>
      <p begin="00:15:20.190" end="00:15:22.270">for you multiple years.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:22.270" end="00:15:27.190">...and developers are very used to having nothing else happening on the box right like when you</p>
      <p begin="00:15:27.190" end="00:15:32.030">wrote xbox...sixty game it's as if we've effectively reboot the machine right there's not a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:15:32.030" end="00:15:36.530">of other microsoft code running when you're playing...duty under three sixty.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:36.530" end="00:15:41.930">So, we wanted to be able to give that kind of resource isolation guarantees and we look at the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:41.930" end="00:15:46.450">tools...were available to us at the time and that was the most...do a which is basically use</p>
      <p begin="00:15:46.450" end="00:15:51.780">...of ibm to go enforces if we look at things like in directives twelve</p>
      <p begin="00:15:51.780" end="00:15:56.670">vertex well today which is on both xbox one is coming to xbox one incoming to windows</p>
      <p begin="00:15:56.670" end="00:16:02.120">ten-x will ship with windows...you know, those same ideas of, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:02.120" end="00:16:07.400">having dedicated resource allocations that gain can predictably no I need this</p>
      <p begin="00:16:07.400" end="00:16:12.200">page memory it's going-to be there for me no matter what else is happening on the box this is mine and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:12.200" end="00:16:16.570">...stay...those ideas, you know,...kind of starting to see</p>
      <p begin="00:16:16.570" end="00:16:21.370">you become more generalized that's probably the biggest, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:21.370" end="00:16:24.190">thing that happened in xbox...kind of see</p>
      <p begin="00:16:24.190" end="00:16:27.830">...for...I remember when you guys first talked about the architecture</p>
      <p begin="00:16:27.830" end="00:16:33.930">...the xbox one operating system when we started hearing about the virtualization...dave cutlery</p>
      <p begin="00:16:33.930" end="00:16:38.840">been working on that it was suddenly like old waiters three operating systems on here pretty much</p>
      <p begin="00:16:38.840" end="00:16:43.600">for yet I mean that that's not going to be the case another devices</p>
      <p begin="00:16:43.600" end="00:16:50.060">...and load...now that I mean...that we use the verycoarse</p>
      <p begin="00:16:50.060" end="00:16:55.380">grain tool right to enforce the resource boundaries and it was the right thing for the time on that</p>
      <p begin="00:16:55.380" end="00:16:56.710">product?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:56.710" end="00:16:59.880">In general model I think that we</p>
      <p begin="00:16:59.880" end="00:17:05.250">have more knobs in tools we can go deploy using...fourth-graders</p>
      <p begin="00:17:05.250" end="00:17:10.420">...I don't think is the general model right but it was great for xbox game, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:10.420" end="00:17:16.140">I we could not...build the product we not done yet but, I think,... as we go forward,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:16.140" end="00:17:20.970">you know, being able to put more resource isolation in the os probably more promising thing and were singled out</p>
      <p begin="00:17:20.970" end="00:17:22.660">direct as easy</p>
      <p begin="00:17:22.660" end="00:17:27.510">...things are probably changed a lot to from when you started working on xbox to now</p>
      <p begin="00:17:27.510" end="00:17:31.340">...in terms of what microsoft's relationship is with gamers and</p>
      <p begin="00:17:31.340" end="00:17:35.860">game developers especially because I know...of the examples here they talked about a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:35.860" end="00:17:42.490">...was that candy crush sagawas built using this new ios tool...</p>
      <p begin="00:17:42.490" end="00:17:46.070">Just a few years ago you can't even imagine microsoft really having a conversation with</p>
      <p begin="00:17:46.070" end="00:17:49.320">...it's I don't know I could.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:49.320" end="00:17:52.340">Maybe work but I know so,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:52.340" end="00:17:56.360">I...you're doing more around unity and you're doing a lot around bringing</p>
      <p begin="00:17:56.360" end="00:18:01.310">gain developers into the fold what...however they want to come to the...</p>
      <p begin="00:18:01.310" end="00:18:08.010">...it has...change the relationship like microsoft relationship with game developments in your.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:08.010" end="00:18:13.250">It's a great question I think in general people happy to see the things we're doing you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:13.250" end="00:18:16.220">the reaction to us really embracing unity has been really,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:16.220" end="00:18:18.770">really strong the reaction to.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:19.920" end="00:18:23.560">The work we're doing a directs twelve has been really...you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:23.560" end="00:18:26.530">bring xbox live more broadly we're definitely,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:26.530" end="00:18:31.880">you know, especially with this...this...this the windows and release, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:31.880" end="00:18:37.220">we're putting a lot of energy...an effort into making sure that game developers can succeeding can make money or</p>
      <p begin="00:18:37.220" end="00:18:42.460">...right so, you know, I think in general is positive we get feedback</p>
      <p begin="00:18:42.460" end="00:18:46.500">it's great the feedback is not always positive which is great otherwise you'd just be,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:46.500" end="00:18:53.830">you know,...withering would be very active so not I think the...really well what do you think</p>
      <p begin="00:18:53.830" end="00:19:00.240">...my craft...puzzled we did you think...mean I thought about it I found out</p>
      <p begin="00:19:00.240" end="00:19:06.140">about it the same time everyone else...it blew my mind I mean it's fantastic and,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:06.140" end="00:19:08.600">certainly in terms of having an asset</p>
      <p begin="00:19:08.600" end="00:19:17.280">...touches many millions of people's lives it's a fantastic.</p>

      <p begin="00:19:22.430" end="00:19:27.020">in january when I was there for the windows...event and one of the things that gets try was</p>
      <p begin="00:19:28.160" end="00:19:33.910">...presley amount of my...player and you probably fun...but I still fatherly cool</p>
      <p begin="00:19:33.910" end="00:19:39.800">and interesting I think it's going to be interesting to see the whole new audience of</p>
      <p begin="00:19:39.800" end="00:19:44.640">...developers customers that this brings to microsoft and how that fits in with other things</p>

      <p begin="00:19:48.250" end="00:19:51.840">It's...obviously the tech is super advanced and,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:51.840" end="00:19:56.940">the last time I used to which was a while back it's pretty mind-blowing...</p>
      <p begin="00:19:56.940" end="00:20:01.120">It just...values everything else and the fact that you can ready universal windows app</p>
      <p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:05.240">and run-off hollow is fantastic a lot of the technology,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:05.240" end="00:20:11.790">you know, is getting mixed up with the rest of the...actually pretty healthy ...</p>
      <p begin="00:20:11.790" end="00:20:15.490">Okay, what else what else but of course merger the glove will be so much</p>
