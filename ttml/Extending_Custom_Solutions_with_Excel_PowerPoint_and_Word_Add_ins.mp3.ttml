      <p begin="00:03:32.910" end="00:03:36.200">these inefficiencies so productivity</p>

      <p begin="00:04:28.390" end="00:04:31.560">There's one talk a little bit about the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:31.560" end="00:04:36.360">new web audience so you probably heard the rename from apps for</p>
      <p begin="00:04:36.360" end="00:04:40.860">...to the new office audience.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:40.860" end="00:04:45.820">this is something that we are doing to reflect on the history that we have had</p>

      <p begin="00:04:50.380" end="00:04:54.570">were a little bit confuse with the notion of apps and the fact that you have mobile</p>
      <p begin="00:04:54.570" end="00:04:57.260">...web apps and abs inside office</p>
      <p begin="00:04:57.260" end="00:05:00.250">apps so we decided to go with</p>

      <p begin="00:05:06.540" end="00:05:11.110">...so I'd like to ask of these point how</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.110" end="00:05:18.770">many of you I already familiar with apps for office or have developed enough...</p>

      <p begin="00:05:31.790" end="00:05:36.960">the name but eventually everything will be called audience in all the products so,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:36.960" end="00:05:41.210">you see in some the screen shots or even the pros</p>
      <p begin="00:05:41.210" end="00:05:46.200">...terrifies those are what we called office audience and when whenever</p>
      <p begin="00:05:46.200" end="00:05:51.460">we need to distinguish we're going to use the web audience to make sure we're talking about the new type of audience</p>
      <p begin="00:05:51.460" end="00:05:56.430">now let me ask you how many of you have created or have solutions in the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56.430" end="00:06:01.980">...or via seo technology so quite a bit so</p>

      <p begin="00:06:05.540" end="00:06:09.500">...you more about the value of doing these?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.500" end="00:06:10.480">So, let me just</p>
      <p begin="00:06:10.480" end="00:06:16.420">...right into...some...most I want to show you the current state.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.420" end="00:06:21.620">Of office...</p>

      <p begin="00:06:30.620" end="00:06:35.470">In these last few years we've seen a lot of very interesting apps coming up</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.470" end="00:06:40.440">...that allow you to really enhancer productivity so when I show you just a few</p>

      <p begin="00:18:08.420" end="00:18:13.400">Some other person so I'm going to say I'm going I'm going to be the contact for bowed car</p>
      <p begin="00:18:13.400" end="00:18:17.300">...obviously these record use.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:17.300" end="00:18:21.570">Rightnow looks like these in a cp here's the contact I just change</p>
      <p begin="00:18:21.570" end="00:18:25.840">...let me take over like the first three cars I'm going</p>

      <p begin="00:18:30.540" end="00:18:35.540">in this project so when I say let's compare save as you have</p>
      <p begin="00:18:35.540" end="00:18:40.750">seen so this is going to connect to the cpc system and,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:40.750" end="00:18:46.880">check what changes have people made over what changes have made and</p>

      <p begin="00:18:57.400" end="00:19:02.040">There we go so increments...via cpc system it recognizes that I have change three</p>

      <p begin="00:19:05.130" end="00:19:09.210">goals so liquid changes in this case...I say I want to keep all the</p>
      <p begin="00:19:09.210" end="00:19:14.510">excel changes of the cp so I'm dom now I can go back to my is</p>

      <p begin="00:22:58.440" end="00:23:03.240">Close that I'm going to also show you now than we</p>
      <p begin="00:23:03.240" end="00:23:10.640">have the accessible how the you test and develop considering the so</p>
      <p begin="00:23:10.640" end="00:23:16.070">let's just create a very quick project and see how also developer you can put it on the so</p>
      <p begin="00:23:16.070" end="00:23:20.400">that you can for your application make sure that everything's working because even volume...one</p>
      <p begin="00:23:20.400" end="00:23:26.010">code base you still need to make sure that it works across all the different browser versions in the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:26.010" end="00:23:30.990">case of ios you will be working with a safari so this is no different than the web you need to</p>
      <p begin="00:23:30.990" end="00:23:35.970">...your web app multiple browsers is very similar here so it's always a good idea</p>
      <p begin="00:23:35.970" end="00:23:39.140">of to the sign for responsiveness for all these different</p>
      <p begin="00:23:39.140" end="00:23:44.630">...factors but also there's the different browsersto make sure the everything is working</p>
      <p begin="00:23:44.630" end="00:23:50.290">fine so let's just create a very simple app put it on the from a developer</p>
      <p begin="00:23:50.290" end="00:23:55.800">perspective so for that I'm going to use the newvisual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:23:55.800" end="00:24:01.100">all online experience...some of you already saw these</p>
      <p begin="00:24:01.100" end="00:24:04.930">...moines the session for the developer keynote working with outlook</p>
      <p begin="00:24:04.930" end="00:24:10.180">...we also enabled the ability to use nap without requiring</p>
      <p begin="00:24:10.180" end="00:24:13.590">and...sixty-five signing which was a lot of the feedback receive</p>
      <p begin="00:24:13.590" end="00:24:18.570">...was too much of...requirement so we enable the use of map</p>
      <p begin="00:24:18.570" end="00:24:23.120">...with your emissary account so you come here and get started you-can signing with</p>
      <p begin="00:24:23.120" end="00:24:27.260">...your called mail account.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:27.260" end="00:24:33.310">And, this will give you.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:33.310" end="00:24:36.150">...up experience I'm going to create on your project and I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:24:36.150" end="00:24:41.150">going to say I want to create the service realization.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:42.480" end="00:24:47.230">Out in just create so nothing fancy there's</p>
      <p begin="00:24:47.230" end="00:24:51.100">a crawled run it.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:51.100" end="00:25:00.350">So, I have already are working app.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:00.350" end="00:25:02.550">The release.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:02.550" end="00:25:10.260">And, started it's a fully functional.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:10.260" end="00:25:12.750">...your it allows you to visualize in this case</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.750" end="00:25:16.850">...sample data now I'm going to go back to map and,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:16.850" end="00:25:21.800">show you how to moved out from...environment to the odb because I want</p>
      <p begin="00:25:21.800" end="00:25:27.170">this the there so for that I'm going to using this case visual studio but you don't need</p>
      <p begin="00:25:27.170" end="00:25:32.540">visual studio I'm just going to use visual studio for convenience in this case so,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:32.540" end="00:25:35.220">map allows you to download the project to</p>
      <p begin="00:25:35.220" end="00:25:42.130">...studio when...save the file.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:42.130" end="00:25:45.530">And, open it...generates...file that is going to launch</p>
      <p begin="00:25:45.530" end="00:25:53.000">...visual studio automatically with the same project that I just created.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:53.000" end="00:25:55.510">So, I'm going to use visual studio.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:56.630" end="00:26:00.100">To publish these easily to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:00.100" end="00:26:04.570">...website so in order to logged these application on that but I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:04.570" end="00:26:05.110">loaded from</p>
      <p begin="00:26:05.110" end="00:26:10.030">...or to see that it's loading correctly from the right environment so what I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:10.030" end="00:26:17.590">do here is an obviously if I if I run these on the desktop it...wrong.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:17.590" end="00:26:21.560">Just to make sure I'm going to...the...so it's running here on the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:21.560" end="00:26:25.900">desktop using visual studio and it's working world so</p>
      <p begin="00:26:25.900" end="00:26:28.850">...going to stop that.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.850" end="00:26:34.560">And, now what I'm going to do is going to polish these.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:34.560" end="00:26:38.260">Rightly publish I'm going to create a new publishing profile</p>
      <p begin="00:26:38.260" end="00:26:41.390">...it them all.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:41.390" end="00:26:43.450">And, I'm going to...so I</p>
      <p begin="00:26:43.450" end="00:26:48.320">want to show you some of the nice features of visual studio you already have a measure</p>
      <p begin="00:26:48.320" end="00:26:53.910">...with your imis...or...account you can chrome directly to the profile</p>

      <p begin="00:27:22.070" end="00:27:28.390">Once it's...it should launch a browser.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:28.390" end="00:27:32.530">It's not...to the...but if I go to the art...directory of the</p>

      <p begin="00:31:09.190" end="00:31:12.980">published washer so in a matter of minutes I can really do my</p>
      <p begin="00:31:12.980" end="00:31:17.830">multi devise development really easily so this is one of the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:17.830" end="00:31:21.890">key aspects of the model now let's switch gears and I want to show</p>
      <p begin="00:31:21.890" end="00:31:28.300">you also some of the new capabilities from platform perspective as well as some of</p>
      <p begin="00:31:28.300" end="00:31:34.720">a api what can you do with the api us?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:34.720" end="00:31:35.220">Samoa.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:38.450" end="00:31:43.020">Thanks again all right so let's close...here.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:43.020" end="00:31:48.650">for these next them all we said it's all about productivity so let's</p>
      <p begin="00:31:48.650" end="00:31:53.110">...really enhances the pro tutti of users from scratch so we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:31:54.340" end="00:31:59.370">them all that allows me to very easily create a project</p>
      <p begin="00:31:59.370" end="00:32:04.250">information in...with nys visualizations so.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:05.330" end="00:32:08.780">In this case let me start a run your project here.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:08.780" end="00:32:14.160">So, I'm going to start and let's call it this is my team.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:14.160" end="00:32:18.270">Builder.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:18.270" end="00:32:23.450">So, I'm going to make it a task...in this case I...focus on the word.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:23.450" end="00:32:28.300">So, all this...of the projects a little bit about this in our in this case</p>
      <p begin="00:32:28.300" end="00:32:31.960">ourselves...person and I all the time so software</p>
      <p begin="00:32:31.960" end="00:32:37.000">projects and most of the time we put the same type of...team structure we have our</p>
      <p begin="00:32:37.000" end="00:32:40.770">...designer we have couple of engineers on a project</p>
      <p begin="00:32:40.770" end="00:32:45.140">lead the only thing that changes is the actual people that are assigned to</p>
      <p begin="00:32:45.140" end="00:32:50.130">a project on the raising the prices so but I want to do this all the time and</p>
      <p begin="00:32:50.130" end="00:32:55.230">it's been a lot of time just reading these diagrams where I pudding work when...the proposals</p>
      <p begin="00:32:55.230" end="00:32:59.830">...so let's see how I can are create a productivity boost</p>
      <p begin="00:32:59.830" end="00:33:03.680">...in a matter of minutes soI'm going to start with the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:03.680" end="00:33:08.520">blind project so let's just are run into see what it does...so the whole project template</p>
      <p begin="00:33:08.520" end="00:33:13.490">from visual studio gives you something that you may be already familiar with</p>
      <p begin="00:33:13.490" end="00:33:18.840">...simple...that allows you to read the selection and display it</p>
      <p begin="00:33:20.220" end="00:33:24.120">on a pop-up now that's not very useful so let's see what</p>
      <p begin="00:33:24.120" end="00:33:30.570">can we do to make it more useful so I'm going to go back to visual studio.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:30.570" end="00:33:34.320">And, open some of the cool behind these the first thing I</p>
      <p begin="00:33:34.320" end="00:33:38.270">want to talk about is one very powerful api</p>
      <p begin="00:33:38.270" end="00:33:42.510">that we have in word that I'm not sure the people realize how powerfully</p>
      <p begin="00:33:42.510" end="00:33:47.410">so I'm going to focus my solution on that one api which is the ability to read and</p>
      <p begin="00:33:47.410" end="00:33:52.390">write open-xml from the document so in this case instead of just reading the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:52.390" end="00:33:56.010">text I'm going to reeves the open-xml</p>
      <p begin="00:33:56.010" end="00:34:00.430">representation of the selection what I do the</p>
      <p begin="00:34:00.430" end="00:34:03.540">...by changing the type that</p>
      <p begin="00:34:03.540" end="00:34:07.980">...request the data out to be return to me in this case I'm doing</p>
      <p begin="00:34:07.980" end="00:34:12.330">...get selected data function requesting text I'm going to change</p>
      <p begin="00:34:12.330" end="00:34:19.730">that to request open xml whoops.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:19.730" end="00:34:21.610">I...these variable to hold the</p>
      <p begin="00:34:21.610" end="00:34:25.320">...so because open some of these much more larger I'm just going to</p>
      <p begin="00:34:25.320" end="00:34:32.030">common these notification...instead of showing it there I'm going to.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:32.030" end="00:34:36.830">Basically put it on that variable so...the xml and...also</p>
      <p begin="00:34:36.830" end="00:34:41.590">...a textbook so that we can see it so for that I'm going to also a</p>
      <p begin="00:34:41.590" end="00:34:46.270">...here...my the fold.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:46.270" end="00:34:51.000">Html so let's see ...those to the apps with you switch back to</p>
      <p begin="00:34:51.000" end="00:34:54.300">word so ok now I have a...works.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:54.300" end="00:34:58.570">Now I have the ability to select something</p>
      <p begin="00:34:58.570" end="00:35:02.730">and get the open-xml representation of that instead of the text</p>
      <p begin="00:35:02.730" end="00:35:06.540">ok that's still not very useful let's make it more interesting so I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:35:06.540" end="00:35:11.240">...close word and show you are quick trick.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:11.240" end="00:35:14.310">In visual studio if you add</p>
      <p begin="00:35:14.310" end="00:35:18.140">...existing document...one open word.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:18.140" end="00:35:22.090">If I come to the project and rightly can say</p>
      <p begin="00:35:22.090" end="00:35:26.920">...existing items you can select any word document...you have in your machine and</p>
      <p begin="00:35:26.920" end="00:35:30.730">added to your project in this case I have these word document that I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:35:30.730" end="00:35:35.550">uses a template and then just delve visual studio...creating a new document</p>
      <p begin="00:35:36.760" end="00:35:40.630">...five just use the documents I'm going to do that because</p>
      <p begin="00:35:40.630" end="00:35:44.180">that document has the project template I want to automate</p>
      <p begin="00:35:44.180" end="00:35:48.990">now another thing I want to do is I not only want to read the selection I</p>
      <p begin="00:35:48.990" end="00:35:51.480">...to actually...create</p>
      <p begin="00:35:51.480" end="00:35:58.280">...with a xml so let's create a bottom here whoops.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:58.280" end="00:35:59.160">It's create a new</p>
      <p begin="00:35:59.160" end="00:36:03.780">...on that allows me to also set the data.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:03.780" end="00:36:07.950">And, I'm going to go to javascript here and also</p>
      <p begin="00:36:07.950" end="00:36:12.440">...the bottom as you can see m using jake...</p>
      <p begin="00:36:12.440" end="00:36:17.910">So, just need to...the bottom to these said data function so all I need to do is</p>
      <p begin="00:36:17.910" end="00:36:21.090">add the said data function.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:21.090" end="00:36:23.700">...the said data function is</p>
      <p begin="00:36:23.700" end="00:36:27.550">actually really simple as well you can see were only calling the</p>
      <p begin="00:36:27.550" end="00:36:31.490">...selected data api and we're processing that open-xml that we saved</p>
      <p begin="00:36:31.490" end="00:36:39.240">into variable so very simple code so let's see how this looks like.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:39.240" end="00:36:43.650">So, now I open my template document you can see there is the template</p>
      <p begin="00:36:43.650" end="00:36:47.540">that I normally generate also user now I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:36:47.540" end="00:36:51.690">our my app team builder...developing it going to</p>
      <p begin="00:36:51.690" end="00:36:56.680">save the document and now the our of open-xml is that you</p>
      <p begin="00:36:56.680" end="00:37:01.670">can not only grab takes you can grab any complex representation of continued words,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:01.670" end="00:37:06.770">for example, in this case I one these diagram this is the type of diagram that I...my opt to generate automatically</p>
      <p begin="00:37:06.770" end="00:37:11.700">for my users sigrid these project simply diagram you can see I have</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.700" end="00:37:15.860">...holders forwarded data would be...I...this up to do is basically</p>
      <p begin="00:37:15.860" end="00:37:20.280">generate these diagrams dynamically based on data coming from the back so let's see how we can do</p>
      <p begin="00:37:20.280" end="00:37:26.620">that the first thing is this object these are...object I actually spent like a good</p>
      <p begin="00:37:26.620" end="00:37:32.100">...just deciding...looks right so the our of these is that you can</p>
      <p begin="00:37:32.100" end="00:37:35.290">select here.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:35.290" end="00:37:37.580">This whole thing and say get the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:37.580" end="00:37:43.200">data I have now the eczema representation here but now with the said they'd</p>
      <p begin="00:37:43.200" end="00:37:45.260">...the same thing from...works.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:46.290" end="00:37:50.150">Order variable into the document ok so now we have the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:50.150" end="00:37:54.800">ability to anything that I can representing worked I can podium</p>
      <p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:37:58.820">...template and spit it out now.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:58.820" end="00:38:03.330">Great we just implemented copy...so still not a very useful</p>
      <p begin="00:38:03.330" end="00:38:08.160">what the part of will make it really compelling is if I can replace these...holders</p>
      <p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:12.940">...actual data and make these really dynamic so let's see how we can go and enable</p>
      <p begin="00:38:12.940" end="00:38:17.960">that for this project so for...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:17.960" end="00:38:24.270">I'm going to go back to visual studio and...data models...load...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:24.270" end="00:38:28.810">From some other place in this case I'm going to just...that but I also want to</p>
      <p begin="00:38:28.810" end="00:38:34.710">demonstrate how you can use any of the libraries that are out there</p>
      <p begin="00:38:34.710" end="00:38:38.570">and javascript in this case I'm going to use angular to enhance this</p>
      <p begin="00:38:38.570" end="00:38:43.450">project so angular makes it really easy to...to the down the uri and that's what</p>
      <p begin="00:38:43.450" end="00:38:47.730">I'm going to do so I'm going to include the angular reference there I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:38:47.730" end="00:38:51.670">going to replace these text in the.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:52.680" end="00:38:57.510">Html with some.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:57.510" end="00:39:02.230">Angular definitions for a couple of things I'm going to have a title I have</p>
      <p begin="00:39:02.230" end="00:39:04.730">an angular app and the corresponding</p>
      <p begin="00:39:04.730" end="00:39:09.420">comptroller for those familiar with angular and then I have an imports for the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:09.420" end="00:39:14.130">number of hours...people will be working on and then...for crumble</p>
      <p begin="00:39:14.130" end="00:39:19.010">...to capture...different roles was going to play those roles and a running total</p>
      <p begin="00:39:19.010" end="00:39:23.880">...I can see...who's working on that now that I have that on my html all</p>
      <p begin="00:39:23.880" end="00:39:27.140">I need to do is come back to my javascript and</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.140" end="00:39:33.270">...the corresponding data model for...in this case I'm going to reach out to a</p>
      <p begin="00:39:33.270" end="00:39:38.120">...for simplicity what you can imagine you could connect to anything...like http,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:38.120" end="00:39:41.390">for example, as we saw in the other case this case I just have some hard</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.390" end="00:39:43.970">...data...some people and the rates</p>
      <p begin="00:39:45.140" end="00:39:48.650">...angular controller and I'm going to who crop...with the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:48.650" end="00:39:53.250">html may also have some variables for this selected people</p>
      <p begin="00:39:53.250" end="00:39:56.230">...as well as the total number of hours capture from the input</p>
      <p begin="00:39:56.230" end="00:39:59.430">...and a function is going to calculate the total based on what I</p>
      <p begin="00:39:59.430" end="00:40:04.840">selector the only thing that I need is a function that allows me to replace the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:04.840" end="00:40:08.900">...holders with the data the user specifying through the html so I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:40:08.900" end="00:40:12.970">going to go and do that I'm going to insert dysfunction called</p>
      <p begin="00:40:12.970" end="00:40:17.830">assign team which is a very simple function is going to receive template</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.830" end="00:40:19.770">...in this case and do a</p>
      <p begin="00:40:19.770" end="00:40:24.440">bunch of replacements just string replacements very simple looking for this string</p>
      <p begin="00:40:24.440" end="00:40:29.840">lead and replace it with the actual selected lead from the user okay and then the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:29.840" end="00:40:34.790">last thing is instead of just passing the role...to my</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.790" end="00:40:38.900">...data I'm just going to before dab pass</p>
      <p begin="00:40:38.900" end="00:40:43.530">it through the replacement functions so I'm going to?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:43.530" end="00:40:45.180">Call assign team here.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:46.340" end="00:40:51.160">...open-xml and the result of that already replaced is going to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:51.160" end="00:40:56.520">be what I want to insert so let's see how about works now</p>
      <p begin="00:40:56.520" end="00:41:01.420">okay so that's going back herereload my</p>
      <p begin="00:41:01.420" end="00:41:08.230">app to get the changes now I'm going to select these again?</p>

      <p begin="00:41:16.080" end="00:41:19.850">...with my said the...so you can see now</p>
      <p begin="00:41:19.850" end="00:41:23.690">I have the diagram...with the real data now if I want</p>
      <p begin="00:41:23.690" end="00:41:28.700">to change that I can of course say all this is too much money let'sfind someone else</p>
      <p begin="00:41:28.700" end="00:41:33.810">those in charge of march those reduce the price groups reduce the price</p>
      <p begin="00:41:33.810" end="00:41:39.000">on that one and I want to so, the data again all so</p>
      <p begin="00:41:39.000" end="00:41:43.480">really seems like it reloaded for some reason moi.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:48.740" end="00:41:52.110">Let me go open selects these worm this is a template.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:55.840" end="00:42:00.550">There you go so good from selection on a of the xml and I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:42:00.550" end="00:42:05.060">...these one with...new values...</p>
      <p begin="00:42:05.060" end="00:42:08.700">worries notes and everything okay there you go so now let's select</p>
      <p begin="00:42:08.700" end="00:42:12.020">...one...the reduce</p>
      <p begin="00:42:12.020" end="00:42:16.800">...the price so very powerful now the only thing I don't want the user to be selecting the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:21.610">template because that's the point right the user...already have...template so let's just</p>
      <p begin="00:42:21.610" end="00:42:26.280">...template as part of my project so the users can use all these</p>
      <p begin="00:42:26.280" end="00:42:33.300">without having to know what the templates so I'm going to our.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:33.300" end="00:42:39.110">Delete these from...file.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:39.110" end="00:42:43.590">...even in the original states...it close word and go</p>
      <p begin="00:42:43.590" end="00:42:50.050">back to visual studio what I'm going to add one file here.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:50.050" end="00:42:51.920">The existing file.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:51.920" end="00:42:53.270">...simple text file.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:54.420" end="00:42:59.750">That basically all it has is that same xml.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:59.750" end="00:43:04.550">I can open that I showed in the textbooks I basically just copied from the...works putting</p>
      <p begin="00:43:04.550" end="00:43:07.120">...put it as part of my...and</p>
      <p begin="00:43:07.120" end="00:43:09.790">...my template so now the only thing I</p>
      <p begin="00:43:09.790" end="00:43:13.470">...need to do is instead of getting the data from</p>
      <p begin="00:43:13.470" end="00:43:17.070">the selection I'm just going to get the template.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:18.310" end="00:43:23.220">So, that change the name of the bottom here and go to my javascript</p>
      <p begin="00:43:23.220" end="00:43:28.550">and goal to the function that gets the data.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:28.550" end="00:43:34.630">So, this is get data from selection I'm going to replace these and</p>
      <p begin="00:43:34.630" end="00:43:39.430">I'm going to put this code and this code basically just loads the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:39.430" end="00:43:43.540">txt file...to the or some of variables so that said</p>
      <p begin="00:43:43.540" end="00:43:52.310">will pick it up so very simple let's see it should work.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:52.310" end="00:43:57.050">Right there's the...now I should be able to come to the end of the document in this</p>

      <p begin="00:44:04.640" end="00:44:07.940">People here and then said the data...you</p>
      <p begin="00:44:07.940" end="00:44:12.850">...so now I have a nab that allows me to automatically generate...and we</p>

      <p begin="00:49:52.660" end="00:49:57.140">and working all the platforms were office works so in the next</p>
      <p begin="00:49:57.140" end="00:50:02.810">three to six months you should expect to see the orange cells coming up</p>

      <p begin="00:50:17.700" end="00:50:22.950">secondly priority is deeper integration so this is something that's coming a</p>
      <p begin="00:50:22.950" end="00:50:25.470">...in the user voice so,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:25.470" end="00:50:28.770">you're not already participating in the user voice please do</p>
      <p begin="00:50:28.770" end="00:50:33.870">so we look at it and we understand a lot of the things that people</p>

      <p begin="00:50:41.140" end="00:50:46.270">want to deeper integration both in terms of the api so we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:50:46.270" end="00:50:51.290">...outing and lighting up new deeper api...we're going to start focusing</p>
      <p begin="00:50:51.290" end="00:50:56.480">on word...and we're going to switch from?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:56.480" end="00:51:01.610">The common api that we have today which work...seamlessly</p>
      <p begin="00:51:01.610" end="00:51:05.180">...and powerpoint to deeper specific</p>
      <p begin="00:51:05.180" end="00:51:08.900">api that are specific to word excel so that you can have</p>
      <p begin="00:51:08.900" end="00:51:13.780">phi and grain control over the new functionality that we</p>
      <p begin="00:51:13.780" end="00:51:18.220">will have available and you will of course will be able to use of</p>
      <p begin="00:51:18.220" end="00:51:22.330">...api along...of the new application-specific api</p>
      <p begin="00:51:22.330" end="00:51:25.550">is the target scenarios...we have four word</p>
      <p begin="00:51:25.550" end="00:51:30.710">...document...scenario so basically you everything you need to create these document</p>
      <p begin="00:51:30.710" end="00:51:35.200">assembly scenarios to...reach functionality for your</p>
      <p begin="00:51:35.200" end="00:51:40.110">end-users in xcel there's obviously the data import a analyses and</p>
      <p begin="00:51:40.110" end="00:51:43.560">visualization scenarios that we want to enable a giving access,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:43.560" end="00:51:48.490">for example, to the charts object model which is something that people have requested a lot I want to create and</p>
      <p begin="00:51:48.490" end="00:51:51.220">...that optimizes generation...chart okay</p>
      <p begin="00:51:51.220" end="00:51:57.570">we'll be able to do something like that now the next thing in deeper integration</p>
      <p begin="00:51:57.570" end="00:52:02.100">is the ux so rubble efforts already mentioned</p>
      <p begin="00:52:02.100" end="00:52:07.980">that we're starting to integrate allow you to extend the reborn</p>
      <p begin="00:52:07.980" end="00:52:12.950">we don't see it really one extensibility necessarily we...more</p>
      <p begin="00:52:12.950" end="00:52:16.860">...this notion of adding, adding commands swore</p>
      <p begin="00:52:16.860" end="00:52:21.230">common extensibility the idea is that...will be able to surface comments</p>
      <p begin="00:52:22.820" end="00:52:27.140">...users are already familiar to use those commands so-if is a</p>
      <p begin="00:52:27.140" end="00:52:31.460">reborn is going to be the reborn but there's going to be a layer of abstraction of your</p>
      <p begin="00:52:31.460" end="00:52:36.240">app will declare...you want to show we will</p>
      <p begin="00:52:36.240" end="00:52:41.030">interpret the differently depending on the client so there are...that don't have a reborn</p>
      <p begin="00:52:41.030" end="00:52:45.430">...for example, are the web axis but you will still be able to project commands and</p>
      <p begin="00:52:45.430" end="00:52:50.790">we will make sure that we put them in the right place that makes sense for the user?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:50.790" end="00:52:54.530">So, if you are interested in learning more about these there's a</p>
      <p begin="00:52:54.530" end="00:52:58.330">decision on wednesday four thirty.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:58.330" end="00:53:03.500">Three thirty pm so we are releasing adding comments in outlook</p>
      <p begin="00:53:03.500" end="00:53:08.900">first...we're starting to work on adding...for word excel and powerpoint and,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:08.900" end="00:53:15.040">expect to have those soon the other thing that we're doing is we're also going to enable different add-in</p>
      <p begin="00:53:15.040" end="00:53:20.230">types so you have seen the task being the content</p>
      <p begin="00:53:20.230" end="00:53:23.840">...the case of...we have the reading...and now the new</p>
      <p begin="00:53:23.840" end="00:53:28.880">pop-pop shape that allows you to have contextuallinks.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:28.880" end="00:53:32.830">We're going to starting enhancing the number and the types of</p>
      <p begin="00:53:32.830" end="00:53:37.760">audis that you can create like for some...you want to extend the open</p>
      <p begin="00:53:37.760" end="00:53:43.050">and save experience we maybe able to give you access to the file open</p>
      <p begin="00:53:43.050" end="00:53:48.350">save and led you project some...functionality over...so,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:48.350" end="00:53:53.060">we are still prioritizing what are the first scenario so again user voice will be</p>
      <p begin="00:53:53.060" end="00:53:58.110">a great way to learn about what is important to you bob this is</p>
      <p begin="00:53:58.110" end="00:54:03.780">a another interesting area where we will be investing in the near future and lastly</p>
      <p begin="00:54:03.780" end="00:54:08.710">...to make sure that you have from a developer perspective all the resources</p>
      <p begin="00:54:08.710" end="00:54:12.920">that you need in order to create high-quality jobs that really helps users</p>
      <p begin="00:54:12.920" end="00:54:16.550">...be more productive so we're going to start investing</p>
      <p begin="00:54:16.550" end="00:54:20.340">...things like ...template this is something that has been</p>
      <p begin="00:54:20.340" end="00:54:25.540">requested quite a bit and let me show you just a quick.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:25.540" end="00:54:32.400">Blooms ofsome of thinking on that area.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:32.400" end="00:54:39.770">So, I'm going to open.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:39.770" end="00:54:44.020">This up so the idea here is hot what can we do to help you</p>
      <p begin="00:54:44.020" end="00:54:48.980">to create great looking apps...really fill in fifth-grade in the</p>
      <p begin="00:54:48.980" end="00:54:54.260">society offers uri so we have heard a lot of requests for</p>
      <p begin="00:54:54.260" end="00:54:57.930">like styling guidance and some help to</p>
      <p begin="00:54:57.930" end="00:55:02.380">...do a better job in terms of integrating into the office you</p>
      <p begin="00:55:02.380" end="00:55:07.410">...the office philosophies so we're starting to think about these idea of the office</p>
      <p begin="00:55:07.410" end="00:55:11.780">...fabric or a set of ui templates that you can use to style your you</p>
      <p begin="00:55:11.780" end="00:55:16.760">...app if you will...that it looks and feels better inside of his</p>
      <p begin="00:55:16.760" end="00:55:24.060">are going to have...this case I creative or someone emerging creative these are or</p>
      <p begin="00:55:24.060" end="00:55:27.190">...wvu basically illustrates a lot of the things that</p>
      <p begin="00:55:27.190" end="00:55:31.450">we'll be putting out there are resource for developers you will have access to</p>
      <p begin="00:55:31.450" end="00:55:36.960">...the same phones that we use inside office so, the user can</p>
      <p begin="00:55:36.960" end="00:55:41.960">see the consistency between your app on the office user experience so the icon</p>
      <p begin="00:55:41.960" end="00:55:47.280">...griffey is also very important so we will put icons of the you can use them your</p>
      <p begin="00:55:47.280" end="00:55:52.250">...the users will...cycles branding I goes as well as a function I</p>
      <p begin="00:55:52.250" end="00:55:55.600">goes there will be definition for the callers that offers uses</p>
      <p begin="00:55:55.600" end="00:55:58.660">sort of uone you can match the high logical or...</p>
      <p begin="00:55:58.660" end="00:56:04.070">called or things like that we will also thinking about templates for different things like,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:04.070" end="00:56:10.510">for example, bottoms?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:10.510" end="00:56:18.130">Toggle bottoms different types of choices we also have things like</p>
      <p begin="00:56:18.130" end="00:56:23.190">...you want to create a least in this case we will give you all this</p>
      <p begin="00:56:23.190" end="00:56:28.520">styling that you need to create something that looks and feels like office and the</p>
      <p begin="00:56:28.520" end="00:56:34.380">nice thing about these approach and I would love to hear your feedback of these either</p>
      <p begin="00:56:34.380" end="00:56:39.520">via user voice or you can richard to me directly I can give you</p>
      <p begin="00:56:39.520" end="00:56:44.470">...contact information...decision is are we are</p>
      <p begin="00:56:44.470" end="00:56:48.340">plotting to these in a way that we think is going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:56:48.340" end="00:56:51.370">...to consume so in this case the way you will integrate</p>
      <p begin="00:56:51.370" end="00:56:55.390">...is just by creating some links to some siosism javascript files in your</p>
      <p begin="00:56:55.390" end="00:56:59.420">project that's it and then a series of classes that you need to add</p>
      <p begin="00:56:59.420" end="00:57:05.990">...html elements to basically style them the way office</p>
      <p begin="00:57:05.990" end="00:57:10.590">...the same the same items and then this</p>
      <p begin="00:57:10.590" end="00:57:15.280">is really powerful because it really allows you to basically use the look and feel</p>
      <p begin="00:57:15.280" end="00:57:18.280">but still use any framework image javascript framework</p>
      <p begin="00:57:18.280" end="00:57:22.280">you can use or you want to use for rendering and creating the controls of the</p>
      <p begin="00:57:22.280" end="00:57:30.800">ui you can still use so just to demonstrate that let me show you.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:30.800" end="00:57:36.720">In this case the arby's using angular to...so you can see how</p>
      <p begin="00:57:36.720" end="00:57:41.600">a I can use both these ui fabric and...layer on top of some other</p>
      <p begin="00:57:41.600" end="00:57:45.740">existing framework jake...angular or bootstrap or whatever</p>
