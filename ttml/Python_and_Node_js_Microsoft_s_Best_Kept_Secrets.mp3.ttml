      <p begin="00:00:03.390" end="00:00:05.870">Apparently I'm starting with this slide.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:05.870" end="00:00:09.780">So, if you have a...can do...codes can take a picture that and get</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.780" end="00:00:13.070">...on evaluation before you've heard me speak.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.070" end="00:00:19.400">Which I'm okay with...may want to wait and see if I actually say anything you like?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.400" end="00:00:26.190">But, forget started...has been working in software and...industry for five years.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.190" end="00:00:31.550">Most people that's what ten years.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.550" end="00:00:38.810">Twenty was still going twenty-five I feel like many...option here thirty.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.810" end="00:00:45.010">Thirty thirty years example thirty is papal.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.010" end="00:00:50.330">Now you don't have to have been doing this for thirty years you don't...been doing it for ten years to know that</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.330" end="00:00:54.730">your world is changed the software that web building is not the same software we used to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.730" end="00:00:58.600">be building the...we're building it for not the same people the</p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.600" end="00:01:02.280">...interface models and not the same the places we're putting the code</p>
      <p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:09.240">...deploying to are not the same the business models are not the same everything is changed.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:09.240" end="00:01:12.300">And, hopefully your tools...been changing as well because those tools that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.300" end="00:01:14.890">...using five ten thirty years ago</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.890" end="00:01:23.280">...not...not going to be working as well for the new models that we're dealing with.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:26.950">Also in this time and now we're only looking back less than five years microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.950" end="00:01:31.540">...to this is a thing that you've been hearing throughout...you keep hearing the rest of the time</p>
      <p begin="00:01:31.540" end="00:01:35.280">where doing things differently now when more open less secretive.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:36.330" end="00:01:40.450">Contributing more open-source products web more permissive with the licensing</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.450" end="00:01:45.510">...more open to other platforms and other operating systems just a couple weeks ago</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.510" end="00:01:50.360">as up icon big python conference being held in montreal three thousand</p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.360" end="00:01:54.920">...not a huge amount of microsoft fans there.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.920" end="00:01:59.200">And, one of the really common things that I kept hearing over and over again people coming up to</p>
      <p begin="00:01:59.200" end="00:02:02.070">make people coming up to...during the conference I</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.070" end="00:02:08.320">love the new microsoft I don't use windows but I love which you guys are doing.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.320" end="00:02:12.330">I don't use visual studio but I love it.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:12.330" end="00:02:15.950">A whole lot of people who have been noticing the changes that we've been making</p>
      <p begin="00:02:17.190" end="00:02:24.240">and the differences that any effects...that is having on the software industry.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:24.240" end="00:02:30.390">We've changed in this time we're actually getting things right.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:30.390" end="00:02:34.390">What does this mean fear?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.390" end="00:02:38.890">It means you're going to get better open-source software microsoft has been contributing to tools like</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.890" end="00:02:43.480">get to tools like...js php.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.480" end="00:02:44.500">To make these run</p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.500" end="00:02:52.410">better on windows so if you're working on windows you have access to better open-source software.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.410" end="00:02:55.490">You're getting better platforms.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:55.490" end="00:02:59.000">...contributions to linux making improvements to hype of a and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.000" end="00:03:01.300">to our infrastructure so that these</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.300" end="00:03:08.270">opensource platforms well-run better for you so you can have just as good access to them as you would anywhere else.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:08.270" end="00:03:11.950">And, you're getting better opensource tools.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.950" end="00:03:16.010">The tools that we are building a being developed on different models</p>
      <p begin="00:03:16.010" end="00:03:19.490">and a lot of cases which means there...there's more people involved</p>
      <p begin="00:03:19.490" end="00:03:32.320">uses a directly involved in making these tools better in a way that they didn't used to be so they are better tools.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:32.320" end="00:03:36.610">Now this is an ak notes let's get back down-to-earth this session I'm going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.610" end="00:03:40.270">talking about python going to be talking about no js.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:40.270" end="00:03:44.520">And, specifically how we support those in visual studio and also how we support the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.520" end="00:03:45.830">measure.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:45.830" end="00:03:49.520">I'm going to spend the next twenty minutes also talking and then I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:03:49.520" end="00:03:53.330">...individual studio and everything else is...demos so,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.330" end="00:03:57.580">if you have questions come up with told them until the end of the talking bit just in case I get to them</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.580" end="00:04:05.320">and then from then on will be sitting at the demo machine and seeing some cool stuff.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:05.320" end="00:04:11.150">So, what's...dot js and why do we care about it?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:11.150" end="00:04:14.730">No, js is relatively on language</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14.730" end="00:04:19.440">programming environment's probably a better term came about twenty nine twenty ten was starting</p>
      <p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:23.610">to come out it's javascript on the server.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.610" end="00:04:27.300">It's javascript running on top of a really good javascript engine</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.300" end="00:04:30.130">...the veight engine that's came out of crime which</p>
      <p begin="00:04:30.130" end="00:04:37.010">at the time was the best is the fastest ported to run on the server...to do server-side apps so it's a</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.010" end="00:04:41.620">young language but it has all the heritage of javascript and it also has all the future of javascript</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.620" end="00:04:47.760">a six comes along as seven comes along those getting rode back into node.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:47.760" end="00:04:52.720">What this means is that you have...pull of developers...doing front-end development been doing</p>
      <p begin="00:04:52.720" end="00:04:57.610">websites for a long-time who can now extend the scope they're not just front-end developers...full</p>
      <p begin="00:04:57.610" end="00:05:04.290">stack developers because all the javascript I can already do they can now do on the server as well?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:04.290" end="00:05:08.360">And, the cool thing about...js and this can only happen in...language is</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.360" end="00:05:13.040">...asynchronous from this dot they said nothing is going to block</p>
      <p begin="00:05:13.040" end="00:05:19.730">no operation at all is going to stop the program from making progress.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:19.730" end="00:05:21.630">If you're familiar with say shop, you know, as a</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.630" end="00:05:26.520">...await which is common fairly recently merge as had it from the beginning so everything</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.520" end="00:05:31.200">...everything is thoroughly asynchronous which makes it great at handling huge</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31.200" end="00:05:36.340">quantities of parallel requests parallel operations with.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:36.340" end="00:05:45.640">Fav fewer resources than other languages again...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.640" end="00:05:47.820">What about python...and old language</p>
      <p begin="00:05:47.820" end="00:05:53.430">...on twenty five years so now it's older than csharp...java?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.430" end="00:05:56.190">But, it still has a very active development team</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56.190" end="00:06:00.680">...constantly being improved constantly being worked on and it's in a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.680" end="00:06:07.020">constant race with javascript and csharp...who can add this the best new features first.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.020" end="00:06:11.260">And, for a long-time...being winning that race.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.260" end="00:06:13.330">It's a very popular language for teaching</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.330" end="00:06:17.610">...very easy-to-read but it has all of the core concepts that are important</p>
      <p begin="00:06:17.610" end="00:06:22.290">for teaching students how to program it has a full type system even though it</p>
      <p begin="00:06:22.290" end="00:06:27.470">is dynamic typing means you don't spend all your time writing out type names.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:27.470" end="00:06:32.790">And, it has a huge ecosystem of libraries and support basically every cloud provider out</p>
      <p begin="00:06:32.790" end="00:06:34.330">there has python is one of the top</p>
      <p begin="00:06:34.330" end="00:06:38.850">...languages for managing and controlling and deploying</p>
      <p begin="00:06:38.850" end="00:06:41.940">today cloud systems and some of the library</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.940" end="00:06:46.900">...python...so big they have their own conferences libraries like...go libraries like</p>
      <p begin="00:06:46.900" end="00:06:50.330">...have dedicated conferences</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.330" end="00:06:58.300">with attendance in the hundreds of thousands is not just little made up's.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.300" end="00:07:04.650">And, microsoft has support for both of these languages.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:04.650" end="00:07:12.940">Now get...yet this is not a product announcement.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:12.940" end="00:07:15.670">This isn't some we've just decided we can start throwing</p>
      <p begin="00:07:15.670" end="00:07:19.310">days out there and let you start using python...js</p>
      <p begin="00:07:20.510" end="00:07:25.290">buttons had visual studio support to some extent since twenty ten.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:25.290" end="00:07:26.800">That's five years.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:26.800" end="00:07:29.660">That we've been shipping python extension for visual studio to give</p>
      <p begin="00:07:29.660" end="00:07:33.570">you all of the support that I'm going to show you a bit later on...js has been available on</p>
      <p begin="00:07:33.570" end="00:07:41.390">actually since twenty eleven even I was shocked by that when I went back to figure out when it first showed up.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.390" end="00:07:44.930">That's four years we've had no js support on measure this is not something you this is</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44.930" end="00:07:50.940">a serious commitment python no js and not disappearing from the things that we're doing.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:50.940" end="00:07:57.730">And, then not ...brand new ideas or just throwing out the dasi when they stick...to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:57.730" end="00:08:06.710">...the js or...out...for a developers.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.710" end="00:08:10.430">And, that's why when I bring up a checklist of the features that we support for</p>
      <p begin="00:08:10.430" end="00:08:15.200">these in visual studio it's fairly complete.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:15.200" end="00:08:18.410">All the features you'd expect to find...visual...any other language</p>
      <p begin="00:08:18.410" end="00:08:23.020">if you imagine a world where you installed visual studio and it just had python</p>
      <p begin="00:08:23.020" end="00:08:26.470">...just had no js there...just expect all these features to be</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.470" end="00:08:31.130">the and they are we haven't left things out simply because</p>
      <p begin="00:08:31.130" end="00:08:36.550">the different languages we've gone through and filled in all the gaps as best we can so that</p>
      <p begin="00:08:36.550" end="00:08:40.730">...no js will give you...great editing great code completion</p>
      <p begin="00:08:40.730" end="00:08:44.660">great debugging experiences and both of these both of our extensions are</p>
      <p begin="00:08:44.660" end="00:08:50.450">...having the best debugging experiences out there for these two languages.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:50.450" end="00:08:56.580">Profiling is...all of version control...visual studios available.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:56.580" end="00:09:01.540">Remote debugging is a great feature that we've made available and that remote debugging</p>
      <p begin="00:09:01.540" end="00:09:05.130">incidently is cross-platform remote debugging as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:05.130" end="00:09:09.590">Because python...js are inherently cross-platform languages you're running that code on linux</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.590" end="00:09:15.880">you're running it on...you can remotely debugged from visual studio I'll show you that later on.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.880" end="00:09:17.980">And, because this so heavily.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:17.980" end="00:09:21.670">Supported by packages and libraries we have package management billion and this</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.670" end="00:09:25.990">is being developed head of an in sync with some of the...package management</p>
      <p begin="00:09:25.990" end="00:09:30.640">...visual studio or some of it looks a bit different but it is effectively coming to the same</p>
      <p begin="00:09:30.640" end="00:09:39.860">point and we are hoping to linking closer with the general visual studio supporter packages soon.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:39.860" end="00:09:42.380">Become to leisure and again the pictures fairly complete.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:43.390" end="00:09:47.780">This is not languages we've just spun up within working on this for a while all the web apps</p>
      <p begin="00:09:47.780" end="00:09:51.130">with support python...js and have done fears?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:51.130" end="00:09:54.660">Cloud service will course...you do that linux and windows</p>
      <p begin="00:09:54.660" end="00:10:01.040">va m which are available and I'll show you can do whatever you want and that includes python and...js.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:05.950">The storage services most of the platform services in fact the application</p>
      <p begin="00:10:05.950" end="00:10:10.910">insides has a really great sdk from both languages document the base supports</p>
      <p begin="00:10:10.910" end="00:10:15.690">both languages these are services that you can use today from python</p>
      <p begin="00:10:15.690" end="00:10:20.010">...js and not feel like you're a second-class citizen this</p>
      <p begin="00:10:20.010" end="00:10:24.790">...proper like first-class support for these languages.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:24.790" end="00:10:29.490">And, machine learning which is one of...only recently.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:29.490" end="00:10:34.120">Fully released has python support built into it and fact any other language</p>
      <p begin="00:10:34.120" end="00:10:39.390">...machine learning right...and,...both open-source languages you</p>
      <p begin="00:10:39.390" end="00:10:50.140">can't even you can't do dot net in that yet that's really rare for us what changing.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:50.140" end="00:10:53.090">But, here's a question expected asking why would I use python.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:54.220" end="00:10:57.500">Why would I...js when should I use that?</p>

      <p begin="00:19:04.770" end="00:19:07.480">There's a bit of boiler plate here but eventually we're going to end up with</p>

      <p begin="00:22:58.540" end="00:23:03.750">And, in fact I'll show you that because I'll start running.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:03.750" end="00:23:11.390">And, now we're in debug mode...debugging this script so it's going to start spitting out output here bring it up the.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:11.390" end="00:23:16.780">And, what this vm image that I'm using actually does?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:16.780" end="00:23:17.790">Should...output?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:18.950" end="00:23:23.300">What is the...image amusing actually does is it has a...compiler...stowed so it's not just</p>
      <p begin="00:23:23.300" end="00:23:28.840">a plain old...has a...compiler and has a basic web app running on it so I can</p>
      <p begin="00:23:28.840" end="00:23:32.730">spin up this pm and say hey here's a python package that includes some</p>
      <p begin="00:23:32.730" end="00:23:38.330">c code that I need a compiler...want to install use this package?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:38.330" end="00:23:42.060">So, I don't have so I doing this I do on this machine but I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:23:42.060" end="00:23:44.060">insource package on thousand machines and they don't...</p>
      <p begin="00:23:44.060" end="00:23:49.040">to say compiler so by using this virtual machine I can spin up</p>
      <p begin="00:23:49.040" end="00:23:53.380">a machine with...compiler quickly build the package and then take</p>
      <p begin="00:23:53.380" end="00:24:00.700">the result and publish that all these other machine so I don't actually need a compiler on each of them.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:00.700" end="00:24:04.380">And, to do that...exposes basically a web service so</p>
      <p begin="00:24:04.380" end="00:24:08.250">when the virtual machine is created and running again...request</p>
      <p begin="00:24:08.250" end="00:24:14.520">...request that says hey you do this will command on the package flask.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:14.520" end="00:24:19.160">An understanding that from python...line of code just a simple get request.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:19.160" end="00:24:23.870">Then I'm going to...in the browser so we can say some results coming in and</p>
      <p begin="00:24:23.870" end="00:24:30.680">...we're just going to kill of the machine because the longer the machine is running for the more we get charged.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:30.680" end="00:24:36.680">I considered not showing...because everything up to this point has been completely free.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:36.680" end="00:24:41.170">And, the virtual machine running is how we make money but if you kill it really quickly we don't make as much money</p>
      <p begin="00:24:41.170" end="00:24:46.990">...here so if you want to leave it running feel free but,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:46.990" end="00:24:53.410">you probably one...kill it off as quickly as you can.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:53.410" end="00:24:57.920">Ok, so, windows...so the time between starting the machine and it actually running and being able</p>
      <p begin="00:24:57.920" end="00:25:03.400">to respond to a web request may take a little while.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:03.400" end="00:25:07.220">And, I got through my explanation a little bit quicker than at...</p>
      <p begin="00:25:07.220" end="00:25:11.750">So, that is still going but it is working which is a positive</p>
      <p begin="00:25:11.750" end="00:25:18.320">sign anytime you doing a demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:22.060">So, other things that you may use this sort of process for this is the sort of thing where</p>
      <p begin="00:25:22.060" end="00:25:27.370">you maybe you have a task...once a month you need to grab a huge amount of daughter out of the way</p>
      <p begin="00:25:27.370" end="00:25:32.240">house somewhere and process and you need a really big base machine we have virtual machines on as</p>
      <p begin="00:25:32.240" end="00:25:35.210">...that have what...it four hundred</p>
      <p begin="00:25:35.210" end="00:25:41.210">megabytes of ram and we'll give you five terabytes of ss day?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:41.210" end="00:25:44.050">And, if you're working with a huge data set.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:44.050" end="00:25:48.100">That's the sort of machine that this can actually help you with but it's not a machine you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:25:48.100" end="00:25:50.750">...running all the time.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:50.750" end="00:25:55.280">Unless you really want to give us...money in which case feel free...caped running all the time but,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:55.280" end="00:25:59.830">you don't want to...that machine running all the time you want spin it up and spend five minutes to</p>
      <p begin="00:25:59.830" end="00:26:02.460">...processing and then shutdowns</p>
      <p begin="00:26:02.460" end="00:26:05.170">quick as possible this is ideal for that.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:05.170" end="00:26:07.950">Because when this machine starts up it's going to run what...startup</p>
      <p begin="00:26:07.950" end="00:26:12.150">...has you can automate the entire process.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:12.150" end="00:26:16.450">Now the...ready and we hit the brake point here so I can see the url.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:16.450" end="00:26:21.370">Where the machine is at adjoining that and we're going to do a request so that's nice and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:21.370" end="00:26:30.060">quick to get to trigger the process and now spin up the web browser?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:30.060" end="00:26:35.600">Which is simply showing me a list of how much of flask build so-if us</p>
      <p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:37.320">...refresh?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:37.320" end="00:26:50.510">We should sit...packages appearing here.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:50.510" end="00:26:55.300">So, this is downloaded some packages of the python package index</p>
      <p begin="00:26:55.300" end="00:27:00.650">its compiling them and putting them into a redistribute of performant coda we'll.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:00.650" end="00:27:05.540">...safe is the one the of interest because this has compiled</p>
      <p begin="00:27:05.540" end="00:27:10.000">see module in it may not be...to say that on the screen but that file of highlighted is a</p>
      <p begin="00:27:10.000" end="00:27:14.490">compiled module that we just built with the compiler on that machine now it's</p>
      <p begin="00:27:14.490" end="00:27:21.890">in zip file so I can just copied onto the machines that need it and none of them the compiler.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:21.890" end="00:27:23.320">And, back here we're just going to delete the</p>
      <p begin="00:27:23.320" end="00:27:31.360">...the...deployment...operation and clean-up...service.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:34.150">And, then we'll be done that virtual machine that we just created</p>
      <p begin="00:27:34.150" end="00:27:36.890">run some task and now destroyed</p>
      <p begin="00:27:36.890" end="00:27:42.890">probably ten twenty cents worth of time.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42.890" end="00:27:47.740">And, this is automated so you haven't even had to pay someone to sit here and do this?</p>
      <p begin="00:27:47.740" end="00:27:51.420">So, when you've got operations that need a separate machine or need</p>
      <p begin="00:27:51.420" end="00:27:59.500">high processing requirements this is a great way to automate being out...run anti process?</p>
      <p begin="00:27:59.500" end="00:28:14.270">I want to throughout any questions about that one suggest anything else media...from move on.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:14.270" end="00:28:19.000">So, next demos a web api wrap-up.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:19.000" end="00:28:23.210">As I mentioned that's...js glorified proxy is.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:24.280" end="00:28:31.140">A little unfair but still completely accurate at the same time so we're going to do that here I</p>
      <p begin="00:28:31.140" end="00:28:35.630">have an old crafty api that's actually written in python because it was</p>
      <p begin="00:28:35.630" end="00:28:37.120">quick.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:37.120" end="00:28:41.810">And, it's returning big chunky xml data from some internal</p>
      <p begin="00:28:41.810" end="00:28:48.840">system that I've got that I don't really want to go in this about with the code at this point.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:48.840" end="00:28:53.630">I do want to expose it as jason I do want to expose it in a way that other people can get</p>
      <p begin="00:28:53.630" end="00:28:58.520">what and use it and the other thing that I really want to do is fix-up as annoying to digit years</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58.520" end="00:29:02.560">in the dates and make it a nice.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:02.560" end="00:29:03.360">Portable date</p>
      <p begin="00:29:03.360" end="00:29:11.790">format that people outside of the us can understand because they got the month...the day the right way around.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:11.790" end="00:29:21.010">...that sound bill that wasn't meant...</p>
      <p begin="00:29:21.010" end="00:29:25.120">So, this is the across the api...python code.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:25.120" end="00:29:32.590">It's just the sake of a demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:32.590" end="00:29:36.500">And, just...the sake of demonstrating I've got a basic little thing here that's just going to show</p>
      <p begin="00:29:36.500" end="00:29:42.820">you some of the data that's inthis is what sending back this is the api that</p>
      <p begin="00:29:42.820" end="00:29:47.800">I'm telling my mobile developers you have to use this you have to write a web page</p>
      <p begin="00:29:47.800" end="00:29:49.340">...some javascript to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:49.340" end="00:29:54.810">figure this out and display all of that information there.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:54.810" end="00:30:07.260">Sand this data...third...third of july node.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:07.260" end="00:30:12.220">I'm going to go through this and I'm and I have a cloud service here.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:12.220" end="00:30:16.550">All of the support...in visual studio already is going to work for...node.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:16.550" end="00:30:20.360">Because we've made it work with extended on top of the video studio support so it</p>
      <p begin="00:30:20.360" end="00:30:24.150">can not sure how to do a web up with python node.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:24.150" end="00:30:27.700">You actually just make a web project and then exactly the same ways</p>
      <p begin="00:30:27.700" end="00:30:32.860">...directly to...say publish the same thing here we have a cloud service so I want</p>
      <p begin="00:30:32.860" end="00:30:37.690">to web role in this case I'm going to add a new role project.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:37.690" end="00:30:40.470">And, go to know js.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:40.470" end="00:30:43.120">And, just make a web role.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:43.120" end="00:30:48.930">This will give me a basic node application complete with a bright point a basic</p>
      <p begin="00:30:48.930" end="00:30:53.090">node application that I can start coding and to make a web app that's</p>
      <p begin="00:30:53.090" end="00:31:00.920">going to forward incoming requests onto that can server and reprocess...on the way out.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:00.920" end="00:31:05.030">To help me out here I might have free written some of these and I'm going to do some copy taste.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:05.030" end="00:31:11.640">So, every time the notepad window pops up just close your eyes.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:11.640" end="00:31:14.240">Starting with some requires no js has a whole lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:17.100">packages as well and these absolutely essential if you're</p>
      <p begin="00:31:17.100" end="00:31:22.080">going to be working with it and the require statement is how you bring those</p>
      <p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:27.200">in will actually give you suggestions when you start requiring stuff.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:31.230">Just like in python when you type import rule display of the packages you can import will give you the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:31.230" end="00:31:37.760">full list of everything that's there for...u.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:40.740">And, the first one of these I'm going to use is the url.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:41.860" end="00:31:45.350">Package because I need to do some pausing on the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:45.350" end="00:31:50.280">request this function taking...and res is going to handle every single incoming</p>
      <p begin="00:31:50.280" end="00:31:52.330">request to this process.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:52.330" end="00:31:57.560">So, I need to be out of rout these around a hundred different ways you can do url routing in</p>
      <p begin="00:31:57.560" end="00:32:03.980">...doing it fairly simply just using the route package because I don't have that many to deal with.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:03.980" end="00:32:07.830">The first thing I'm going to do is pull the path name out of the url.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:07.830" end="00:32:11.410">So, urls...function and</p>
      <p begin="00:32:11.410" end="00:32:15.200">then wrecked euro and that should give me a path name back.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:15.200" end="00:32:19.540">That is going to be the name of the path so everything after</p>
      <p begin="00:32:19.540" end="00:32:29.530">the in my case local host import everything after the host is going to be in the path name.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:29.530" end="00:32:31.620">You can cheat grab some code.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:31.620" end="00:32:37.030">Because what we do here is we call through into these routes so the routing module...the path</p>
      <p begin="00:32:37.030" end="00:32:41.600">match module more specifically let me define basically some comparisons effectively</p>
      <p begin="00:32:41.600" end="00:32:46.590">array x that also doesn't parameter substitution so when I</p>
      <p begin="00:32:46.590" end="00:32:51.070">say let's get the parameters from...summary from path name it's going to</p>
      <p begin="00:32:51.070" end="00:32:56.940">match user and then put id into a property which you can see right here.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:56.940" end="00:33:01.470">We had then going-to-take that property positive function that I haven't written yet.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:01.470" end="00:33:05.410">That is going to get the user info out of that extracted and give us back</p>
      <p begin="00:33:05.410" end="00:33:10.740">this data object which...jason and return to the user so this is the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:10.740" end="00:33:13.940">...functionality of the proxy.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:13.940" end="00:33:18.610">We're getting we're going to get the data for a certain id and we're going to reprocess</p>
      <p begin="00:33:18.610" end="00:33:20.440">it into something that is javascript</p>
      <p begin="00:33:20.440" end="00:33:29.710">the converted to jason and res that end we'll send it back as a response the request.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:29.710" end="00:33:34.210">This function that I need is going to get user infer.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:34.210" end="00:33:37.000">Well-taken id.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:37.000" end="00:33:39.500">And, because it's.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:39.500" end="00:33:44.350">...we are thoroughly asynchronous so with my function I get the input</p>
      <p begin="00:33:44.350" end="00:33:49.160">parameter which is id and I also get a call back function which are code dot...because we're going to call it when I've got the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:49.160" end="00:33:54.970">infer I m sure there is a</p>
      <p begin="00:33:54.970" end="00:33:59.760">good style name for that but I don't actually know what it is for this case</p>
      <p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:10.340">got info seems to work...</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.340" end="00:34:15.760">And, the first thing we're going to do is to go straight to and http get.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:15.760" end="00:34:21.090">So, again, ok, apparently call backs a good name for it that's what I shape uses.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:21.090" end="00:34:26.270">We're going to do...inside this get...going to take more code from here.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:26.270" end="00:34:33.220">We're going to...in this case a really poorly hard coded reference to the old api.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:33.220" end="00:34:38.210">But, this may be exactly what you do if you're owed api is an old program you</p>

      <p begin="00:34:41.190" end="00:34:46.020">deploy this proxy on the same machine and then you...just forwarding requests...local host.</p>

      <p begin="00:35:13.050" end="00:35:18.000">Then we wantcold call back immediately and you can</p>
      <p begin="00:35:18.000" end="00:35:22.340">say that this call back function is expecting to get the status...expecting to get</p>
      <p begin="00:35:22.340" end="00:35:27.310">...data that we have in this case we only have the status because it's a failure so</p>
      <p begin="00:35:27.310" end="00:35:30.060">we just...that in and then we'll get out of here.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:30.060" end="00:35:33.630">And, now we know that at this point our...succeeded we have</p>

      <p begin="00:35:53.840" end="00:35:57.360">I didn't think so.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:57.360" end="00:36:00.330">But, it's actually not a bad choice for doing this so what I've done is I've</p>
      <p begin="00:36:00.330" end="00:36:05.120">grab the xml dom package and the x path package.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:05.120" end="00:36:10.030">Actually xml...might be standard think about it...</p>
      <p begin="00:36:10.030" end="00:36:13.710">...these to packages to help me posse xml because I really.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:13.710" end="00:36:17.460">Don't want to be doing this client-side I don't have to be rely on xml pausing client-side if</p>
      <p begin="00:36:17.460" end="00:36:22.370">...all possible so I'm doing that here on the server?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:22.370" end="00:36:27.180">There's a bit of boiler plate code effectively forgetting all of the data out</p>
      <p begin="00:36:27.180" end="00:36:30.830">of the request is asynchronous so you need call backs that will</p>
      <p begin="00:36:30.830" end="00:36:36.030">...repeatedly being cold until everything's complete.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:36.030" end="00:36:41.430">And, then I simply posit document from the string from the response and just define</p>
      <p begin="00:36:41.430" end="00:36:43.160">an object.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:43.160" end="00:36:48.140">So, this use a objected of created has all of these properties as a balance it has a history it has</p>
      <p begin="00:36:48.140" end="00:36:51.450">an id has a name we've recognized all of these properties.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:52.530" end="00:36:55.740">On the object from this definition.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:55.740" end="00:37:01.760">And, we should in fact even though the...because we've called to string on everything.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:01.760" end="00:37:06.990">And, this gives us a javascript object that we then pasta got infer.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:06.990" end="00:37:11.960">So, then the result of good info which should be here.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.960" end="00:37:18.110">Is going-to-take that...that make it into jason and return?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:18.110" end="00:37:25.590">And, that shooting...done everything right should be enough.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:25.590" end="00:37:32.560">js layer no, it's not enough it's not enough because I have...stony packages yet.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:32.560" end="00:37:36.820">So, no, js has a convention of a...file.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:36.820" end="00:37:41.850">Which includes a list of all the dependencies that your package needs?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:41.850" end="00:37:46.250">The nice thing about these is that when you go to publisher package</p>
      <p begin="00:37:46.250" end="00:37:51.220">on to and pm which is the package repository you need to provide this file when you're building a project you need to</p>
      <p begin="00:37:51.220" end="00:37:53.700">have this file so if you've worked on any</p>
      <p begin="00:37:53.700" end="00:37:57.840">no js code at all you have something that can be published which means there's a lot of code</p>
      <p begin="00:37:57.840" end="00:38:03.900">that's been published you have a lot of choices when it comes to doing basically anything in the js.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:03.900" end="00:38:08.670">Now if you're watching you'll notice that after I added those dependency lines we suddenly showed up with a few</p>
      <p begin="00:38:08.670" end="00:38:17.160">missing dependencies here so I can simply install missing and pm packages to go off and get all of those.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:17.160" end="00:38:22.200">Another...soda now when I start running the code.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:22.200" end="00:38:28.790">We running successfully and of jumped over to our new api page.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:28.790" end="00:38:32.520">Which I already have urls here so this is the old?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:32.520" end="00:38:35.180">This is the old xml that we don't ever want to</p>
      <p begin="00:38:35.180" end="00:38:39.130">sagan and in just a small amount of node code we suddenly have</p>
      <p begin="00:38:39.130" end="00:38:44.010">jason that can be easily possum the client can be...any browser</p>
      <p begin="00:38:44.010" end="00:38:47.350">any mobile device tablet pc.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:47.350" end="00:38:53.600">Gaining consul anything that can render a web page cannot...and display that information.</p>

      <p begin="00:39:00.460" end="00:39:05.670">So, that's how we go...that.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:05.670" end="00:39:09.700">The point where handling the date is right here.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:09.700" end="00:39:15.950">...have an...selects and just getting the date from the use of converting into a strength.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:15.950" end="00:39:28.830">...I'm going to write a function code fixed...so just call it that.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:28.830" end="00:39:32.830">And, now...function fix state and weary recognize...string.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:32.830" end="00:39:36.880">So,...just...function low type definitions we...the information through or from the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:36.880" end="00:39:40.670">...site down below it so we can tell you that.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:40.670" end="00:39:52.830">This parameter has all of these members on it because we know it's a strength.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:52.830" end="00:39:58.910">Little bit of basic javascript code...it up will...on the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:58.910" end="00:40:03.040">twenty...start...the year and then we'll reformat in into a data object which</p>
      <p begin="00:40:03.040" end="00:40:07.190">when we convert jason is going to look far more.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:07.190" end="00:40:10.840">Readable and nb from a portable.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:10.840" end="00:40:19.460">And, just...break points and actually step through some of this time and see what we get.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:19.460" end="00:40:22.210">So, again, couple great points hit...five.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:22.210" end="00:40:24.340">And, within the first request come in I can</p>
      <p begin="00:40:24.340" end="00:40:28.880">...the url and say the request is coming through and it's...for the slash.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:32.420">Which is not going to...that it's not going to matches summary</p>
      <p begin="00:40:32.420" end="00:40:40.300">it matches home which is where we get the welcome to our api from?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:40.300" end="00:40:40.830">Now this time</p>
      <p begin="00:40:40.830" end="00:40:47.490">when I hope over here now we've come back in and the and url in this case is use a one-oh-one.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:47.490" end="00:40:50.590">After we posit into programs.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.590" end="00:40:58.480">Can say we have the idea here which is one-oh-one which is the...trying to get sorry for that being so small?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:58.480" end="00:41:00.810">And, now we fallen out because</p>
      <p begin="00:41:00.810" end="00:41:05.300">...that we've made is asynchronous so the next step doesn't happen until it's ready for</p>
      <p begin="00:41:05.300" end="00:41:08.610">it to happen and now skip to head of it so way into</p>
      <p begin="00:41:08.610" end="00:41:12.220">the point after the request of the back-end api has come through.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:13.620" end="00:41:14.500">Or about pussy upwards</p>
      <p begin="00:41:14.500" end="00:41:20.170">...the output which is the xml...I'm actually let me bring that up in the xml visualize</p>
      <p begin="00:41:20.170" end="00:41:27.780">of to show that if you want to look at xml inside visual studio we can format nicely for</p>
      <p begin="00:41:27.780" end="00:41:32.080">And, we can in fact through that for a few other formats as well none of which makes sense</p>
      <p begin="00:41:32.080" end="00:41:36.150">and xml string but we have an html and jason visualize a as well as just a</p>
      <p begin="00:41:36.150" end="00:41:36.650">plain-text.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:38.500">Visualize which</p>
      <p begin="00:41:38.500" end="00:41:45.500">will show you the current state of your program in a way that makes sense and helpful fear.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:45.500" end="00:41:46.780">And, this time when I</p>
      <p begin="00:41:46.780" end="00:41:52.740">step in wave ended up inside the xbox module.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:52.740" end="00:41:57.450">Which looks like a scary place to basal let's not do that?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:57.450" end="00:41:59.350">And, our and fix state.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:59.350" end="00:42:01.830">Inside here we can say the strings for twenty fifteen.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:02.920" end="00:42:06.650">We split we have an array.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:06.650" end="00:42:08.190">With adjusted the year so,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:08.190" end="00:42:17.860">now the years has twenty fifteen and we can pass into the elements for...</p>
      <p begin="00:42:17.860" end="00:42:22.380">And,...you dates.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:22.380" end="00:42:26.670">And, now we've got the infer so now we're going to...string...the data.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:26.670" end="00:42:29.960">And, hopefully at some point we get.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:29.960" end="00:42:34.980">Here's the data so now I have jason's I can previous with adjacent visualize and,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:34.980" end="00:42:37.010">this one's even more advanced we've got nice</p>
      <p begin="00:42:37.010" end="00:42:41.760">tree view we can actually search through defined properties that we want to look at inside the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:41.760" end="00:42:48.590">...all inside visual studio while I'm debugging this program.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:48.590" end="00:42:52.100">And, now when I continue out...say the dates...formatted unambiguous</p>
      <p begin="00:42:52.100" end="00:42:58.830">...it's even figured out that it was seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:58.830" end="00:43:00.870">And, we know that this is in fact</p>
      <p begin="00:43:02.090" end="00:43:10.400">...twelve and not the twelve another third of december.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:10.400" end="00:43:17.280">So, that's no js one anyone ask anything about the from move on.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:17.280" end="00:43:20.470">Can you do this and piping yes you can what recommended</p>
      <p begin="00:43:20.470" end="00:43:25.360">probably not the some libraries that will give you high-volume request a</p>
      <p begin="00:43:25.360" end="00:43:30.540">high-frequency requests in python just as well as no js handles them but they're not</p>
      <p begin="00:43:30.540" end="00:43:35.850">...interlanguage in the same way no js is ideal for this kind of...</p>
      <p begin="00:43:35.850" end="00:43:55.480">So, it's going to be a good choice.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:55.480" end="00:43:58.770">For my final trick.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:58.770" end="00:44:03.310">This is more an interesting demo of the visual studio support.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:03.310" end="00:44:03.990">Then something you</p>
      <p begin="00:44:03.990" end="00:44:08.920">might actually decide to do as a result of having being to this session</p>
      <p begin="00:44:08.920" end="00:44:13.660">...the last two things have inspired your in some interesting ways that maybe you can automate</p>
      <p begin="00:44:13.660" end="00:44:16.940">...processes without spending a huge amount of time developing the</p>
      <p begin="00:44:16.940" end="00:44:22.470">tool for it or maybe you can make that old horrible api something that people actually want</p>
      <p begin="00:44:22.470" end="00:44:27.000">to use this one's a little bit just more fun.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:27.000" end="00:44:31.150">And, something that if you're already using these sorts of things</p>
      <p begin="00:44:31.150" end="00:44:35.820">then you may find this usefully may find this really appealing and definitely a lot of people have told us this</p>
      <p begin="00:44:35.820" end="00:44:43.440">is a great value and for the stuff that doing so I have a python script running on a linux machine.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:43.890">Why is</p>
      <p begin="00:44:43.890" end="00:44:48.510">running on linux machine because it has some dependency that one work on windows?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:48.510" end="00:44:53.070">That's not strictly the case for this demo but it may be the case is absolutely feasible that</p>
      <p begin="00:44:53.070" end="00:44:55.320">...some tool some program that you need to be</p>
      <p begin="00:44:55.320" end="00:45:01.640">running on linux that cannot be run on windows so you have a script that's doing it.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:01.640" end="00:45:05.640">But, something is not working properly and that script is not working very well.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:05.640" end="00:45:08.040">And,...a python script so the</p>
      <p begin="00:45:08.040" end="00:45:12.130">...choices...go...out a whole lot of logging to try and figure out what's going on</p>
      <p begin="00:45:13.410" end="00:45:18.030">all you can dive in and try and use one of the regular python debug is</p>
      <p begin="00:45:18.030" end="00:45:22.770">or use one of the linux important python debugging none of which are</p>
      <p begin="00:45:22.770" end="00:45:27.550">as good to uses visual studio so this is the third option</p>
      <p begin="00:45:27.550" end="00:45:32.490">which is let's enable remote debugging on the linux machine so that we can connect</p>
      <p begin="00:45:32.490" end="00:45:36.140">...from visual studio and get all the benefits all the functionality of</p>
      <p begin="00:45:36.140" end="00:45:48.450">...without having to without having to move the code somehow to a local machine.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:48.450" end="00:45:55.330">So, I'm going to start on my machine just show you what's going on.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:55.330" end="00:45:59.650">Here's my script what's actually doing is taking some my holiday photos</p>
      <p begin="00:45:59.650" end="00:46:02.450">and creating thumbnails for them.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:02.450" end="00:46:06.780">So, I put a whole lot of photos up in some measure storage blobs.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:06.780" end="00:46:08.690">And, it's downloading the photo it's running it through</p>
      <p begin="00:46:08.690" end="00:46:13.840">an image processing library which is my only works on linux example fitted I it actually works</p>
      <p begin="00:46:13.840" end="00:46:18.720">...windows but for this...it's running on linux.</p>

      <p begin="00:46:21.200" end="00:46:26.070">...eras when I cancel it...printing out...of urls.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:26.070" end="00:46:31.630">So, the first url...printing out is just to remind me which one it's gotten.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:31.630" end="00:46:35.250">And, there's my image this is from my last trip...</p>
      <p begin="00:46:35.250" end="00:46:39.750">That's a tram in fact you probably know about those because they have kind of things like them hidden</p>
      <p begin="00:46:39.750" end="00:46:41.830">...san francisco that's</p>
      <p begin="00:46:41.830" end="00:46:45.380">...tram very nice way of getting around.</p>

      <p begin="00:46:48.780" end="00:46:52.260">For that and you can see the differences with actually put it in a</p>

      <p begin="00:46:58.190" end="00:47:07.690">So, the steps...descriptive gone through in fact I bring up the code that I can show you.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:07.690" end="00:47:12.330">Just like before we createdso, from the actual library we imported</p>
      <p begin="00:47:12.330" end="00:47:21.230">the service management service before the some using a bob service because we're dealing with blobs...storage.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:21.230" end="00:47:27.220">...listing them and here out to container definitions bit of code to just create goes but then the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:27.220" end="00:47:31.140">...we're going to this container and we listing all the blobs that there is giving</p>
      <p begin="00:47:31.140" end="00:47:37.280">us details about everything that's already in that container which in this case is all of my holiday photos.</p>

      <p begin="00:47:44.300" end="00:47:49.050">And, then we're doing...get love to butts that's going to often download that image and just loaded into memory so now we have</p>
      <p begin="00:47:49.050" end="00:47:52.550">...jpeg in memory...a python script.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:52.550" end="00:47:56.310">And, this imaged open is the library this libraries code</p>

      <p begin="00:48:00.620" end="00:48:05.470">pillar these days there was a dispute about compatibility and</p>
      <p begin="00:48:05.470" end="00:48:09.870">...at some point and these days pillow is the one that works but,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:09.870" end="00:48:14.750">this is just a really nice simple image processing library for python.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:14.750" end="00:48:23.930">So, we'll open that from the in memory file grab the size of...we're going to crappie image into a square.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:23.930" end="00:48:28.210">We're going to run edge enhancement because I thought that might be a good idea looking at the thumbnails</p>
      <p begin="00:48:28.210" end="00:48:32.970">it isn't but it might have been.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:32.970" end="00:48:37.880">I'm guilty of not updating my comments because we're going to resize to hundred-fifty by hundred-fifty which.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:37.880" end="00:48:40.380">Is...on now?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:40.380" end="00:48:44.020">Finally we put the data back into a...io which is</p>

      <p begin="00:48:48.060" end="00:48:52.060">And, then put the block lowball from that in memory stream and push that back up to</p>

      <p begin="00:48:58.720" end="00:49:05.840">job is doing is fine because I couldn't come up with a good bug for to have but we're going-to go ahead and debugged anyway.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:05.840" end="00:49:09.600">So, a couple of things we need to do to and I would debugging.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:09.600" end="00:49:10.820">First.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:10.820" end="00:49:14.710">We need to import and install pst.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:14.710" end="00:49:16.030">...visual studio...</p>
      <p begin="00:49:17.130" end="00:49:20.730">This is a module that I don't have installed locally but I don't</p>
      <p begin="00:49:20.730" end="00:49:25.170">...on this machine because it's only going to be running on the remote wishing.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:25.170" end="00:49:32.300">This will let me set up a socket connection so that I can connect into the running process.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:32.300" end="00:49:33.770">There's a whole lot of parameters you can specify</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.770" end="00:49:37.370">...the first one unspecified is the secret which is a password.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38.480" end="00:49:42.510">So, if you've been paying attention you could now be attaching...you can't yet after</p>
      <p begin="00:49:42.510" end="00:49:47.360">I publish this change you could be attaching to the my process before I get...please don't do that...going to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:47.360" end="00:49:53.820">spoil the demo but you could be because you've now...the sacred and as you anything keeping you out.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:53.820" end="00:49:58.500">And, then we're...wait for...you don't have to do this but this is convenient if you're planning to debug from the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:58.500" end="00:50:05.150">start of the code it's just going to hold up until you've actually attach the debug.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:05.150" end="00:50:07.420">Another publish this.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:07.420" end="00:50:09.800">...prompt.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:09.800" end="00:50:14.100">This is a crazy command so I wrote into a batch file.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:14.100" end="00:50:15.400">And, that's just uploaded using</p>
      <p begin="00:50:15.400" end="00:50:19.610">...of just transfer the file over sh and now it's</p>
      <p begin="00:50:19.610" end="00:50:25.120">...the machine if I pull up nano demo here you can say that we've now</p>
      <p begin="00:50:25.120" end="00:50:30.030">got this code has been updated.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:30.030" end="00:50:37.590">The next...actually so pbs day because I don't have it on this machine yet.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:37.590" end="00:50:39.000">...is a package management</p>
      <p begin="00:50:39.000" end="00:50:43.270">...pippen stole is going to install the package dashed...free is going to install pre</p>
      <p begin="00:50:43.270" end="00:50:47.120">release versions which I need because I'm running python two-point-two ossie.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:48.380" end="00:50:51.880">So, it needs a slightly newer version them you'd normally install if you didn't put a dash</p>
      <p begin="00:50:51.880" end="00:50:56.710">...because you get...one for...to python tools two-point-one.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:56.710" end="00:51:00.930">This is going to go often install the package.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:00.930" end="00:51:04.620">And, once this is done I can just start running the script again.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:04.620" end="00:51:18.450">And, will be good to set will be go-to...have a look?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:18.450" end="00:51:23.760">And, this time you...not doing anything it's waiting for me to attached.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:23.760" end="00:51:26.280">Come back to visual studio.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:26.280" end="00:51:31.390">...debug I can attach to process.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:31.390" end="00:51:32.740">Python remote debugging is</p>

      <p begin="00:52:15.410" end="00:52:21.650">okay when you hit enter in this box you'll see a list of the running python processes on that machine and it's telling me it's a</p>
      <p begin="00:52:21.650" end="00:52:30.090">python three five linux sixty four-bit and I'm going to touch and now we're running.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:30.090" end="00:52:36.460">I can jump back over here and it's taking me back because...a break point.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:36.460" end="00:52:40.160">So, while I'm broken here I can hover of any variable I want</p>
      <p begin="00:52:40.160" end="00:52:45.860">and see all the details just like I would if it was running locally.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:45.860" end="00:52:52.850">You can step overusing f ten I can see and fact not going to look at data for that.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:52.850" end="00:52:54.880">I can inspect this image.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:52:59.480">I can say from the type of jpeg image file I can see all the information that I couldn't...before without the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:59.480" end="00:53:04.390">package installed but now because on live debugging on a remote machine...sending back all the information</p>
      <p begin="00:53:04.390" end="00:53:11.030">and asking for to see what's going on in my code you.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:11.030" end="00:53:18.990">For...spin background the...can say that it got the blob did the first one.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:18.990" end="00:53:23.550">And, in fact it's also displaying the output here so everything...screen it's going to display</p>
      <p begin="00:53:23.550" end="00:53:30.690">writing visual studio there's no need to be switching back and forth to the original process.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:30.690" end="00:53:35.210">Now as a step through this is doing image processing and as a few steps involved so maybe I want to look</p>
      <p begin="00:53:35.210" end="00:53:39.610">at the image at some various points along the way I'm just perform the</p>
      <p begin="00:53:39.610" end="00:53:48.190">crop so now I m is crop but another way to look at image until we get to this code that's going to save it.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:48.190" end="00:53:51.320">So, what I'm going to do with this code instead of waiting is I'm going to copy it</p>
      <p begin="00:53:51.320" end="00:53:57.360">and open what we call the debug interactive windows so under debug windows python debug interactive?</p>
      <p begin="00:53:57.360" end="00:54:02.280">And, this is a...</p>
      <p begin="00:54:02.280" end="00:54:06.830">I need to...is a...show where I can write arbitrary python code</p>
      <p begin="00:54:06.830" end="00:54:17.420">such as let's say this startup to buy player and then put into a blog.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:17.420" end="00:54:22.240">I can get the...I can make the blob url.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:22.240" end="00:54:26.750">Target container same name and this will show me this is where it's gone ahead</p>
      <p begin="00:54:26.750" end="00:54:30.170">and put the partially process photo if I open that up</p>
      <p begin="00:54:30.170" end="00:54:36.190">...say it's a nice big photo because that's what side of that but it's been...</p>
      <p begin="00:54:36.190" end="00:54:38.520">If I come back to this scripting continue</p>
      <p begin="00:54:38.520" end="00:54:41.220">...so let's stepped over the filter now we</p>
      <p begin="00:54:41.220" end="00:54:46.050">filter the image so I can come back up here rerun this bit of code which is going to</p>
      <p begin="00:54:46.050" end="00:54:53.780">take the image now live put it back up on the blob storage...same name.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:53.780" end="00:55:02.150">And, I may have just messed that up by hitting the wrong refresh button.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:02.150" end="00:55:10.220">And, I think that's been enhanced.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:10.220" end="00:55:15.960">Both come background we should have the...this probably.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:15.960" end="00:55:24.570">...process so let's try that one again with the next image.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:24.570" end="00:55:28.120">So, crop well-run the filter.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:28.120" end="00:55:35.970">Narrow to photo disdain.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:35.970" end="00:55:39.250">So, we've put this into thumbs...for fifteen.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:39.250" end="00:55:41.130">Which will be the edge enhanced version</p>
      <p begin="00:55:41.130" end="00:55:47.640">it's also this rotated sideways version that's actually a staircase?</p>
      <p begin="00:55:47.640" end="00:55:52.610">Resize step and now we can run the same code again.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:52.610" end="00:55:56.940">And,...refresh it's been resize so we're actually interfering with the program</p>
      <p begin="00:55:56.940" end="00:56:01.900">...executing arbitrary code on the remote machine part way through a program running this is a great</p>
      <p begin="00:56:01.900" end="00:56:06.860">way to be able to figure out what's wrong with code without actually having to sit on the linux box itself or</p>
      <p begin="00:56:06.860" end="00:56:20.630">sachin toward and work through everything step-by-step they don't have any questions about that from of on.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:20.630" end="00:56:26.110">So, the question is effectively is this running in the same environment so that's why I can just pick up</p>
