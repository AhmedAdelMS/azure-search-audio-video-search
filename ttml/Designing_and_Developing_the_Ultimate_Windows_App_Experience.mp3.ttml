      <p begin="00:04:39.740" end="00:04:45.240">well now what is the actual sample what is what's entailed it's basically a</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.240" end="00:04:48.530">...app...edge that you can leverage</p>
      <p begin="00:04:48.530" end="00:04:52.330">and use and ideally it's really just make it easier for you</p>
      <p begin="00:04:52.330" end="00:04:59.240">to build on easier to get started which basically means that it</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.240" end="00:05:03.760">...you time so you can get to market faster and ultimately</p>
      <p begin="00:05:03.760" end="00:05:08.710">it means you can create the amazing experiences you really want to and it's not</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.710" end="00:05:13.940">just for one group it's actually created for designers as well as</p>
      <p begin="00:05:13.940" end="00:05:20.170">our developers and we wanted to be for everyone all creators throughout the world?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:20.170" end="00:05:23.060">So, what is actually included in?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23.060" end="00:05:28.390">The first...go through the...primary patterns that jeff and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:28.390" end="00:05:33.290">...illustrated before while we're going to focus on just one today</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.830" end="00:05:39.520">I want to let-you know that we are working on trying to creepy samples for each one of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:43.200">these so in the future...able to leverage all of them across all devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:44.280" end="00:05:47.060">So, today we're going to focus on the hub is</p>
      <p begin="00:05:47.060" end="00:05:52.120">are primary control throughout the entire media sample?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52.120" end="00:05:54.950">Nowit's one of my favorite controls and the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:54.950" end="00:05:59.800">reason why is because it has a wonderful flexibility and,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:59.800" end="00:06:04.490">it's not just one-in-one orientation but to...previously before we had in just</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.490" end="00:06:09.550">...you know,...and be able, you know, kind of panned through but,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.550" end="00:06:13.780">after getting much feedback from a lot of different groups we actually</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.780" end="00:06:18.390">create with a secondary orientations getting even more flexibility in capability as far as</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.390" end="00:06:23.640">what you want actually leverage for your application in addition to that we also have</p>
      <p begin="00:06:23.640" end="00:06:29.000">big into it in the section...that you also have panning</p>
      <p begin="00:06:29.000" end="00:06:34.030">inc so, for example, a vertical model that would have scrolling you can have horizontal panning</p>
      <p begin="00:06:34.030" end="00:06:38.420">inc and vice versa if you're in horizontal kind of a page</p>
      <p begin="00:06:38.420" end="00:06:45.610">layouts so gives you even more flexibility as far as where you...actually take it beyond that.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.610" end="00:06:48.320">In the sample itself there's four primary pages</p>
      <p begin="00:06:48.320" end="00:06:51.670">...included...being home.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:51.670" end="00:06:53.020">Gallery.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:53.020" end="00:06:56.780">Details and also the media transfer control or as</p>
      <p begin="00:06:56.780" end="00:07:01.480">I like to call mtc just something I've learned to...the time so if you hear me say that</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.480" end="00:07:05.100">the relatively transfer control.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.100" end="00:07:10.660">It also am is included in the sample rtwelve controls which are the hub the list</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.660" end="00:07:14.680">...view the push buttonmedia transfer control grid</p>

      <p begin="00:07:23.320" end="00:07:26.780">So, now we're going to like literally...the term kindness</p>
      <p begin="00:07:26.780" end="00:07:34.940">...the hiding take a look at what...actually the sample consist of.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:34.940" end="00:07:35.610">Ok,</p>

      <p begin="00:07:44.780" end="00:07:49.450">...defines in a clear what the actual app is</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.450" end="00:07:54.260">after a long of research and looking around...different app models and how they're handling stuff</p>

      <p begin="00:08:19.660" end="00:08:24.150">If we take a deep...really look at what it actually has included in the page</p>
      <p begin="00:08:24.150" end="00:08:26.740">there's the split seo course inc...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:27.810" end="00:08:33.250">We have list views both in horizontal and vertical.</p>

      <p begin="00:47:14.160" end="00:47:16.480">So, we hit the break points.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:25.730">Me get to it.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:25.730" end="00:47:28.530">So,...debate point so here's the add the javascript</p>
      <p begin="00:47:28.530" end="00:47:34.670">...window images clear all this alps.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:34.670" end="00:47:39.440">...f ten I do feed up's.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:42.940">So, I think that's kind of cool javascript is images code</p>
      <p begin="00:47:42.940" end="00:47:47.810">...run in the app it's pretty awesome...by the way I'm a huge...guy allows</p>
      <p begin="00:47:47.810" end="00:47:51.540">...of windows phone for three years I did sample for excise</p>
      <p begin="00:47:52.550" end="00:47:56.070">...the...a few books on top of to so</p>
      <p begin="00:47:56.070" end="00:48:00.370">...and csharp it's awesome we will have this for that version but I would this one</p>
      <p begin="00:48:00.370" end="00:48:04.740">...this particular sample...little far along in terms of this architecture so that's I'm showing</p>
      <p begin="00:48:04.740" end="00:48:08.740">to javascript but it's always good the see more so,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:08.740" end="00:48:15.310">here's a feed data if I dump it into the javascript consul.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:15.310" end="00:48:18.100">You'll see it's an array of nodes I can expand</p>
      <p begin="00:48:18.100" end="00:48:23.490">...I can see what I'm what I'm getting back here what I'm going to if I...down</p>
      <p begin="00:48:23.490" end="00:48:27.510">...is...rss feed parse out as a node so what I'm going to do</p>
      <p begin="00:48:27.510" end="00:48:31.930">...if I if I scroll up on the data provider just</p>
      <p begin="00:48:31.930" end="00:48:36.590">a little bit you'll see the movie section of the data provider has</p>
      <p begin="00:48:36.590" end="00:48:40.310">a data model declared what happens is I call the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:40.310" end="00:48:45.220">rss feed I get the fourteen items from the are...feedback</p>
      <p begin="00:48:45.220" end="00:48:51.030">...bellicose ninety-nine art...I did the...so we get the ffourteen adders for the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:51.030" end="00:48:57.950">are says feedback each item is the little said chunk of</p>
      <p begin="00:48:58.970" end="00:49:01.570">And, what I do is with the data model that's</p>
      <p begin="00:49:01.570" end="00:49:05.730">...here for each item the data model is applied to that item</p>
      <p begin="00:49:05.730" end="00:49:10.660">with that item does it takes the it takes the xml it</p>
      <p begin="00:49:10.660" end="00:49:14.600">turns it into json since we have a sort of standard</p>
      <p begin="00:49:14.600" end="00:49:19.020">json data model if you will that we use in media template</p>
      <p begin="00:49:19.020" end="00:49:24.520">...up features for the platform for different platforms so we do is</p>
      <p begin="00:49:24.520" end="00:49:29.110">you convert your...you use a data...convert your</p>
      <p begin="00:49:29.110" end="00:49:34.280">feed information into this data model that runs within the app...the ideas...</p>
      <p begin="00:49:34.280" end="00:49:39.210">sort of light up like...controls on xbox one as we do today on xbox want</p>
      <p begin="00:49:39.210" end="00:49:44.870">to bring that forward to universal...platform?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:44.870" end="00:49:53.310">a will now open up the data model for movies</p>
      <p begin="00:49:53.310" end="00:49:58.310">Notice I having touched a page yet just remember that I showed you...demo I showed you what</p>
      <p begin="00:49:58.310" end="00:50:05.910">it does haven't...page yet so I'm going to go into the are there data models?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:05.910" end="00:50:08.250">And, I will.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:08.250" end="00:50:09.540">Scroll up to description</p>
      <p begin="00:50:10.610" end="00:50:14.170">...going to separate point here so we think of vita on when you see hit this</p>
      <p begin="00:50:14.170" end="00:50:18.630">break point when I when I run I hate to break point this is one of those fifteen</p>
      <p begin="00:50:18.630" end="00:50:27.170">...items some anurag clear this out again.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:27.170" end="00:50:30.050">And,...going to don t item into.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:30.050" end="00:50:34.340">The javascript x expand the edge of consul.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:34.340" end="00:50:38.780">...scroll up you see descriptions right there so it's...coded up file write-up</p>
      <p begin="00:50:38.780" end="00:50:42.700">...line-item say query</p>
      <p begin="00:50:42.700" end="00:50:48.670">selector and then I'll just throw in description in air.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:48.670" end="00:50:51.250">And, let's see we get back so...get back to get</p>
      <p begin="00:50:51.250" end="00:50:55.520">back to the chunk of xml I don't want the angle brackets...so I</p>
      <p begin="00:50:55.520" end="00:51:00.250">...get rid of that somebody's go ahead and then triad text contact...type</p>
      <p begin="00:51:00.250" end="00:51:06.870">...see what's available I have the text content...</p>
      <p begin="00:51:06.870" end="00:51:11.100">And, I don phillips.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:11.100" end="00:51:15.170">I forgot those pesky periods...now let me jump this and now I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:51:15.170" end="00:51:20.000">kind of where I'm at I got the description...now still not perfect I probably want to parse out the</p>
      <p begin="00:51:20.000" end="00:51:23.140">p tag for the new and html system parsing</p>
      <p begin="00:51:23.140" end="00:51:28.450">...field but you get the idea so that's with essentially the data model does</p>
      <p begin="00:51:28.450" end="00:51:33.660">a little more complex for images sort-of so it's in our...of it may not have a thumb a</p>
      <p begin="00:51:33.660" end="00:51:38.140">very size for every item xyz...web...so for the featured image</p>
      <p begin="00:51:38.140" end="00:51:43.980">which is the big image that you see on the featured page or the carousel you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:43.980" end="00:51:48.870">we try to use a...image possible so again...just a little query selectors to get in there but</p>
      <p begin="00:51:48.870" end="00:51:53.200">not really super important other...that all I'm doing is taking xml</p>
      <p begin="00:51:53.200" end="00:51:58.020">...into this standard json model and that's all I do to get this to work</p>
      <p begin="00:51:58.020" end="00:52:02.910">there's no other coding require why the reason why is...just stick to our...</p>
      <p begin="00:52:02.910" end="00:52:07.820">are metadata model if you follow that pattern then everything just...and has a touch any</p>
      <p begin="00:52:07.820" end="00:52:12.450">the pages on a to get into any the code on...pages kind of just gated working</p>
      <p begin="00:52:12.450" end="00:52:30.790">and then once you have a working from there you make it the best experience on the platform?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:30.790" end="00:52:34.200">So, call-to-action.</p>

      <p begin="00:52:46.430" end="00:52:51.140">surveys we indicated earlier and there and I'm going backwards which is fine and,</p>

      <p begin="00:53:28.820" end="00:53:32.630">So, the samples were still building them as you probably notice</p>
      <p begin="00:53:32.630" end="00:53:36.080">there definitely a ui...haven't met the ...</p>
