      <p begin="00:06:46.520" end="00:06:49.900">Configuration that you can expected to find.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.900" end="00:06:52.520">In a and in a scenario where you're</p>
      <p begin="00:06:52.520" end="00:06:57.450">using an active application and specifically what you have it here is...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57.450" end="00:07:03.610">your...and...resource that you want to access the idea is that the in visa</p>

      <p begin="00:07:41.880" end="00:07:47.990">So, what does it take to actually make calls to yadda</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.200" end="00:07:51.940">...system let me see geeks...</p>
      <p begin="00:07:53.200" end="00:07:54.670">All my stuff.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.670" end="00:07:59.590">Okay, normally how does it work your application...access to of that resource</p>
      <p begin="00:07:59.590" end="00:08:04.150">that resources expects it your application to present something to prove that</p>
      <p begin="00:08:04.150" end="00:08:08.960">...boxes...something is typically...access docket so there a number of things</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:12.340">with your application needs to perform one thing</p>
      <p begin="00:08:12.340" end="00:08:14.080">...for example.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:19.200">Manage to pop out some...experience select the user can</p>

      <p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:34.160">this so you application must be capable of popping we stuff out.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.160" end="00:08:38.570">And, then once you've done vector you need to be able to crafted in message</p>
      <p begin="00:08:38.570" end="00:08:43.510">for the place it from where you are authenticated users and in this</p>

      <p begin="00:27:24.520" end="00:27:28.060">And, them so here I'm already using the tokens so let me go</p>
      <p begin="00:27:28.060" end="00:27:33.450">a bit higher just to show you how ie obtain this...</p>
      <p begin="00:27:33.450" end="00:27:35.960">So, as I described earlier.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:35.960" end="00:27:39.720">Here there is a call...they do fatah obtaining my</p>
      <p begin="00:27:39.720" end="00:27:44.160">provider first thing I do is I want a web account provider to which</p>
      <p begin="00:27:44.160" end="00:27:49.960">I can ask it...for and the way which I do...is...I specify.</p>

      <p begin="00:28:03.070" end="00:28:07.770">Then once and that I create a web token request.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:07.770" end="00:28:10.640">And, here what I'm passing pretty simply</p>
      <p begin="00:28:10.640" end="00:28:14.160">is vague identifier of my application</p>
      <p begin="00:28:15.380" end="00:28:19.070">...with a added to my.</p>

      <p begin="00:28:39.870" end="00:28:43.690">And, then I do a couple of things that are ad specific.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:44.740" end="00:28:46.000">Which?</p>
