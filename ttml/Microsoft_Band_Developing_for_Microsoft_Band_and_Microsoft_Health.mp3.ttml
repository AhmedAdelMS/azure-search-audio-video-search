      <p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:00:59.650">...how many of us developers like to write applications that nobody wants to...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.650" end="00:01:01.920">You how many of us wish</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:07.650">...that absolute just sit in the uses apple there's an get new engagement from the users.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.650" end="00:01:11.450">Now how many would change your answer if the user actually paid for the app and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.450" end="00:01:13.340">lots of money moi.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.900" end="00:01:18.680">Bunch agree...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.680" end="00:01:22.410">The reality is I don't it's not surprising...are very few things</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.410" end="00:01:26.560">...more satisfying for developer the knowing that their product is being</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.560" end="00:01:31.170">engaging for the users...giving them value.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:31.170" end="00:01:35.020">The more, you know, about the user the more you can give them value the more,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.020" end="00:01:40.720">you know, and, understand how you can provide more...with so many applications competing for the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.720" end="00:01:43.920">...attention on the phone it's a big challenge</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.250" end="00:01:50.410">...up and get your...shine through.</p>

      <p begin="00:02:26.770" end="00:02:31.690">sixty-minutes how many of us here have a mike sub-band.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.690" end="00:02:37.150">...brilliant create so that remiss the first part is</p>

      <p begin="00:02:40.840" end="00:02:45.960">...just give you an overview of the cool technology because people are going to be watching this afterwards as well all the features that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:45.960" end="00:02:50.520">...built then we're going to talk about how us developers can engage with</p>
      <p begin="00:02:50.520" end="00:02:53.400">...and...of health.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.400" end="00:02:59.670">In-between tony's going-to helping you some demos and at the end will have some time for question-and-answer.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.670" end="00:03:01.730">So, what is mike subband?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.730" end="00:03:06.570">...is and all the available device which was build with a few key principles in mind.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:06.570" end="00:03:09.080">...designed to give you features that are going</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.080" end="00:03:13.720">...that...going to help you live healthier is also designed to help you</p>
      <p begin="00:03:13.720" end="00:03:19.850">be more productive and keep you connected at a glance without having to reach free-form throughout the day.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:19.850" end="00:03:25.310">These challenges coupled...the challenges of making something that is flexible and assist</p>
      <p begin="00:03:25.310" end="00:03:28.200">...factor and is all the available result</p>
      <p begin="00:03:28.200" end="00:03:34.400">in a product there is a combination of advanced technology and great engineering?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:39.020">...sub-band has ten sensors...into very small form factor.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.020" end="00:03:42.240">It also has a full-text display and it has...optimize</p>
      <p begin="00:03:42.240" end="00:03:48.070">...battery life to give you over two days of normal use on a single charts.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:48.070" end="00:03:52.280">Let's talk a little bit about the features of mike sub-band.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52.280" end="00:03:57.030">Microsoft when is far beyond your average run-of-the-mill step tracker what makes mike</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.030" end="00:04:02.010">subband unique is that it calculates your activity level your heartened metrics as well as</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02.010" end="00:04:06.740">you sleep patents to give you a holistic picture of your health and fitness how does</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.740" end="00:04:08.530">it do that so it starts</p>
      <p begin="00:04:08.530" end="00:04:13.110">...tracking is steps calories runs workouts and all the other exercises that you</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.110" end="00:04:17.270">...today and you go to sleep...tracks your sleep durations</p>
      <p begin="00:04:17.270" end="00:04:22.630">...and things like resting heart rate to understand more about fiercely.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:22.630" end="00:04:27.590">And, while...does all of that in the background with guided activities and custom activities</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.590" end="00:04:31.040">mike sub-band proactively taylor's your fitness of...to your needs</p>
      <p begin="00:04:31.040" end="00:04:37.850">and goals and essentially acts like a fitness...on your wrist.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.850" end="00:04:41.780">Productivity and connectivity are pillars that drive all the user engagement with the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.780" end="00:04:42.280">microsoft.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:43.360" end="00:04:44.830">What makes...subband unique</p>
      <p begin="00:04:44.830" end="00:04:49.390">...this front is that gives you the right amount of information and it gives you</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.390" end="00:04:51.430">...the most?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.430" end="00:04:53.620">So, things like incoming calls.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53.620" end="00:05:00.260">...social media updates nearby weather's keep you connected to things that you care about the most.</p>

      <p begin="00:05:03.760" end="00:05:07.560">what to do and way to be even when you're on the move?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:07.560" end="00:05:14.490">And, if you are user windows we bring...which is...personal system right on your...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:14.490" end="00:05:15.980">All the data collected by</p>

      <p begin="00:05:20.330" end="00:05:25.100">graphs and charts and trends that give you a detail view of your health.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:25.100" end="00:05:29.730">Those charts and graphs combined with the on banned features that we just talked</p>
      <p begin="00:05:29.730" end="00:05:30.650">about</p>
      <p begin="00:05:30.650" end="00:05:38.230">we feel that...and...give you a holistic solution for health fitness and...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.230" end="00:05:41.280">So, there was a bit about...of...of health.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:45.450">And, while these features a great and...first part experiences that sell a lot...lots of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.450" end="00:05:50.230">...and drive a lot of using in with the...event I wouldn't be standing here if that's all</p>
      <p begin="00:05:50.230" end="00:05:53.020">everyday soon after we should...sub-band</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.020" end="00:05:57.790">...health recite looking in ways in which...bring third-party developers to, come</p>
      <p begin="00:05:57.790" end="00:06:04.270">on, board engage with...microsoft so today we're going to talk about all the different reasons you can...the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.270" end="00:06:09.260">...because system I'm going to start off by the first offering in this space.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.260" end="00:06:12.270">Which is the...of ns...the purpose of the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:12.270" end="00:06:16.980">mike subband instigate is to open of the mike sub-band to third-party developers to extend</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.980" end="00:06:22.030">enhanced experience of the applications with the...event?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:22.030" end="00:06:26.290">So, essentially in a nutshell what the mike sub-band sdk does like all the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:26.290" end="00:06:30.860">...it basically asked xtwo communication protocol between the phone and the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:30.860" end="00:06:35.770">band and exposes...as a programming object so as developers all you need to</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.770" end="00:06:38.510">do is dropping a few namespaces create a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:38.510" end="00:06:43.440">...client and usually google once you do have a...client.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:43.440" end="00:06:48.270">There are a few main reason...you can interact with the...event you can stream data from the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:48.270" end="00:06:51.500">...events answers you can also create your own tile and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:51.500" end="00:06:53.990">...content into those tiles and you can also</p>
      <p begin="00:06:53.990" end="00:06:58.160">...personalizing customize the...subband...going to talk today about all</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:01.970">of those things in more detail in a little bit but before that I want to make</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.970" end="00:07:06.600">...one big important point like all or most of the variables in</p>
      <p begin="00:07:06.600" end="00:07:12.580">this category...subband does not provide a hosted application platform...really means is</p>
      <p begin="00:07:12.580" end="00:07:17.150">it's and extensibility model so you always have to have an application running on the host</p>
      <p begin="00:07:17.150" end="00:07:23.390">and then you can use the mike...as a rich input device as well as an auxiliary display.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:23.390" end="00:07:25.990">So, let's talk about the first thing once you have a bank line</p>
      <p begin="00:07:25.990" end="00:07:30.110">...for things that you can do let's not offered sensors so...</p>
      <p begin="00:07:30.110" end="00:07:35.520">sub-band is the gay as we talk about michael...has ten sensors in a...form</p>
      <p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:39.470">...the...exposes access to those sensors encode.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:40.500" end="00:07:44.790">So, you can using the...sub-band client...actually subscribe to the senses...as</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44.790" end="00:07:48.550">...call them...subscribe to a...stream...to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:48.550" end="00:07:52.700">...invoke all backs back into your code whenever there's new data available in those</p>
      <p begin="00:07:52.700" end="00:07:58.140">things some of the data that you get back is going to be...sensor data and some of this is going to be curator</p>
      <p begin="00:07:58.140" end="00:08:02.660">data that has been transformed onto the land to be more meaningful...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02.660" end="00:08:05.810">that's security data to get.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:05.810" end="00:08:09.240">Let's take a look at some of the sensors on the...screens in</p>
      <p begin="00:08:09.240" end="00:08:12.380">...so here's a table that talks about all the senses streams that</p>
      <p begin="00:08:12.380" end="00:08:18.430">...semantic expo I'm not going to talk about all of them but the table axis shows the kind</p>
      <p begin="00:08:18.430" end="00:08:23.310">...sensor that is behind that stream the...what would the data</p>
      <p begin="00:08:23.310" end="00:08:28.260">that comes back is provided from that...and what is the frequency of getting that data so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:28.260" end="00:08:33.510">if you look at the heart rate the value that comes back is the number of determinant which is the heart</p>
      <p begin="00:08:33.510" end="00:08:37.360">...of the...and it also gives...reading quality which means...the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:37.360" end="00:08:41.980">...is...on or whether...still in the process...the...to in the process of requiring that</p>
      <p begin="00:08:41.980" end="00:08:44.940">...reading any provide that back and one</p>
      <p begin="00:08:44.940" end="00:08:50.230">hertz which means once every second you get the data that some of the other senses like accelerometer and gyroscope give you</p>
      <p begin="00:08:50.230" end="00:08:54.550">...more frequently and they also provide you a way to actually</p>
      <p begin="00:08:54.550" end="00:09:00.540">change the frequency which wanted to get the data?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:00.540" end="00:09:05.070">A...must be connected when your streaming where streaming or bluetooth of course so if the blue</p>
      <p begin="00:09:05.070" end="00:09:09.970">...you know, your data...stop coming in some sense a require user</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.970" end="00:09:12.080">...authorization so if you're,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:16.220">you know, of flashlight application that silently tries to get the users...for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:16.220" end="00:09:21.280">the user actually has to authorize that app...go in and authorize...to get</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.280" end="00:09:26.240">...there are some there is some battery impact if you have longer in subscriptions because</p>
      <p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:30.310">we consuming bluetooth both on the on the phone site and...site but if you're running</p>
      <p begin="00:09:30.310" end="00:09:37.270">sensors for many hours you have to be careful that they will be some kind of a backing.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.270" end="00:09:39.030">So, I promise that tony's going to help us do some</p>
      <p begin="00:09:39.030" end="00:09:43.950">demos so this is the first one of the series of demos is going to show us how using the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:43.950" end="00:09:52.640">mike subband instigate you can create a band client and subscribe to a sensor.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:53.730">Okay,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.730" end="00:09:58.690">so, we'll start here in visual studio...get a new project</p>
      <p begin="00:09:58.690" end="00:10:02.780">started we're going to build simple application here</p>
      <p begin="00:10:02.780" end="00:10:04.340">...start off to streaming the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:04.340" end="00:10:10.510">heart rate some so good simple example of streaming some sensor data.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:10.510" end="00:10:13.560">We're going to draw the demos today in visual studio run this</p>
      <p begin="00:10:13.560" end="00:10:18.830">on windows phone we've got here we do release...sdk for all</p>
      <p begin="00:10:18.830" end="00:10:23.250">of the major platform so if you're android or ios developer you'd be using</p>
      <p begin="00:10:23.250" end="00:10:30.120">our native sdk for your platform and using your favorite development environment.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:30.120" end="00:10:34.140">So, we're going to start an as I do the demo today just because we've got a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:10:34.140" end="00:10:39.140">ground cover going to be dragging and some code snippet some not going to try to do a lot of typing on-the-fly</p>
      <p begin="00:10:39.140" end="00:10:43.990">just to help keep things moving here so we'll be working with</p>
      <p begin="00:10:43.990" end="00:10:48.830">a phone apps so let's make that are startup project and in the first thing I'll do is</p>
      <p begin="00:10:48.830" end="00:11:01.470">go grab the new get package for our sdk and we'll get that installed here.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:01.470" end="00:11:03.620">And, we'll just get the.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:03.620" end="00:11:07.560">Couple of dialogues here there we go.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:07.560" end="00:11:08.060">Ok.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:09.110" end="00:11:11.500">Now let's.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:11.500" end="00:11:16.910">Go drop...just a little bit of simple ui here.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:16.910" end="00:11:21.010">So, I'm just going to put a few controls on...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:21.010" end="00:11:26.100">Simple grid here.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:26.100" end="00:11:29.450">Okay, so, I've got a text field here...produce can put some</p>
      <p begin="00:11:29.450" end="00:11:33.920">status matches messages so we can see what's going on in the app got a couple of buttons</p>
      <p begin="00:11:33.920" end="00:11:38.740">...we used to start and stop the streaming of the heart rate data and then I've got another text</p>
      <p begin="00:11:38.740" end="00:11:43.260">block down here we'll put the data as we get back from the band</p>
      <p begin="00:11:43.260" end="00:11:50.100">ok so that's our simple ui let's go over the code here.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:50.100" end="00:11:51.870">And, first I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:11:51.870" end="00:11:57.200">droppings musing statements so you saw the namespaces</p>
      <p begin="00:11:57.200" end="00:12:02.090">...was mentioning earlier so we've got the...tiles tell pages...come to some</p>
      <p begin="00:12:02.090" end="00:12:06.950">...somewhere that later and, then the other really key thing is that</p>
      <p begin="00:12:06.950" end="00:12:11.590">band clients I'm going to make a private member here...this class and the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:11.590" end="00:12:16.240">...client is going to be essentially rr portal into the functionality the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:21.420">band and we'll see how we get that set up here so I'm going to do all of the...</p>
      <p begin="00:12:21.420" end="00:12:27.520">most of the logic here is just going to go right into our on navigated to method.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:27.520" end="00:12:35.170">I'm just going to remove those comments and drag and some code here.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:35.170" end="00:12:39.010">And, the first thing that we want to do is just identify the bands that we've got</p>
      <p begin="00:12:39.010" end="00:12:44.080">paired so we're going to numerator bans and select one to talk to.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:44.080" end="00:12:47.680">One thing I'll just mention here we're going to do all the initialization here on the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:47.680" end="00:12:52.960">first load of this page so if we come into here with a navigation...other</p>
      <p begin="00:12:52.960" end="00:12:58.540">the new we're just going to bail-out so we're just focusing on that on that one navigation</p>
      <p begin="00:12:58.540" end="00:13:04.710">mode the other thing I need to do here...make this a...</p>
      <p begin="00:13:04.710" end="00:13:09.220">Ok, so, now you can see here we're going to the client managerwe're getting that singleton</p>
      <p begin="00:13:09.220" end="00:13:11.400">instance and then we're just going to say get the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:11.400" end="00:13:16.060">...and do this asynchronous...so that's going to enumerate all of pared...normally</p>
      <p begin="00:13:16.060" end="00:13:21.290">you would only have one band paired with your device but the sdk actually supports any number of</p>
      <p begin="00:13:21.290" end="00:13:27.630">...you might want to have paired so ...demo purposes we're just going to get the first one</p>
      <p begin="00:13:27.630" end="00:13:31.840">...say first or default here and then for some reason we didn't recognize a</p>
      <p begin="00:13:31.840" end="00:13:36.730">banner didn't find one paired...just set the status and bail-out?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:36.730" end="00:13:41.190">Okay, so, the next thing we're going to do is actually make that connection to the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:41.190" end="00:13:45.440">band so I'm going to set the status message before and after so we can see what's</p>
      <p begin="00:13:45.440" end="00:13:48.980">going on here and then the key is that we're going to go back to that</p>
      <p begin="00:13:48.980" end="00:13:51.300">instance the singleton instance on the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:51.300" end="00:13:56.160">...client manager and just say connect and we're going to actually give it the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:56.160" end="00:14:00.460">...we identified previously so now we've got our</p>
      <p begin="00:14:00.460" end="00:14:04.940">band connection and the next thing that we want to do is get set up to receive that</p>
      <p begin="00:14:04.940" end="00:14:09.670">heart rate information and one of the things I'll show you here is how we deal</p>
      <p begin="00:14:09.670" end="00:14:14.450">with that authorization stepped...was talking about some...dragon a snippet of code and what</p>
      <p begin="00:14:14.450" end="00:14:19.290">will look at is how we check to see if we already have authorization and if not how we</p>
      <p begin="00:14:19.290" end="00:14:25.750">going to ask the user to get their permission to receive the heart rate data?</p>
      <p begin="00:14:25.750" end="00:14:29.290">...in here.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:29.290" end="00:14:31.160">The sdk remembers...you</p>
      <p begin="00:14:31.160" end="00:14:36.710">vast user once for their permission will actually remember that so you don't have to ask the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:36.710" end="00:14:41.880">user every time so the first thing that we're going to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:41.880" end="00:14:51.230">I must be...into the wrong place.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:51.230" end="00:14:55.940">So, the first thing we're going to do is go to the sensor manager under</p>
      <p begin="00:14:55.940" end="00:15:00.650">...band clients...reason that...client...band are going to go to the heart rate</p>
      <p begin="00:15:00.650" end="00:15:05.380">...specifically and then we're going to check the current consent setting</p>
      <p begin="00:15:05.380" end="00:15:07.980">ok so I'll just switch on that so if the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:07.980" end="00:15:12.780">users previously declined or granted permission then we have our answer and,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:12.780" end="00:15:17.380">...dab if this is the first-time here...</p>
      <p begin="00:15:17.380" end="00:15:21.710">We're actually going to go into the sensor manager again heart rate and now we're going</p>
      <p begin="00:15:21.710" end="00:15:26.700">to request consent so as we execute the app here in a moment you'll see this is going to pop-up</p>
      <p begin="00:15:26.700" end="00:15:30.850">stimuli or we ask for the consent in the user can either approve or</p>
      <p begin="00:15:30.850" end="00:15:34.600">disapprove that request.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:34.600" end="00:15:38.500">Ok, so, once we get out of that switch statement we've got our answer and if the user</p>
      <p begin="00:15:38.500" end="00:15:40.310">has given us consent.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:40.310" end="00:15:45.770">Then we want to go set-up and event handler to respond to that information as a starts</p>
      <p begin="00:15:45.770" end="00:15:50.610">to come in so again we go back to the sensor manager the heart rate sensor and...going to set</p>
      <p begin="00:15:50.610" end="00:15:55.240">up or of handler for this reading...and it's going to be and asynchronous</p>
      <p begin="00:15:55.240" end="00:16:00.790">handler and all we're going to do here is just go back to the main thread and set</p>
      <p begin="00:16:00.790" end="00:16:05.750">that text field we looked at where we wanted to show the heart rate information and we're just going to</p>
      <p begin="00:16:05.750" end="00:16:09.000">...that format using both the quality and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:09.000" end="00:16:13.760">heart rate number so we'll see whether we're still acquiring</p>
      <p begin="00:16:13.760" end="00:16:19.910">...or whether we've actually gotten locked on to the users heart rate and then we'll see what the value...</p>
      <p begin="00:16:19.910" end="00:16:24.760">And, then just to for completeness here if we didn't get consent and we'll just note that in the status</p>
      <p begin="00:16:24.760" end="00:16:26.040">field.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:26.040" end="00:16:29.510">The only thing...here to do or put in some simple handlers for</p>
      <p begin="00:16:29.510" end="00:16:33.790">thosefor those buttons so we had the start and stop buttons there on the screen we</p>
      <p begin="00:16:33.790" end="00:16:39.410">saw so when we start reading the heart rate...we do is go back to the heart rate</p>
      <p begin="00:16:39.410" end="00:16:45.340">sensor and just say start reading a...return we can say stop.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:45.340" end="00:16:50.610">that's it we're ready to start the app up so I'll go select the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:50.610" end="00:16:54.170">device move fire that up so that's going to build.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:55.230" end="00:17:00.560">And, deploy and we'll see this come up over here on our phone</p>
      <p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:05.240">in just a moment what other showing you the...screen here because we're not doing anything with the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:05.240" end="00:17:09.800">...yet so we won't see anything happening over here.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:09.800" end="00:17:12.250">So, the app is coming up and you see it's connecting.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:13.400" end="00:17:16.660">Connected and now we go right into this authorization</p>
      <p begin="00:17:18.190" end="00:17:21.870">...that up so I'll.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:21.870" end="00:17:25.710">Do that and now we're ready to start reading my heart rate</p>
      <p begin="00:17:25.710" end="00:17:30.600">we'll see how stressed out I am during the demo here ...pretty good</p>
      <p begin="00:17:30.600" end="00:17:35.450">seventy five that's not bad and stan things are under control?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:35.450" end="00:17:42.590">if I wait a few seconds we should see that go from acquiring to locked.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:42.590" end="00:17:47.130">Improves the confidence that it has okay...are locked</p>
      <p begin="00:17:47.130" end="00:17:52.320">...ok, it's going up a little bit still...figured but my benchmark today</p>
      <p begin="00:17:52.320" end="00:17:58.510">...if I if I can get to this point under a hundred that's probably pretty good okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:58.510" end="00:18:08.820">Okay, so, that's part one and I'll turn it back over to...to tell you somewhere.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:08.820" end="00:18:13.140">So, that was about sensors as you saw that getting...data from</p>
      <p begin="00:18:13.140" end="00:18:17.420">...events sensors does not allow you or does not require you to create anything on the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:17.420" end="00:18:21.560">...event you can user application on the phone and it can just get stream data from the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:21.560" end="00:18:25.910">sensors and you can use that data...it...you want but if you want to use the...of</p>
      <p begin="00:18:25.910" end="00:18:29.540">...display as an observer display you would want to create tiles on your</p>
      <p begin="00:18:29.540" end="00:18:35.420">...you want to once...and content into those tiles so the mike sub-band as</p>
      <p begin="00:18:35.420" end="00:18:39.450">...you interact create interactive tiles on the microsoft so</p>
      <p begin="00:18:39.450" end="00:18:45.360">let's quickly talk about how to do that once you have a...client and you're ready and you connectivity like</p>
      <p begin="00:18:45.360" end="00:18:48.550">...your application can then go ahead and create one</p>
      <p begin="00:18:48.550" end="00:18:52.910">or more tiles so all you need to do in order to create a tile is you need to have</p>
      <p begin="00:18:52.910" end="00:18:58.000">and the dollywood and specify a couple of icons...uses to show up on the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:58.000" end="00:19:03.850">...event and that's it additionally if you want your app can actually have or your tile can have up to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:03.850" end="00:19:07.930">eight additional icons those icons will be used in pages so</p>
      <p begin="00:19:07.930" end="00:19:11.010">what are these pages when the user taps</p>
      <p begin="00:19:11.010" end="00:19:14.070">...your tile it goes into the content inside of that</p>
      <p begin="00:19:14.070" end="00:19:19.000">tile that content is represented to what we call pages italian have up to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:19.000" end="00:19:23.960">eight pages each one of these page has a view port of two forty five hundred six pixels</p>
      <p begin="00:19:23.960" end="00:19:28.650">it's vertically scrollable seo content can be cold inside of a single page vertically</p>
      <p begin="00:19:28.650" end="00:19:33.160">the user slice horizontally the user basically navigate between different pages so</p>
      <p begin="00:19:33.160" end="00:19:37.680">you can operate pages these pages how do you create these pages these pages can be created</p>
      <p begin="00:19:37.680" end="00:19:42.050">...is one of the ways to create them to genetic messaging notifications</p>
      <p begin="00:19:42.050" end="00:19:47.990">the other way is to create than using custom layouts so we'll talk about both of those innovate?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:47.990" end="00:19:51.730">Once you have event landing...connected to event client you can send notifications to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:51.730" end="00:19:56.650">microsoft that there are three major types of notifications the first one</p>
      <p begin="00:19:56.650" end="00:20:00.140">are messages that we just talked about in the previous slide...title in</p>
      <p begin="00:20:00.140" end="00:20:05.140">a body style notification so you basically take a bank language...into your tyler chose up the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:05.140" end="00:20:08.530">title the body the body scrollable vertically so that's a page</p>
      <p begin="00:20:08.530" end="00:20:13.160">...a very simple layout you can have up to eight messages sent there in the first in first out</p>
      <p begin="00:20:13.160" end="00:20:16.260">q when you send the ninth message the first one that...is just going to</p>
      <p begin="00:20:16.260" end="00:20:20.620">...so that...you can have a continuous stream of communication with the band</p>
      <p begin="00:20:20.620" end="00:20:24.960">from your applications that's one form of notifications sometimes you want</p>
      <p begin="00:20:24.960" end="00:20:27.520">to notifications which do not require you to</p>
      <p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:30.950">...or persist inside of a tile those</p>
      <p begin="00:20:30.950" end="00:20:35.230">...popper dialogues when you send a dialogue it shows up onto the mike subband</p>
      <p begin="00:20:35.230" end="00:20:37.760">...dismisses the dialogue the dialogue goes away and the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:37.760" end="00:20:42.820">uses basically never sees that again so that's just to inform the user of something that...immediately</p>
      <p begin="00:20:42.820" end="00:20:48.460">happen once it's gone it's gone forever sometimes it's even useful...notification without any</p>
      <p begin="00:20:48.460" end="00:20:52.490">ui so those are vibration alerts that you can use the sd allows you to send a</p>
      <p begin="00:20:52.490" end="00:20:56.200">predefined set of vibration types to inform the user of some</p>
      <p begin="00:20:56.200" end="00:21:01.750">...feedback that you want to get them or some activity or if you want to just get their attention without any us.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:01.750" end="00:21:04.140">So, right on the right inside agency some example of</p>
      <p begin="00:21:04.140" end="00:21:10.270">how this content shows up the other way to create pages inside of your tiles is to custom layouts</p>
      <p begin="00:21:10.270" end="00:21:14.650">so with messages all you get is a title in a body and the body has up to one sixty characters and</p>
      <p begin="00:21:14.650" end="00:21:19.410">...scrolls and that's it but if you want fine-grain control over the content shows up and what</p>
      <p begin="00:21:19.410" end="00:21:24.320">if you want to icons and images and buttons you want to use a custom layouts?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:29.190">So, when you d create a...event tile you can register up to five layouts each one of these</p>
      <p begin="00:21:29.190" end="00:21:34.620">layouts is can is...a tree it's an object model where you have container elements within those</p>
      <p begin="00:21:34.620" end="00:21:39.400">contain elements who can have other container elements or you could have content primitive elements that contain</p>
      <p begin="00:21:39.400" end="00:21:44.300">content at the end of all of this the container elements do not show up on the</p>
      <p begin="00:21:44.300" end="00:21:51.760">on the...the content element show up the content elements that you have?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:56.030">Yeah, so, the table right here shows you the container elements in the primitive elements</p>
      <p begin="00:21:56.030" end="00:21:58.100">container elements you can have low...scrolls</p>
      <p begin="00:21:58.100" end="00:22:04.550">...of three panels and the content elements could be text could be buttons...be bar codes it could be icons.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:04.550" end="00:22:09.260">All of these elements support positioning formatting and styling so...can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:22:09.260" end="00:22:15.370">...position each one of these elements on the page exactly where...you want them to.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:15.370" end="00:22:18.850">Here's a couple of examples on the right-hand side bottom these are built in the</p>
      <p begin="00:22:18.850" end="00:22:23.470">...use for some of the content the visual inside...like submit.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:23.470" end="00:22:28.070">Once you have a layout then you can use that layout to create a page...that page over the</p>
      <p begin="00:22:28.070" end="00:22:31.860">...so...actually has a addressing schema</p>
      <p begin="00:22:31.860" end="00:22:35.840">...every tile actually has its good every page inside...tile has its own</p>
      <p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:40.360">good and within the page every single element has its own element id</p>
      <p begin="00:22:40.360" end="00:22:46.170">so essentially when you have a tile do it you can create a page using a given layout and by once you</p>
      <p begin="00:22:46.170" end="00:22:50.610">have a layout you can specify the elements each one of the elements in the value of...the content that you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:22:50.610" end="00:22:55.640">...for those elements and that's how you create a page so-if the layout had three are</p>
      <p begin="00:22:55.640" end="00:23:00.470">...lines...icon all...to do is say okay I'm going to use this layout and then you specify your</p>
      <p begin="00:23:00.470" end="00:23:04.780">three text lines whatever lines want to show up you specify the index of the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:04.780" end="00:23:09.700">icon which is one of the nine or ten index that all the icons that you've created before and</p>
      <p begin="00:23:09.700" end="00:23:14.350">then you have a page once you have a page you add a page to your tile by specifying a page</p>
      <p begin="00:23:14.350" end="00:23:17.390">...if a page good already exist inside of your tile</p>
      <p begin="00:23:17.390" end="00:23:20.060">...essentially updating the contents of that page automate</p>
      <p begin="00:23:20.060" end="00:23:25.050">inline so if I centipede before but I now want to update that page I will create a</p>
      <p begin="00:23:25.050" end="00:23:28.520">new page with the same...and send that page over it will update the contents</p>
      <p begin="00:23:28.520" end="00:23:33.400">of that page if a good as a new one that means another page will get added to your dial</p>
      <p begin="00:23:33.400" end="00:23:35.920">again you can have operate pages once you send the...</p>
      <p begin="00:23:35.920" end="00:23:42.710">pages going to push the page the first very first page out of the...so you only have eight pages.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:42.710" end="00:23:46.810">When you have pages you can put like I said you can put buttons on these pages so you would want to</p>
      <p begin="00:23:46.810" end="00:23:49.010">know end-users interacting with those...so you've</p>
      <p begin="00:23:49.010" end="00:23:54.100">...deceive events back using the sd from these pages the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:54.100" end="00:23:58.410">ethically allows you to actually...three different major kinds of events that you can</p>
      <p begin="00:23:58.410" end="00:24:04.670">subscribe to these are pretty self-explanatory by the...the user open your tile you get a</p>
      <p begin="00:24:04.670" end="00:24:08.980">...that says the use...enter your tile the user...your tile you'll get a notification</p>
      <p begin="00:24:08.980" end="00:24:13.130">...the approaching the user has left...once...inside of your tile and</p>
      <p begin="00:24:13.130" end="00:24:18.730">he presses any of the buttons the code on your code will get events the event</p>
      <p begin="00:24:18.730" end="00:24:22.660">...button pressed with the id of the element idea of the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:22.660" end="00:24:28.430">button was pressed inside of a particular page so you'll know exactly which button expressed?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:28.430" end="00:24:33.010">Couple of things to remember here events...handle slightly differently</p>
      <p begin="00:24:33.010" end="00:24:37.000">per platform and that's kind of the limitation...you have to work with when you're working across</p>
      <p begin="00:24:37.000" end="00:24:40.700">platforms so on android, for example, we use broadcast intense.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:41.810" end="00:24:47.130">What that means is your app can be...it's not running because the app is a registered intent and</p>
      <p begin="00:24:47.130" end="00:24:53.020">...service can actually cause ...that...and get your core to execute on ios we</p>
      <p begin="00:24:53.020" end="00:24:57.410">use bluetooth low-energy custom characteristic essentially that gives us a</p>
      <p begin="00:24:57.410" end="00:25:02.420">little more flexibility when the app is not in the foreground even if it</p>
      <p begin="00:25:02.420" end="00:25:07.010">is a background as long as the app has an active connection to the band you can actually...this the called</p>
      <p begin="00:25:07.010" end="00:25:11.190">...on windows...direct communications which means the app</p>
      <p begin="00:25:11.190" end="00:25:16.050">called has to be actively running in order to received the call that say the...is not running and,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:16.050" end="00:25:21.410">some activities happen on the band right now there is no way for us to...called back...the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:21.410" end="00:25:27.710">...to the...however with windows tenuous windows platform we have this thing called</p>
      <p begin="00:25:27.710" end="00:25:32.320">...services those absences will allow non running applications just</p>
      <p begin="00:25:32.320" end="00:25:38.690">like on android to be able to invoked from the...event?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:38.690" end="00:25:43.720">So, let's quickly handover back to tony...going to show us how using the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:43.720" end="00:25:52.270">...as...you can create interactive...on the...open.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:52.270" end="00:25:53.200">Okay, so,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:53.200" end="00:25:58.120">we're going to go back to the same map and we'll just pick up where we left off and we're going to do now</p>
      <p begin="00:25:58.120" end="00:26:03.030">is create a custom tile and within our tile we're going to create one-page</p>
      <p begin="00:26:03.030" end="00:26:07.730">with custom layout and on that page were going to put to buttons</p>
      <p begin="00:26:07.730" end="00:26:12.320">...afloat panel with the horizontal orientation and then we'll just</p>
      <p begin="00:26:12.320" end="00:26:15.950">put one-button another button and...put and awfully able and one</p>
      <p begin="00:26:15.950" end="00:26:21.530">...on label...the other room and then we'll see how we can get events back from those.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:21.530" end="00:26:22.660">So, I'm going to dragon</p>
      <p begin="00:26:22.660" end="00:26:27.030">helper method here that's going to do most of the work for us.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:27.030" end="00:26:28.040">Okay,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.040" end="00:26:34.320">and, there's a lot of code here a little more code than we've looked at so far but I'll walk through this whole thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:37.700">First thing to notice that this code is designed to work whether it's the first</p>
      <p begin="00:26:37.700" end="00:26:42.180">...subsequent times through so you'll see you see that pop-up in</p>
      <p begin="00:26:42.180" end="00:26:45.180">the logic here the first thing we do is</p>
      <p begin="00:26:45.180" end="00:26:49.840">establish the goods for the tile and the page the next thing we</p>
      <p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:54.490">want to do is go to tile manager and get our current set of tiles</p>
      <p begin="00:26:54.490" end="00:26:58.750">now this is filtered by app so this is not looking at all the custom tiles that have been added this</p>
      <p begin="00:26:58.750" end="00:27:03.790">is just the ones that I've added myself so we could have added multiple tiles in this demo</p>
      <p begin="00:27:03.790" end="00:27:08.580">...only adding one so what I want to do here is just see have we already out</p>
      <p begin="00:27:08.580" end="00:27:13.370">of the tile to this to the spanned or not okay so again we're going to call first</p>
      <p begin="00:27:13.370" end="00:27:18.310">...default if we get null back in the tile that means we have no tile yet so we're going</p>
      <p begin="00:27:18.310" end="00:27:26.800">to go construct the tile and then send it to the band so walk through that here.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:26.800" end="00:27:29.200">So, the first thing we're going to do is make a</p>
      <p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:32.730">...panel that we can put those buttons inside.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:32.730" end="00:27:34.380">Case or constructing that we give</p>
      <p begin="00:27:34.380" end="00:27:39.210">...element id zero we're setting the rectangle to use a</p>
      <p begin="00:27:39.210" end="00:27:42.930">...the full usable area on the tile</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42.930" end="00:27:47.760">are orientations horizontal and we want to center that</p>
      <p begin="00:27:47.760" end="00:27:51.700">ok so now we can go start but some elements within that within that</p>
      <p begin="00:27:51.700" end="00:27:55.380">flow panel so we'll go to our elements collection animal at</p>
      <p begin="00:27:55.380" end="00:27:59.590">a text button and we'll give it a new element id one</p>
      <p begin="00:27:59.590" end="00:28:04.250">...sort of width here and we're going to set what color we want to be when that</p>
      <p begin="00:28:04.250" end="00:28:08.860">...and you can see one thing here we've got an extension method here on</p>
      <p begin="00:28:08.860" end="00:28:16.290">the color object so that we can convert that to up suitable object for use with the band.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:16.290" end="00:28:19.240">So, we'll skip down here you see we're adding a second button</p>
      <p begin="00:28:19.240" end="00:28:25.940">given a new element id but, basically the same thing going on there.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:25.940" end="00:28:28.850">So, now we're going to make</p>
      <p begin="00:28:28.850" end="00:28:33.770">are page layout and then we're going to set as the...object on the layout that's just going to</p>
      <p begin="00:28:33.770" end="00:28:38.600">be that flow panel that we made up above so now we've got our layout let's go make</p>
      <p begin="00:28:38.600" end="00:28:45.750">our tile...self-serving to...tile...give it our tile guid.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:45.750" end="00:28:47.950">And, the first thing we want to do is given a name so the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:47.950" end="00:28:51.860">name is important because when the user goes to the microsoft health</p>
      <p begin="00:28:51.860" end="00:28:56.010">...and they go into the manic tiles section on there what you'll see</p>
      <p begin="00:28:56.010" end="00:28:58.370">...at the bottom after all of the first party</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58.370" end="00:29:03.350">tiles you'll see a list of third-party tiles and this is how your tile will be identified in</p>
      <p begin="00:29:03.350" end="00:29:11.340">that list k and then we're going to set up to icons that we want to use for that.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:11.340" end="00:29:16.360">...so, now we've got our tile object it slowly made it's got it's layout we've added the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:16.360" end="00:29:20.150">layout here and now we can go to the tile manager and just say</p>
      <p begin="00:29:20.150" end="00:29:22.930">add tile can that's what's really,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:22.930" end="00:29:35.080">really doing the work to set that up.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:35.080" end="00:29:39.710">Now so that was all work that we wanted to the very first-time when we didn't have that tile</p>
      <p begin="00:29:39.710" end="00:29:45.240">there yet it all on every time that we run through this code we want to go</p>
      <p begin="00:29:45.240" end="00:29:48.860">...that page and provide the page its content so you notice</p>
      <p begin="00:29:48.860" end="00:29:52.820">in the layout we didn't have anything about the labels on those buttons so this is where</p>
      <p begin="00:29:52.820" end="00:29:57.630">that comes out so we're going to go to tell manager again...set pages a</p>
      <p begin="00:29:57.630" end="00:30:02.640">...we've got our tile good now we're going to make a new page data object</p>
      <p begin="00:30:02.640" end="00:30:07.460">and we say here's the good this says which page we're talking about</p>
      <p begin="00:30:07.460" end="00:30:12.680">zero says I want to use the first layout we only have one layout so,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:12.680" end="00:30:18.510">we're using that layout that's just the index and, now we want to pass a couple of objects</p>
      <p begin="00:30:18.510" end="00:30:23.650">that provide the content for the elements on there...so this is where we get to</p>
      <p begin="00:30:23.650" end="00:30:28.550">...labels so that's all the work that we need to do to create</p>
      <p begin="00:30:28.550" end="00:30:33.450">that tile now let's go back up into our on navigated to method and let's just</p>
      <p begin="00:30:33.450" end="00:30:37.560">flush that out with some code to first.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:37.560" end="00:30:41.940">Creator initialize that tile so that's the code that we just looked at now we're going to set up</p>
      <p begin="00:30:41.940" end="00:30:42.890">or event handlers.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:44.100" end="00:30:46.290">So, we've got...opened</p>
      <p begin="00:30:46.290" end="00:30:50.740">...anti button pressed events so for each one of those were just going</p>
      <p begin="00:30:50.740" end="00:30:55.920">...message into that status area that we were using before and,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:55.920" end="00:31:01.620">for the for the button event we're also going to reach into our</p>
      <p begin="00:31:01.620" end="00:31:04.350">...and get the element id so we can see which button</p>
      <p begin="00:31:04.350" end="00:31:09.150">...okay and then there's just one more thing we need to</p>
      <p begin="00:31:09.150" end="00:31:10.970">do go add the icons.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:12.260" end="00:31:19.150">Here so I'll just go grab those.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:19.150" end="00:31:20.400">And, those to our project.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:25.400" end="00:31:28.640">Ready to build that.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:30.410">Now you notice is the application comes up this</p>
      <p begin="00:31:30.410" end="00:31:34.360">time we won't have to ask the user for the heart rate permission because we did</p>
      <p begin="00:31:34.360" end="00:31:39.260">that already so we'll see it skipping that step this time.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:39.260" end="00:31:44.670">we get we get this dialog so we always asks user permission to add a tile</p>
      <p begin="00:31:44.670" end="00:31:50.240">...the icon is provided here so they can get a sense for what application is asking</p>
      <p begin="00:31:50.240" end="00:31:56.250">to do this and, you see the name of the tile...their...give permission and you see on the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:56.250" end="00:32:00.860">...sinking so we're pushing the p icons for the tile the</p>
      <p begin="00:32:00.860" end="00:32:03.200">layouts all that information is</p>
      <p begin="00:32:03.200" end="00:32:09.070">coming down here if I scroll to the far-right...smiley face that's my tile</p>
      <p begin="00:32:09.070" end="00:32:13.690">icon and as I open this up we'll see an open event here and</p>
      <p begin="00:32:13.690" end="00:32:17.950">...also see our custom content so we've got our on off button</p>
      <p begin="00:32:17.950" end="00:32:24.490">...we saw the tile open event and as I press...see the button,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:24.490" end="00:32:26.860">button events coming in?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:26.860" end="00:32:29.720">And, then we'll see the tile closed.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:29.720" end="00:32:33.610">So, now you can see, you know, we've kind of got all the tools we need in our toolbox now to start</p>
      <p begin="00:32:33.610" end="00:32:40.990">making some really really more compelling scenarios with the band.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:40.990" end="00:32:45.350">you know, as I was finishing up this demo...work, you know, a couple of weeks ago</p>
      <p begin="00:32:45.350" end="00:32:49.810">...was kinda cool, you know, we've showed you how to put all this together but, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:49.810" end="00:32:53.350">it's a little dry, you know, it's, you know, it's text on a display here</p>
      <p begin="00:32:53.350" end="00:32:59.030">we're just pressing some buttons and I thought it would be fun to do something a little more interesting with us so I</p>
      <p begin="00:32:59.030" end="00:33:01.860">email some folks and the io t space and said hey, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:01.860" end="00:33:06.860">what would be a good the could gadget we could maybe hook up to this and do something with</p>
      <p begin="00:33:06.860" end="00:33:10.530">and I learned about some of the work that we were doing with the folks from instilling on so there's</p>
      <p begin="00:33:10.530" end="00:33:15.810">an all join talk going on right now unfortunately where the scandal</p>
      <p begin="00:33:15.810" end="00:33:20.870">audience down folks are but, what I learned is that with their new hub this</p>
      <p begin="00:33:20.870" end="00:33:26.890">is their new home automation too they have a cloud api the instantiate api</p>
      <p begin="00:33:26.890" end="00:33:32.510">turns out that's really easy-to-use so in just a couple of hours with some sample code that the institute</p>
      <p begin="00:33:32.510" end="00:33:35.260">...me what I did was take</p>
      <p begin="00:33:35.260" end="00:33:39.690">that sample app and just extend a little bit so wrote a little client wrapper</p>
      <p begin="00:33:39.690" end="00:33:44.150">for their api I took the layout that we just looked at and I just</p>
      <p begin="00:33:44.150" end="00:33:49.920">added a text field on the top of it and then I added some code to go reach</p>
      <p begin="00:33:49.920" end="00:33:54.850">out to my home automation network and I've got to instantiates which</p>
      <p begin="00:33:54.850" end="00:33:58.230">modules here onstage small fire up this app?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:59.390" end="00:34:04.630">now we're going to authenticate within scion so I've got the credentials here for the networks that I set</p>
      <p begin="00:34:04.630" end="00:34:10.930">up and we're connects the band I'll go login to instill...</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.930" end="00:34:14.570">...see a found...found both my switches it knows the name so</p>
      <p begin="00:34:14.570" end="00:34:19.210">that's actually enumerating over this devices that we got back we've got the name and we</p>
      <p begin="00:34:19.210" end="00:34:23.320">pushed those device names down to tiles or</p>
      <p begin="00:34:23.320" end="00:34:27.200">...pages behind my tile here so you can see I've got my living room</p>
      <p begin="00:34:27.200" end="00:34:32.430">light in my bedroom light so that was all content that came dynamically through,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:32.430" end="00:34:34.170">through calling in stan.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:34.170" end="00:34:37.610">So,...turn assign there's, there's one...</p>
      <p begin="00:34:39.120" end="00:34:54.260">And, should there's the other one so...success?</p>
      <p begin="00:34:54.260" end="00:34:59.260">One thing tony didn't talk about was his life almost left him because he was standing on thanks in his bedroom</p>
      <p begin="00:34:59.260" end="00:35:05.540">on asf from is office throughout the day...great creature a little bit, yeah, okay,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:05.540" end="00:35:09.640">so, that was creating tiles and creating buttons and getting interactive stuff back from the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:09.640" end="00:35:14.030">likes event couple of things that we didn't talk about today in the interests of time a while talking</p>
      <p begin="00:35:14.030" end="00:35:17.790">about the educators...event...the also allows you to personalizing</p>
      <p begin="00:35:17.790" end="00:35:21.280">...sub-band...of things that we do allow you to customize our the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:21.280" end="00:35:25.000">...and the team color for the...scheme.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:25.000" end="00:35:30.000">Of what is the me tile the media is a main tile that shows up when you go into the into the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:35.760">...of...the use of...on the...of nsf...that you see so them using the...can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:35:35.760" end="00:35:40.660">get that metallic and also...do anything you like...lot of you probably are already using apps that</p>
      <p begin="00:35:40.660" end="00:35:45.510">actually doing this another thing is my some as six different colors that comprise microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:35:45.510" end="00:35:50.270">ranting using the as you can actually change that team and you can change the look and feel of the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:50.270" end="00:35:56.300">...the same theme is useful your application tiles so-if you want-to change the team of your particular</p>
      <p begin="00:35:56.300" end="00:36:02.420">tile and the different on the maintain you can use the same the same...class to do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:02.420" end="00:36:06.780">So, just to recap ...of an as you saw today that we can use</p>
      <p begin="00:36:06.780" end="00:36:11.780">...to get to access sensors you can use the...of as you to create your own tiles and send data in get</p>
      <p begin="00:36:11.780" end="00:36:16.830">events back from those and...we talked about how you can...might subband by using the</p>
      <p begin="00:36:16.830" end="00:36:20.500">...my semantic is currently available on developer</p>
      <p begin="00:36:20.500" end="00:36:26.080">...sub-band dot com it's available on windows android and ios it's in a preview</p>
      <p begin="00:36:26.080" end="00:36:30.610">where we're excited to bring it to you in a full released very soon.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:30.610" end="00:36:35.650">If you're and, if you're not...developer...for all different platforms and use</p>
      <p begin="00:36:35.650" end="00:36:39.770">said use examine be has eminent bindings for all of this negate the</p>
      <p begin="00:36:39.770" end="00:36:44.270">functionality have a portals last library that you can use and you can just target one</p>
      <p begin="00:36:44.270" end="00:36:50.090">...of api as and generate apps for all three platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:50.090" end="00:36:54.370">So, that was all about...event as began how you can write applications that can communicate with the</p>
      <p begin="00:36:54.370" end="00:36:58.020">...or what if you one of those developers who does not like to...apps</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.020" end="00:37:02.810">...doesn't want to write apps for the mobile platforms at all but if you have a service or</p>
      <p begin="00:37:02.810" end="00:37:07.580">what if you have someone who has content on the post on the internet and you want to bring that content on to the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:07.580" end="00:37:09.020">mikes on that?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:09.020" end="00:37:12.350">It really necessary to actually have an application running on the on</p>
      <p begin="00:37:12.350" end="00:37:16.360">a phone in the beginning I said you have to have an application running while that is</p>
      <p begin="00:37:16.360" end="00:37:21.420">...I never said that it has to be an application that you have to write so today</p>
      <p begin="00:37:21.420" end="00:37:24.920">...very excited to talk about and give you an early look into this thing that we</p>
      <p begin="00:37:24.920" end="00:37:29.850">working on which is what we call web-based mike subband...</p>
      <p begin="00:37:29.850" end="00:37:35.960">What essentially these are tiles that exist on you might...the powered by the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:35.960" end="00:37:38.800">The way we do it is the...</p>
      <p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:43.700">Is always accompanied by myself...that myself how that is present and all the platform that you're running a</p>
      <p begin="00:37:43.700" end="00:37:47.400">...event or...of bandwidth my somehow that allows my</p>
      <p begin="00:37:47.400" end="00:37:51.830">subband to be connected to the internet so we thought why not use the our of the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:51.830" end="00:37:56.500">...of health and use internet connectivity that provided by the...of held app and allow the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:56.500" end="00:38:00.020">...sub-band to get content from the internet I thought about a</p>
      <p begin="00:38:00.020" end="00:38:02.570">very different many different ways in which you could, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:02.570" end="00:38:06.400">talk about this but reality is the easiest way I could think</p>
      <p begin="00:38:06.400" end="00:38:09.600">of was imagine you have favorites on your web page or you</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09.600" end="00:38:14.450">have analysis feed that you really like to go and you want to see new content on it every day so this is</p>
      <p begin="00:38:14.450" end="00:38:19.230">...way of enabling mike sub-band to actually reach out and get content from the internet</p>
      <p begin="00:38:19.230" end="00:38:23.740">so what you have to do is you all you have to specify is the source of the content and</p>
      <p begin="00:38:23.740" end="00:38:29.050">you'd have to specify the...you...that condom to show up on the...event and let the microsoft help app</p>
      <p begin="00:38:29.050" end="00:38:34.290">connect the dots and do the rest for you so essentially it really brings what I'd like to</p>
      <p begin="00:38:34.290" end="00:38:37.720">...tiny browser on the mike subband before even freaks out</p>
      <p begin="00:38:37.720" end="00:38:41.670">is not project many spartan or anything like that this is just decorative</p>
      <p begin="00:38:41.670" end="00:38:49.100">way of bringing content from the internet without having to write any logic on any of the platforms?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:49.100" end="00:38:51.510">So, why you would want to do this?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:51.510" end="00:38:55.890">It lowers the value twenty of using...of n and leverage our of mike</p>
      <p begin="00:38:55.890" end="00:39:00.890">sub-band dramatically you don't have to write any apps you don't have to know...code you don't have</p>
      <p begin="00:39:00.890" end="00:39:05.840">...object...java csharp all you need to do is just understand some markup languages and you should be</p>
      <p begin="00:39:05.840" end="00:39:10.540">good to go another way to simple in portable you have your content already in the on the internet</p>
      <p begin="00:39:10.540" end="00:39:13.080">...just bringing into a new surface so that's</p>
      <p begin="00:39:13.080" end="00:39:17.890">very powerful and again this is one more way of you reaching your users</p>
      <p begin="00:39:17.890" end="00:39:21.330">...them in into content that you create.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:21.330" end="00:39:25.920">Who would be interesting into this developers already have content and they want to light up that content</p>
      <p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:31.110">...the...this is going to be powerful tools for them and also into used who liked</p>
      <p begin="00:39:31.110" end="00:39:35.820">...know exactly what content they want maybe they don't own that content but they still want to see that content on the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:35.820" end="00:39:41.390">...event...going...tools that is going to be very powerful for them quickly let me talk about what the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.390" end="00:39:45.720">...experience looks like so as a reptile author?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:45.720" end="00:39:49.030">The first thing you do is you would author your tile what does that authoring mean</p>
      <p begin="00:39:49.030" end="00:39:53.880">...means all you have to specify is where is this data source that you're interested in</p>
      <p begin="00:39:53.880" end="00:39:57.870">what are the layouts that...interested in...how do you want...data source to</p>
      <p begin="00:39:57.870" end="00:40:02.310">show up in that layout and that's what we call data mining so you ever data that's coming from the internet you have a</p>
      <p begin="00:40:02.310" end="00:40:06.670">layout that you've created and you want that layouts to somehow show that content</p>
      <p begin="00:40:06.670" end="00:40:12.630">you basically buying some of the parts that content using that layout...on the my sub-band once you've author</p>
      <p begin="00:40:12.630" end="00:40:17.440">dilution publisher...hosted you can storage however you wanted.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:22.140">You can...people you can use a social media e-mail or just send urls to share</p>
      <p begin="00:40:22.140" end="00:40:25.160">...this content and then let the microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:40:25.160" end="00:40:29.870">...app do the rest of the work for you and by the rest of the work I mean...of...</p>
      <p begin="00:40:29.870" end="00:40:34.800">scale of installing it also textile managing and make sure the data coming in into your tiles</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.800" end="00:40:38.510">all this fresh and is refresh...</p>
      <p begin="00:40:38.510" end="00:40:43.260">So, what is this reptile...that I keep mentioning it's basically a zip file format</p>
      <p begin="00:40:43.260" end="00:40:46.030">that we're exploring it has a</p>
      <p begin="00:40:46.030" end="00:40:50.930">couple mandatory things that you have to have a couple of optional things that you can add...do things are</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.930" end="00:40:55.800">the manifest file this is the file that talks about everything that you need to create a tile on the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:55.800" end="00:41:00.270">...events so describes your tile it also tells you where the data source for that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:00.270" end="00:41:05.260">...coming from it also contains a data bindings for the payload so, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:05.260" end="00:41:10.590">this is the data want to show and this is how I want to show it couple of...another thing that you want is you want</p>
      <p begin="00:41:10.590" end="00:41:16.170">image files because you creating a title mikes...then it has to like on those that icons for the images?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:16.170" end="00:41:17.950">If you want finer-grained controls often the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:17.950" end="00:41:21.980">...have custom layouts so you can have more granular control of the how</p>
      <p begin="00:41:21.980" end="00:41:26.230">the content shows up you could use some of the built-in layout slider title embody or</p>
      <p begin="00:41:26.230" end="00:41:30.670">some basically out-of-shape or you can have your own custom layout in the future you can imagine you can</p>
      <p begin="00:41:30.670" end="00:41:35.310">have javascript files which can use be used to do they meant handling for you and the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:35.310" end="00:41:40.610">...has...actually host tacked on your behalf and basically do all the work for you.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:40.610" end="00:41:45.360">...a concept there is much more easily understood...you see code since this is the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:45.360" end="00:41:52.830">...audience I'm going to start talking lesson that...little more of the demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:52.830" end="00:41:59.390">So, when we started thinking about this idea a lot of our thinking was kind of spurred on by some</p>
      <p begin="00:41:59.390" end="00:42:03.960">conversations we're having with...handsome and who you saw earlier today...the keynote doing some</p>
      <p begin="00:42:03.960" end="00:42:08.420">measure demos and I think he's here in the talkers as well and</p>
      <p begin="00:42:08.420" end="00:42:13.640">he had a really compelling, compelling scenario that we've kind of used to drive our thinking on this</p>
      <p begin="00:42:14.870" end="00:42:20.080">scott is diabetic and he wears a blood glucose monitor that is</p>
      <p begin="00:42:20.080" end="00:42:26.150">monitoring his blood glucose levels twenty four seven now that monitors connected to</p>
      <p begin="00:42:26.150" end="00:42:31.660">a device or phone I think that the pushes that up to asher so</p>
      <p begin="00:42:31.660" end="00:42:36.780">this is scott's live blood glucose data and</p>
      <p begin="00:42:36.780" end="00:42:41.280">scott had a band for a while when...we first talked...a few months ago and he said</p>
      <p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:45.010">what he would really love is to be able to get the same information</p>
      <p begin="00:42:45.010" end="00:42:49.480">right on his band and have it be kind of constantly refreshed and current</p>
      <p begin="00:42:49.480" end="00:42:53.610">...pulling apart phone out-of-pocket and going to look at that he's just got</p>
      <p begin="00:42:53.610" end="00:42:58.860">...really convenient way right there on his wrist so we took that idea</p>
      <p begin="00:42:58.860" end="00:43:04.520">and we've kind of built...demo around that?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:04.520" end="00:43:09.240">So, what I'll do is go look at a simple web tile that will do</p>
      <p begin="00:43:09.240" end="00:43:13.040">that for us so this is a directory where we're building the tiles</p>
      <p begin="00:43:13.040" end="00:43:15.410">organism this up in a moment but we've got</p>
      <p begin="00:43:15.410" end="00:43:21.150">an icons directory hereyou see we've got a couple of a blood droplet like</p>
      <p begin="00:43:21.150" end="00:43:28.750">icons and we've got our manifest so let's go look at the manifest?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:28.750" end="00:43:31.890">And, I'll go up to the top here.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:31.890" end="00:43:35.930">And, you can see there's some, you know, kind of boiler plate information that you'd expect to see here we've got</p>
      <p begin="00:43:35.930" end="00:43:40.900">a manifest version we've got a name for the tile longer description that we might want to</p>
      <p begin="00:43:40.900" end="00:43:45.500">shown in gallery if we were going to collect a bunch of tiles together and show them to</p>
      <p begin="00:43:45.500" end="00:43:48.870">userssome version information author</p>
      <p begin="00:43:48.870" end="00:43:54.430">and contact information and then we've got pointers to those icon so we've got an app icon</p>
      <p begin="00:43:54.430" end="00:44:00.490">...we might use on the phone or desktop to give us a nice rich representation</p>
      <p begin="00:44:00.490" end="00:44:05.260">of our tile and, then we've got, you know, the actual forty-six my forty-six</p>
      <p begin="00:44:05.260" end="00:44:07.850">tile that we want to use on the band itself.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:08.860" end="00:44:09.870">Okay,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:09.870" end="00:44:14.730">now the next thing that we have here is...section where we talk about resources sosa</p>
      <p begin="00:44:14.730" end="00:44:19.260">...saying this is where we talk about what we're going to reach out to the web</p>
      <p begin="00:44:19.260" end="00:44:24.270">...information from and you can see it's an array of objects so we could actually</p>
      <p begin="00:44:24.270" end="00:44:28.370">have multiple resources that were drawing from in this case we have one and</p>
      <p begin="00:44:28.370" end="00:44:33.740">we're going to do is go up to scots measure site he's got a site</p>
      <p begin="00:44:33.740" end="00:44:37.060">there that we can just do a get on and what we'll get back as a</p>
      <p begin="00:44:37.060" end="00:44:41.730">...payload with the information about his current</p>
      <p begin="00:44:41.730" end="00:44:45.640">...glucose status another style?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:45.640" end="00:44:48.740">Member here is interesting we're thinking about a number of different</p>
      <p begin="00:44:48.740" end="00:44:53.050">scenarios here solely was talking about...assessed speeds, for example, so,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:53.050" end="00:44:57.740">you might want to have a web tile where you're actually looking for</p>
      <p begin="00:44:57.740" end="00:45:03.410">new feed items to come in and just pulling off those new feed items in this case in</p>
      <p begin="00:45:03.410" end="00:45:07.950">scott's case what we have is a single static payload that's</p>
      <p begin="00:45:07.950" end="00:45:12.600">going to be changing I mean static in its format but the contents of that are going</p>
      <p begin="00:45:12.600" end="00:45:18.170">to be changing so we're calling that a simple style but,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:18.170" end="00:45:22.280">we envision a number of different styles to make it really, really easy to deal with</p>
      <p begin="00:45:22.280" end="00:45:24.850">common internet content scenarios.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:26.090" end="00:45:27.750">So, the next thing we want to do is reach</p>
      <p begin="00:45:27.750" end="00:45:32.150">in just pluck out the fields of that of that data that we're interested in so what we're</p>
      <p begin="00:45:32.150" end="00:45:37.230">going to do is to set up a binding from a name that we can use internally here</p>
      <p begin="00:45:37.230" end="00:45:42.950">and the manifest to an actual path into the content so here we're just, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:42.950" end="00:45:49.120">creating a json style expression there's a top-level object pcs</p>
      <p begin="00:45:49.120" end="00:45:54.360">there's an array and then...tv field is what's going to give us the current,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:54.360" end="00:45:56.120">current reading out of their</p>
      <p begin="00:45:56.120" end="00:46:01.520">similar similarly for the other fields here there's a time stamp that will tell us, you know, when</p>
      <p begin="00:46:01.520" end="00:46:09.350">was...this reading collected so, this gives us...that we need to popular tile?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:09.350" end="00:46:13.640">So, now the second half of that is how do we do we actually</p>
      <p begin="00:46:13.640" end="00:46:16.440">get that content down on to the page.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:17.660" end="00:46:22.610">we've got the pages section here and again you can see...an array of objects we get a multiple pages so we</p>
      <p begin="00:46:22.610" end="00:46:26.980">could be taken content from the web and then spreading that across as many pages as we</p>
      <p begin="00:46:26.980" end="00:46:32.550">like and this case we've got one page and we're going to use a built-in layout so we've got</p>
      <p begin="00:46:32.550" end="00:46:37.530">a built-in layout that are baptist understands natively and will document</p>
      <p begin="00:46:37.530" end="00:46:41.160">...set of these on this case we're going-to do is put, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:41.160" end="00:46:45.120">the thing that's got cares about most is what is my current blood glucose levels so</p>
      <p begin="00:46:45.120" end="00:46:49.330">we'll make that nice and big on the left side of the tile and then we'll show some of</p>
      <p begin="00:46:49.330" end="00:46:55.280">this other information in smaller text fields to the right so we know the element idea of this is</p>
      <p begin="00:46:55.280" end="00:46:59.550">one and then mobile do a set the value just by using this string</p>
      <p begin="00:46:59.550" end="00:47:04.840">substitution syntax we've got here so double curly says I want to go back to</p>
      <p begin="00:47:04.840" end="00:47:09.620">that named current that I bound earlier and just insert that here?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:09.620" end="00:47:14.940">...do the same thing for the direction which gives us a general trend indication</p>
      <p begin="00:47:14.940" end="00:47:19.690">and we've got the delta and now we're going to take, you know, the delta information that we got back from the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:19.690" end="00:47:25.800">web but also had some units of measurement here and then finally for the updated</p>
      <p begin="00:47:25.800" end="00:47:29.350">this is a little interesting so we've got some static text here</p>
      <p begin="00:47:29.350" end="00:47:32.130">...referring back to the time stamp but then we've got</p>
      <p begin="00:47:32.130" end="00:47:37.480">a helper here that says I want to take that unique style time stamp...it to</p>
      <p begin="00:47:37.480" end="00:47:42.720">our human friendly short time format so we'll have some set of these</p>
      <p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:47.700">two again help you deal with really common scenarios for data transform transformations</p>
      <p begin="00:47:47.700" end="00:47:50.840">that you might want to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:50.840" end="00:47:54.080">So, that's it it's really you can think of it is kind of a transducer</p>
      <p begin="00:47:54.080" end="00:48:02.270">between content on the web and the format that I want to see it in on my band.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:02.270" end="00:48:04.000">So,I'll.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:04.000" end="00:48:11.790">Just sit these up.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:11.790" end="00:48:13.340">And, then.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:13.340" end="00:48:17.550">I'll talk a little bit about this extension so...the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:17.550" end="00:48:23.490">extension to web tiles we have to mechanisms in the microsoft health up that help</p>
      <p begin="00:48:23.490" end="00:48:27.750">...this installation process of these web tiles really seamless so</p>
      <p begin="00:48:27.750" end="00:48:33.830">we're registering for the web tile file suffix we also are registering</p>
      <p begin="00:48:33.830" end="00:48:35.210">for a customer</p>
      <p begin="00:48:35.210" end="00:48:41.370">all scheme so you'll be able to create pages that maybe have a little band</p>
      <p begin="00:48:41.370" end="00:48:46.330">icon and, you know, you can make it easy for your users to go grab the content that</p>
      <p begin="00:48:46.330" end="00:48:50.910">you're providing to them put it on their band just by just by using a</p>
      <p begin="00:48:50.910" end="00:48:56.260">customer all scheme their refers to your ...web tile.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:56.260" end="00:48:58.600">So, what I'm going to do is I've made a</p>
      <p begin="00:48:58.600" end="00:49:03.480">one drive folder where I'm working on authoring these things and testing so I'm just going</p>
      <p begin="00:49:03.480" end="00:49:07.300">to copy this over to a short-cut here I've got for that?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:07.300" end="00:49:09.420">For that one drive folder.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:09.420" end="00:49:14.590">Ok, so, now...move over to the phone.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:14.590" end="00:49:18.280">And, I've got that same folder pinned to my</p>
      <p begin="00:49:18.280" end="00:49:22.880">start screen here small open that up.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:22.880" end="00:49:27.460">...there's my web tile and because we registered for that file</p>
      <p begin="00:49:27.460" end="00:49:31.640">suffix I can just open that.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:31.640" end="00:49:35.820">And, we launch right into microsoft health and it's going to go read the manifests</p>
      <p begin="00:49:35.820" end="00:49:42.540">now get the information from map and we'll see we'll get that same kind of.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:42.540" end="00:49:48.310">...were going to well.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:48.310" end="00:50:12.420">...start.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:12.420" end="00:50:23.300">Yeah, my harvard's I'm sure my harvard's...good thing we don't have the showing...that's.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:23.300" end="00:50:28.780">It's talking to the band.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:28.780" end="00:50:32.340">Okay,...in here I'll show you there's the third-party...we</p>
      <p begin="00:50:32.340" end="00:50:36.540">...before so the...demos the app that we added you can see the nc on</p>
      <p begin="00:50:36.540" end="00:50:49.250">demo so let's come back out of here let's try one more time.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:49.250" end="00:50:51.590">Serially this worked.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:51.590" end="00:50:58.600">Mirror minutes ago maybe have...time.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:58.600" end="00:50:59.580">Which...</p>
      <p begin="00:51:09.730" end="00:51:11.880">...that upon more time.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:11.880" end="00:51:13.180">...doing that,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:13.180" end="00:51:18.180">yeah, go ahead as if it's not obvious this is a technology that...are just working on right</p>
      <p begin="00:51:18.180" end="00:51:23.210">now...love to get your feedback on this there is there's a</p>
      <p begin="00:51:23.210" end="00:51:25.960">lot of creativity that we get from</p>
      <p begin="00:51:25.960" end="00:51:30.340">people's feedback from developers feedback this is one of those places that you can actually have your voices</p>
      <p begin="00:51:30.340" end="00:51:36.040">...so, please I'm going to talk about the ways in which you can contact us but,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:36.040" end="00:51:39.900">feel free after the after the session or even after will be in the windows inside</p>

      <p begin="00:51:44.710" end="00:51:49.510">us and...try to incorporate your feedback into this maybe one of the way</p>
      <p begin="00:51:49.510" end="00:51:52.060">...going to be make installation work better.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:53.920" end="00:52:02.380">If you have any ideas we could go ahead and start taking questions if you want to keep trying to get the skunk.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:02.380" end="00:52:11.440">Yeah, that's good and...questions...that.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:11.440" end="00:52:14.840">All right so trust me that...</p>
      <p begin="00:52:14.840" end="00:52:20.610">works maybe tony's going to fix it...the time we have you will be able to see a</p>
      <p begin="00:52:20.610" end="00:52:25.430">...which is getting content life content from the internet from the source that's...has it's</p>
      <p begin="00:52:25.430" end="00:52:30.090">a powerful tool it doesn't require you to do any of the application of an need to</p>

      <p begin="00:52:37.210" end="00:52:37.940">So, we looked at</p>
      <p begin="00:52:37.940" end="00:52:42.850">...event sdk which directly interfaces...then we talked about how you can use</p>
      <p begin="00:52:42.850" end="00:52:47.140">...of health the applications to...some of the content on</p>
      <p begin="00:52:47.140" end="00:52:52.100">...mikes and then we also have this thing in the cloud recall...health service.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:52.100" end="00:52:56.730">So, a lot of people ask about what about that thing when we launched the...of</p>
      <p begin="00:52:56.730" end="00:53:02.230">...the...key partnership with some third-partyservices like run</p>

      <p begin="00:53:23.290" end="00:53:27.580">you know, people who already have existing relationship third-party services they can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:53:27.580" end="00:53:32.300">integrate all of the data and make sure that it shows up in one place...it shows up...and they wanted</p>
      <p begin="00:53:32.300" end="00:53:37.130">...so we're very excited and we're working on building microsoft...aps</p>

      <p begin="00:53:55.960" end="00:54:00.600">will allow those application services to craig the fitness of their users more comprehensive</p>

      <p begin="00:57:04.750" end="00:57:08.640">Now all right we'll take some questions.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:08.640" end="00:57:19.360">Thank you thank you please come to the microphone.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:25.910" end="00:57:27.860">Yeah, so.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:27.860" end="00:57:33.810">So, we are very aware of the fact that myself has different offerings so if you really dig in their these</p>
      <p begin="00:57:33.810" end="00:57:36.170">...different things we do have a</p>
      <p begin="00:57:36.170" end="00:57:45.460">...on converging together and coming up with something that is one holistic...</p>
      <p begin="00:57:45.460" end="00:57:50.150">...dance.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:57.480" end="00:58:02.460">So, I there is no theoretical limit I don't know-how the phone's behaves if you have</p>
      <p begin="00:58:02.460" end="00:58:07.390">multiplayer I think you would hit whatever bluetooth limits you'd run into on...that I don't think the</p>
      <p begin="00:58:07.390" end="00:58:10.130">...has any I think...itself</p>
      <p begin="00:58:10.130" end="00:58:14.760">...there might be a certain number of...that the phone can store once you</p>
      <p begin="00:58:14.760" end="00:58:24.010">...that...limit and you...be able to update any other bags.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:24.010" end="00:58:25.710">The question is what is...unicode support for the</p>
      <p begin="00:58:25.710" end="00:58:31.190">and vendors sport unicode but it doesn't support chinese japanese or</p>
      <p begin="00:58:31.190" end="00:58:37.870">the languages that's something that we are looking into the enabling.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:37.870" end="00:58:40.090">Well,...depend on the phone very does</p>
      <p begin="00:58:40.090" end="00:58:45.160">...it's a matter of localizing all of the apps and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:45.160" end="00:58:55.840">that's definitely something we are looking into this.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:55.840" end="00:59:10.510">I don't know let's I'm sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:10.510" end="00:59:15.460">You if you can run...the background...techniques and fix to make that happen</p>
      <p begin="00:59:15.460" end="00:59:19.710">you're you don't have to be in the...down in those cases so like if you're if</p>
      <p begin="00:59:19.710" end="00:59:22.700">you're music application, for example, you can run as a music backgrounds</p>
      <p begin="00:59:22.700" end="00:59:28.680">...task and that point you are actually connected all but if you're if you're not</p>
      <p begin="00:59:28.680" end="00:59:45.970">...one is very aggressive and suspending apps and...we can't do anything about that.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:45.970" end="00:59:50.860">There is no simulator right now...gotten that feedback many...people say you have like</p>
      <p begin="00:59:50.860" end="00:59:55.720">a skin temperature sense...how to aac simulate different temperatures when looking into enabling something like that</p>
      <p begin="00:59:55.720" end="01:00:06.590">and yes but right now there is...</p>
      <p begin="01:00:06.590" end="01:00:11.550">So, the question is how...the calories computed of is</p>
      <p begin="01:00:11.550" end="01:00:17.010">...a sensor is something that...so the calories are basically calculated on the from</p>
      <p begin="01:00:17.010" end="01:00:20.750">...us using your height...a gender and,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:20.750" end="01:00:25.350">also the your heart rate all throughout the day so that's something that's impropriety algorithm that we have on the from</p>
      <p begin="01:00:25.350" end="01:00:31.430">...that doesn't there's no sense and that tells us...calories.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:31.430" end="01:00:36.490">So, again, that's a program algorithm that we worked onand, it's not something there is no</p>
      <p begin="01:00:36.490" end="01:00:41.080">...that tells us if you're...asleep again it's a it's a matter how much</p>
      <p begin="01:00:41.080" end="01:00:48.400">of moving what is your if your...going all the way down...artery that telly theaterI can</p>
      <p begin="01:00:48.400" end="01:01:00.910">...information our algorithms team would love to...some that information.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:00.910" end="01:01:05.250">The ethically works across all applicant all the platforms so you</p>
      <p begin="01:01:05.250" end="01:01:09.690">see on windows yes so if you're on windows</p>
      <p begin="01:01:09.690" end="01:01:16.890">you will have to be a runtime application to be...use that.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:16.890" end="01:01:20.280">Currently the...not work on those unless you have some...of rapping</p>
      <p begin="01:01:20.280" end="01:01:27.200">...unmanaged to manage interface.</p>
