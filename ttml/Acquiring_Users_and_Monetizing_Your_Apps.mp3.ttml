      <p begin="00:00:16.409" end="00:00:20.540">So, let's get started with a quick show of hands first.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.540" end="00:00:23.780">Please raise your hand if today you have</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.780" end="00:00:28.780">an app currently published in any of apps so across platforms windows</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.780" end="00:00:33.320">ios android so pretty much almost everybody now keep your hands</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.320" end="00:00:39.500">...if you're interested in making money.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.500" end="00:00:40.580">I think even more people</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.580" end="00:00:45.260">...hands than in the first question which is good so,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.260" end="00:00:49.690">according to the latest numbers of this...in the industry.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.690" end="00:00:52.190">More than has of you.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.190" end="00:01:00.910">Are probably making less than one thousand dollars per month?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.910" end="00:01:03.530">Very interested in making more than that.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.530" end="00:01:08.480">I'm happy to say that you came to the right session.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.480" end="00:01:14.070">So, my name is envelopes and I have here with me james</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.070" end="00:01:17.690">Were both program managers in the windows...team.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.690" end="00:01:21.980">And,...super excited today to come here and talk to all of you about a number of</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.980" end="00:01:34.070">improvements that we're doing with windows...to how do you make more money with your apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.070" end="00:01:37.220">So, used to be the case not very not a</p>
      <p begin="00:01:37.220" end="00:01:41.320">very long-time ago that when you finish snap-in you publicity to the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.320" end="00:01:45.250">store you could sort of relax sit down and see</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.250" end="00:01:51.190">...results coming in maybe move on to your next project that's not the case anymore as,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.190" end="00:01:58.070">you know, when you...and...to this store this is just the beginning of a very long journey?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.070" end="00:02:02.870">...now competing with hundreds of thousands of other apps</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.870" end="00:02:10.710">that are all competing to try to get the...attention all at the same time.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:10.710" end="00:02:15.360">If you really want to be successful here you need to compete with all these developers, developers are all</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.360" end="00:02:21.830">gating very sophisticated in finding new ways to promote their apps and make money.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:21.830" end="00:02:27.200">So, if you want to make money you need to do three things very well the first</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:31.110">You need to acquire users for your app so that they have a chance to run your</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.110" end="00:02:34.810">app for the first-time second.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.810" end="00:02:38.100">You need to make sure the duos users stay engaged with</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.100" end="00:02:42.710">your app satisfied and more importantly keep coming back often to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.710" end="00:02:44.780">your app and then third</p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.780" end="00:02:49.680">unit to monetize by either selling something to those users.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:55.820">Or by selling the...inventory they generates to advertisers who are willing to pay for it.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:55.820" end="00:02:58.380">And, then throughout all this cycle.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.380" end="00:03:01.110">You need to constantly analyze.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.110" end="00:03:01.880">Fresh data.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.310" end="00:03:05.270">To improve your app.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.270" end="00:03:08.900">And, to optimize your marketing strategy.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:08.900" end="00:03:09.600">So, today</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.600" end="00:03:14.590">we want-to talk to-you about a number of tools and services that were introducing with windows</p>
      <p begin="00:03:14.590" end="00:03:21.850">ten to help you acquire engage and monetize users.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:21.850" end="00:03:25.540">So, let's talk about user acquisition first.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:25.540" end="00:03:28.270">There's many ways many different strategies that</p>
      <p begin="00:03:28.270" end="00:03:32.550">you can use for user acquisition so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:32.550" end="00:03:37.010">here james and I recently finished developing...latest game.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:37.010" end="00:03:41.120">Controls all I know great name.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:46.500">And, we're just thinking about our user acquisition strategy however going to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.500" end="00:03:51.550">bring new users to the game so we thought about a number of things we thought about leveraging social media</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.550" end="00:03:56.760">within posts or new gaming twitter and facebook we're going to write a</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.760" end="00:03:58.430">...send an e-mail to our customer</p>
      <p begin="00:03:58.430" end="00:04:03.080">...and get this thing promoted we also thought about reaching out to app reviews</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.080" end="00:04:03.580">sites.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.640" end="00:04:09.210">...select number of game review sites on the web that we know are very of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.210" end="00:04:14.020">high-quality and we saw we get...to review our game and publishing</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14.020" end="00:04:19.300">...review these will drive a bunch of high-quality users are game we also thought</p>
      <p begin="00:04:19.300" end="00:04:23.620">about running a pay that...slapped campaign to bring in more users.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.620" end="00:04:28.270">And, we also had about a user referral model where we</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.270" end="00:04:34.420">could leverage our own users of the game to bringing even more users.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:34.420" end="00:04:36.920">Now with all these different user acquisitions strategies.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:39.320">Is very important?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:40.470" end="00:04:43.370">To make sure that you're able to measure</p>
      <p begin="00:04:43.370" end="00:04:48.110">and track the effectiveness of each one of these different campaigns so.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:48.110" end="00:04:51.780">That you can then optimize and focus on those campaigns those</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.780" end="00:04:56.960">...strategies that are bringing in the highest quality users.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:05:01.780">So, in order to measure the effectiveness of these campaigns.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:01.780" end="00:05:08.080">With windows stan I'm very happy to announce that were introducing campaign attribution.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.080" end="00:05:14.290">campaign attribution you can define a unique campaign identifier.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:14.290" end="00:05:19.340">For each of your user acquisition campaigns it's very easy to use</p>
      <p begin="00:05:19.340" end="00:05:23.770">campaign attribution you just create a deep link to your app in</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23.770" end="00:05:24.980">this store.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:24.980" end="00:05:28.400">...in the format that were shown in this live.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:28.400" end="00:05:29.350">And, then you append.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:32.020">...end of it</p>
      <p begin="00:05:32.020" end="00:05:38.240">ac id parameter with the name of the campaign that you choose.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:42.200">Now you have a number of depleting so you can use this freely wherever you want</p>
      <p begin="00:05:42.200" end="00:05:42.990">your different.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:44.120" end="00:05:48.900">Marketing vehicles as users click...this links and come to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.900" end="00:05:52.640">the store and ultimately install your app.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52.640" end="00:05:54.450">The windows is store.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:54.450" end="00:05:58.410">Will keep track of all of this?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58.410" end="00:06:01.100">By come into the new...sinner.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:01.100" end="00:06:05.330">You'll then be able to get a detailed attribution report that you can</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.330" end="00:06:10.550">field thereby camping so that then you can...for each one of these.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:10.550" end="00:06:17.690">What was a number of clicks and ultimately the number of installs...got?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:17.690" end="00:06:20.710">But, even better your app.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:20.710" end="00:06:25.510">Will be able to query this campaign identifier at runtime?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:25.510" end="00:06:26.770">So, that it knows.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:27.860" end="00:06:32.010">Which campaign led to its own install?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:32.010" end="00:06:36.570">And, this is very interesting for different scenarios the first way in which</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.570" end="00:06:41.040">we're going to use these for our user referral scenario.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.040" end="00:06:43.970">With can't also?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:43.970" end="00:06:47.030">For any user who brings seeing.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:47.030" end="00:06:50.950">Ten or more of their frames also join the game.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.950" end="00:06:53.540">We're going to give them a reward.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:53.540" end="00:06:57.590">Of one hundred gold coins of in game currency.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57.590" end="00:07:01.320">And, we can do that with campaign attribution with compare</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.320" end="00:07:06.070">attribution our game can generate on-the-fly campaign id.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:06.070" end="00:07:10.840">And, give a...into the user then can be shared across their networks of</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.840" end="00:07:11.340">friends?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:12.360" end="00:07:17.180">And, then add runtime we can checking the app and verify and track.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:17.180" end="00:07:24.570">How many users each one of these users brought and then give them the appropriate...</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.570" end="00:07:27.050">The other use for these is analytics.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:28.440" end="00:07:31.950">Your app can at runtime get the campaign identifier</p>
      <p begin="00:07:31.950" end="00:07:36.820">...app to your analytic solution...allows you to do things they create user</p>
      <p begin="00:07:36.820" end="00:07:40.820">...based on where the users who are required from.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:40.820" end="00:07:45.280">And, then you can analyze user cohorts and understand how the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:45.280" end="00:07:50.810">users that you acquired from facebook behave differently from the users</p>
      <p begin="00:07:50.810" end="00:07:54.270">...you acquired in some other place.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.270" end="00:07:58.600">And, more importantly what-you want-to do is calculate the amount of</p>
      <p begin="00:07:58.600" end="00:08:01.500">money and revenue your making for each of these</p>
      <p begin="00:08:01.500" end="00:08:06.170">different user groups and then focus on those campaigns.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.170" end="00:08:09.350">That are giving you the highest lifetime value of</p>
      <p begin="00:08:09.350" end="00:08:15.110">users at the lowest.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:15.110" end="00:08:18.050">So,...why don't you show us how to use these...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:18.050" end="00:08:19.790">Thanks...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:19.790" end="00:08:24.370">...recovered earlier we have a...demo application publish the store.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:24.370" end="00:08:28.460">And, now that it's out there we switched our focus to the acquisition of new users to</p>
      <p begin="00:08:28.460" end="00:08:31.810">our application and one of the first strategies we chose</p>
      <p begin="00:08:31.810" end="00:08:37.950">...leverage was social media so let me switch over here right great and,</p>

      <p begin="00:21:56.830" end="00:22:01.700">user sessions for application overtime this is the number of times that...users actually started</p>
      <p begin="00:22:01.700" end="00:22:06.370">...application maybe we'll see how that's trending over time.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:06.370" end="00:22:09.600">I'm able to see how those are started across all</p>

      <p begin="00:48:05.540" end="00:48:08.990">It's just going to be able to work with older reviews say</p>
      <p begin="00:48:08.990" end="00:48:13.350">...updating my app throughout for a couple of years now and some of the old reviews</p>
      <p begin="00:48:13.350" end="00:48:18.230">were very popular requesting features I've implemented now and they're still very high up because they</p>

      <p begin="00:49:34.540" end="00:49:39.520">To understand where the downloads came from for campaigns you created</p>
      <p begin="00:49:39.520" end="00:49:44.990">or...sources such as promotions within the store</p>

      <p begin="00:50:30.840" end="00:50:36.090">to make sure I understood I think you want to know if you can respond</p>
      <p begin="00:50:36.090" end="00:50:40.510">to a user at the same time use that as a vehicle to promote some of your other apps</p>
      <p begin="00:50:40.510" end="00:50:45.460">exist we have a specific guidance on how you can use the respond to review feature</p>
      <p begin="00:50:45.460" end="00:50:51.760">and this is something that were not letting you do at this point you can always promote</p>
      <p begin="00:50:51.760" end="00:50:56.660">a new ad the to the app that fixes and existing issue and</p>
      <p begin="00:50:56.660" end="00:51:01.390">it's about providing meaningful information to the user at that point this is not</p>
      <p begin="00:51:01.390" end="00:51:07.240">a it would be great but it's not a marketing vehicle for your other apps?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:07.240" end="00:51:10.100">There's other ways which we've shown you that you can use for</p>
      <p begin="00:51:10.100" end="00:51:17.440">that and now your second question well,...</p>
      <p begin="00:51:17.440" end="00:51:20.160">...correct the second question is about</p>
      <p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:24.120">which formatdoes a user get to a your response</p>
      <p begin="00:51:24.120" end="00:51:27.800">...so you can either respond privately or publicly</p>
      <p begin="00:51:27.800" end="00:51:32.290">you respond privately it's an email that goes to the to the user?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:32.290" end="00:51:34.860">The email that the user gets will also have a</p>
      <p begin="00:51:34.860" end="00:51:40.520">link where they can cleats where they can click land in the review that they</p>
      <p begin="00:51:40.520" end="00:51:45.020">wrote and modify it if they want okay so it's an e-mail if</p>
      <p begin="00:51:45.020" end="00:51:48.220">...publicly it's obviously just a public</p>
      <p begin="00:51:48.220" end="00:51:52.980">response that will show up both...the website for this store as well as historic client</p>

      <p begin="00:52:05.700" end="00:52:10.310">there a way to track those users if they've downloaded afterwards for</p>

      <p begin="00:52:17.300" end="00:52:22.080">talked about where your app can query the see id at runtime.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:22.080" end="00:52:24.430">Save you do that and your</p>

      <p begin="00:52:42.430" end="00:52:47.430">I went kind of quick over that but just...dive in one level deeper.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:47.430" end="00:52:52.440">When the way we actually track conversion basically...attributed purchase other nap purchaser that</p>
