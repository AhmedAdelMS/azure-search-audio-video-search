      <p begin="00:00:08.540" end="00:00:14.730">good hello welcome everybody pretty exciting keno this morning.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.730" end="00:00:19.470">So, if you don't realize...you stumbled into the native ui framework talk so happy</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.470" end="00:00:24.810">to see here my name is joe segment I'll be...session guide if you will for the next hour</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.810" end="00:00:30.890">and I'm talking about new features in the ui platform for a building I think we're</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.890" end="00:00:33.700">calling them now universal windows apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.700" end="00:00:39.940">So, with that let me go ahead and get my clicker hearing...organized.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.940" end="00:00:41.950">So, please submit evaluations</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.950" end="00:00:46.950">their super important overall for the conference as well as for me and for this talk.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.950" end="00:00:51.390">And, plus you get a free prize I...there's a drawing for free prize which maybe know what it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.390" end="00:00:55.760">is I don't so starting write-off I really can't see the audience from</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.760" end="00:00:57.790">...try anyway does...not know what</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.790" end="00:01:02.810">...me I see somebody's hand kinda go up</p>
      <p begin="00:01:02.810" end="00:01:07.650">...this slide for use don't feel bad side is just free now maybe they were just waving</p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.650" end="00:01:12.670">...each other okay anyway it is the if no,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.670" end="00:01:16.970">one really is new to it then I won't spend time on it is basically the native</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.970" end="00:01:19.460">...I platform for the system and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.460" end="00:01:24.110">...what we use for building by native I mean it chips with the platform</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.110" end="00:01:27.540">...what the first part experiences in the shells used to</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.540" end="00:01:29.240">...their experiences and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.240" end="00:01:33.900">...what anybody building and native app typically uses to build-out there user interface and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.900" end="00:01:38.080">by user interface I mean buttons sliders list those sorts of things tad</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.080" end="00:01:44.160">internet activity to the app experience example is all about that so, you saw</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.160" end="00:01:49.230">on windows...a lot of things this morning...keynote just a ton of things but, one of</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.230" end="00:01:56.030">the main things about hitting at whatever three billion number and some huge number in the next couple</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.030" end="00:02:00.700">years a devices...and that super important for windows but what we're trying to do across the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.700" end="00:02:05.130">depth plat and including across...framework is want to make it easier</p>
      <p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:08.220">for you to take your experiences and delivered those across</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.220" end="00:02:13.060">all those endpoints so, there's some things we can do related to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.060" end="00:02:17.900">just a unify platform but they're actually other things we can do to make it easier for you to be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:17.900" end="00:02:22.640">adaptor experience based on the device or some other characteristic so I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:27.750">going to talk about both those later on in this in this talk part of also, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.750" end="00:02:32.020">having this broader if you will set of devices that even if you're</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.020" end="00:02:37.260">somebody who's only targeting let's say mobile we've increased on our side of increase the ecosystem</p>
      <p begin="00:02:37.260" end="00:02:41.890">so if you're only targeting mobile that means there's more code samples out there there's more people actually banging on</p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.890" end="00:02:46.750">the platform make it faster making it better so even targeting just one device</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.750" end="00:02:52.580">this broader ecosystem is really goodness for everybody so we did a bunch of stuff around</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.580" end="00:02:58.480">universal windows apps but also we did other stuff around</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.480" end="00:03:02.950">...just basic talking to customers and they said hey I want this or I want that and,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:02.950" end="00:03:08.020">if you wondering the second...is not a carries christmas card to me is</p>
      <p begin="00:03:08.020" end="00:03:15.340">...than that sarah and actually I'm just joking was the birthday...was...but,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.340" end="00:03:17.540">that's actually showing inc off in that one</p>
      <p begin="00:03:17.540" end="00:03:22.530">I'll give you a quick demo that later on the talk but we did we try to talk to customers events</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.530" end="00:03:27.270">like this we go me customers we look at forms we know there's a lot we can do with the native</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.270" end="00:03:33.120">...I platform so we try to incorporate some of that feedback as well into this release.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:36.750">So, that is a dev conference so</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.750" end="00:03:40.630">how about a starting off with a dev.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:40.630" end="00:03:44.150">Demo I've got like...little options to pick up here and I think I got</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.150" end="00:03:46.220">the right one visual studio.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:52.150">...to do...project I'll do this once today</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52.150" end="00:03:56.990">...project and guess what you see I've selected in this case csharp.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.990" end="00:04:01.710">Windows, windows universal there's not a phone project there's not, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:01.710" end="00:04:05.390">some sort of multi headed project...xbox project, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:05.390" end="00:04:10.150">there's not io t project there's one universal project</p>
      <p begin="00:04:10.150" end="00:04:15.230">now you may choose to only deploy it...when you go to the store...side or you may choose</p>
      <p begin="00:04:15.230" end="00:04:19.800">the only ship it to one set of devices but the platform really is the same</p>
      <p begin="00:04:19.800" end="00:04:25.240">...the same across everything so finally project is just it's a file new universal</p>
      <p begin="00:04:25.240" end="00:04:30.600">...all over endpoints so let's do how about</p>
      <p begin="00:04:30.600" end="00:04:35.340">a hello world project because those are always fun now this</p>
      <p begin="00:04:35.340" end="00:04:39.630">is a...once because...takes a little bit of time so why setting up</p>
      <p begin="00:04:39.630" end="00:04:42.970">...things I want to show you as I clicked in a far-right corner and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:42.970" end="00:04:46.620">bring up the new if you will see a countering experience that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:47.630" end="00:04:51.670">...more touch friendly than what you might have on your...one systems...previous systems</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.670" end="00:04:56.440">...some of you may know who are familiar example that currently today we don't actually have a calendar control</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.440" end="00:05:00.670">in the platform so I thought would be fun for the hello world experience</p>
      <p begin="00:05:00.670" end="00:05:04.760">would be to actually try to build-out this kind of experience ec</p>
      <p begin="00:05:04.760" end="00:05:11.250">it's very touch friendly it's really nicezoom in zoom out so it</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.250" end="00:05:15.460">will be a bit of a challenge but, let's go ahead and give it a shot.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.520" end="00:05:20.600">So, I'm going to come back to the designed...minute so...universal</p>
      <p begin="00:05:20.600" end="00:05:25.360">project should run ideally should run everywhere so let me start</p>
      <p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:33.130">take a look at this thing again...what I'm doing here the...calendar view.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:33.130" end="00:05:35.540">Margin equals twenty.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.540" end="00:05:38.840">Vertical lambda equals tub.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.840" end="00:05:43.900">...see that's go looking design you now.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:43.900" end="00:05:51.940">It looks pretty good.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:51.940" end="00:05:57.630">And, that's how easy it is so.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:57.630" end="00:06:00.790">Go ahead and run it to show you this is...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.790" end="00:06:04.190">...counter control I just...in a feature there</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.190" end="00:06:09.350">...few people requested it was like number two hundred-something on some things somewhere</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.350" end="00:06:10.250">let's see control.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.510" end="00:06:13.490">Seriously.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.490" end="00:06:15.560">Goes higher up and others.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.560" end="00:06:18.600">But, I did look it up so,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.600" end="00:06:22.830">I'm having a five I'm going to run this locally even though just you saw</p>
      <p begin="00:06:22.830" end="00:06:24.670">it the exact same.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24.670" end="00:06:27.820">Exact same control down here we didn't make it and what we did</p>
      <p begin="00:06:27.820" end="00:06:31.830">a windows ten is that basically all the inbox experiences are using example</p>
      <p begin="00:06:31.830" end="00:06:35.890">develop their experiences so no more going how do they do that it</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.890" end="00:06:40.570">actually did it using the same platform that you're using so here you see super simple</p>
      <p begin="00:06:40.570" end="00:06:44.730">calendar control I won't...through the counter experience but want to show you is to universe</p>
      <p begin="00:06:44.730" end="00:06:47.640">...so let's go ahead and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:47.640" end="00:06:51.090">show some universal action here I'm going to pick arm and I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:06:51.090" end="00:06:55.530">keeping it reels here if you will I may regret this but</p>
      <p begin="00:06:55.530" end="00:06:59.550">I'm going-to go ahead and run this now on my</p>
      <p begin="00:06:59.550" end="00:07:04.260">real device and I'm going to project my screen so I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:07:04.260" end="00:07:05.880">...crazier?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.880" end="00:07:10.320">So, this is my it's my engineering phone half...as my</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.320" end="00:07:14.940">...phone and again I'll do this whole deployment first-time once</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.940" end="00:07:19.780">like right now I have to just kinda...I know it's I know it's doing the right thing but I'm so in-patient I just</p>
      <p begin="00:07:19.780" end="00:07:21.300">got a look.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:21.300" end="00:07:22.580">So, yes, it is deploying</p>
      <p begin="00:07:22.580" end="00:07:29.950">again I'll do this sort of fold cycle just to kinda show you that it's real just a couple times...ago.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:29.950" end="00:07:34.070">Here's the experience exact same experience not a separate head exact same example file</p>
      <p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:40.250">now but we'll be running on my phone and you see it's all nice and touch friendly and I can do all the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:40.250" end="00:07:44.660">exact same stuff and I can swipe but exact same experience here</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44.660" end="00:07:49.580">...phone and across my desktop experience so,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.580" end="00:07:56.650">you know, that's pretty cool it's one control so now I'm going to do my julia child and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:56.650" end="00:08:01.320">I'm going to open up an existing app I have this really is more universal</p>
      <p begin="00:08:01.320" end="00:08:06.230">controls what I've done here is really is almost zero code</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.230" end="00:08:08.740">an art the only code in this experience and run</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08.740" end="00:08:15.160">...real quick the only code in this experience is that I wired up.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:15.160" end="00:08:19.370">Something to basically open close the left pain.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:19.370" end="00:08:22.490">And, I made it so that when I click on the when he's left</p>
      <p begin="00:08:22.490" end="00:08:26.420">...things I reload different page here but that's really all I've done in</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.420" end="00:08:30.950">this app experience and I don't know why it's taken a minute here to build.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30.950" end="00:08:34.120">This is basically all taken pretty much a whole set of common</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.120" end="00:08:39.380">controls and just put them into and untouched the all the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:39.380" end="00:08:43.640">...controls into this one app and we'll show you the experience running on a couple</p>
      <p begin="00:08:43.640" end="00:08:48.050">different form factors that but again there's no platform optimizations here</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:53.120">this...thing pops up...showing you is</p>
      <p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:57.870">well first of all you can see there's a slightly updated branding and part of that was because now that would bring it</p>
      <p begin="00:08:57.870" end="00:09:02.630">to hollow...phone and a few other devices we needed</p>
      <p begin="00:09:02.630" end="00:09:06.820">make sure had something that was consistent across all those so we had to do some updates</p>
      <p begin="00:09:06.820" end="00:09:09.860">...worth comptroller et cetera et cetera but here you see,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.860" end="00:09:14.500">you know, not just all the controls working as you'd expect with a slightly updated branding</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.660" end="00:09:21.550">...suggest box working some slightly updated day-time pickers.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.550" end="00:09:25.110">some other controls now what I want to show you here...desktop.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:26.990" end="00:09:31.720">Have a command bar with overflows we've made people familiar command...see that's we made</p>
      <p begin="00:09:31.720" end="00:09:36.950">some updates to the command bar too many updates me to go through all of them but one thing I want to show</p>
      <p begin="00:09:36.950" end="00:09:42.140">here is going to click here and I added a we at</p>
      <p begin="00:09:42.140" end="00:09:46.930">...menu and you see a couple things people familiar the platform one we added cascading which is nice</p>
      <p begin="00:09:46.930" end="00:09:51.890">...it actually on desktop and other windows apps it goes outside the window which is which</p>
      <p begin="00:09:51.890" end="00:09:56.770">is nice but we've done otherwise snipes little things we could do on which is I just it with my finger and now</p>
      <p begin="00:09:56.770" end="00:10:01.630">you see we actually increase the spacing on that context menu</p>
      <p begin="00:10:01.630" end="00:10:06.680">when I actually hit with my finger so where possible we've actually tried to put things in the platform that</p>
      <p begin="00:10:06.680" end="00:10:11.660">kind of do the right thing where it's likely not going to impact the developer so let's say we made all controls</p>
      <p begin="00:10:11.660" end="00:10:16.520">bigger on phone...smaller on desktop you're going to have to think about layout now so we</p>
      <p begin="00:10:16.520" end="00:10:21.060">try to make a good-size that works well everywhere and cases where we could do this we</p>
      <p begin="00:10:21.060" end="00:10:25.450">kind of light up the right behavior where you don't have to think about it or it won't get any way we did that</p>
      <p begin="00:10:25.450" end="00:10:31.160">as well so let's go ahead and take this one step further and do the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:31.160" end="00:10:35.590">...deployment here and I'll show you at running on</p>
      <p begin="00:10:35.590" end="00:10:40.300">my phone and you see the same experience so won't take a lot of time here?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:40.300" end="00:10:42.410">Project my phone...</p>
      <p begin="00:10:42.410" end="00:10:47.360">Now one thing right away you go hey that's kind of a crappy experience and,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:50.450">that has nothing to do with hamburger is that I really had to</p>
      <p begin="00:10:50.450" end="00:10:54.470">give you default experience here this is one of things I'll talk about later...my talk which is</p>
      <p begin="00:10:54.470" end="00:10:59.000">...sometimes even though I'm going to show you all the controls it's in a</p>
      <p begin="00:10:59.000" end="00:11:02.220">...grid which is why it's a single...here if I actually do it</p>
      <p begin="00:11:02.220" end="00:11:06.730">landscaping case you think I've got a different view here doing any magic exact same desktop</p>
      <p begin="00:11:06.730" end="00:11:11.320">view but the how I interact with it going through the menu here is less</p>
      <p begin="00:11:11.320" end="00:11:16.300">than ideal and I'll talk about how you can fix that later on the talk bc all the controls work</p>
      <p begin="00:11:16.300" end="00:11:21.490">the same way but when you to other controls now hit the fly out you see</p>
      <p begin="00:11:21.490" end="00:11:26.560">has the wide spacing like it should and...app are command bar you see</p>
      <p begin="00:11:26.560" end="00:11:31.410">...actual edge to edge because we can do that it's slightly better on mobile and use a deb don't have to think</p>
      <p begin="00:11:31.410" end="00:11:36.090">about it so nice experience with all the controls everywhere but you sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:11:36.090" end="00:11:40.710">our promise here was not just about these two devices but a</p>
      <p begin="00:11:40.710" end="00:11:45.480">couple devices so what I'm going to do here is anybody who came</p>
      <p begin="00:11:45.480" end="00:11:47.480">...a little earlier I'm not sure anybody did come</p>
      <p begin="00:11:47.480" end="00:11:52.530">...early...sorry the reason this is blurry is not because of anything to</p>
      <p begin="00:11:52.530" end="00:11:57.260">do the system it's because I'm go on my xbox one here html I out to</p>
      <p begin="00:11:57.260" end="00:12:01.890">va to this little box and as a result of all that it's got less than optimal</p>
      <p begin="00:12:01.890" end="00:12:06.860">experience this is the same map and literally I just deployed it...right before I came in here</p>
      <p begin="00:12:06.860" end="00:12:13.130">just to make sure we didn't have any issues exactly map experience working with controller?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:13.130" end="00:12:18.390">And, one thing we're still fixing is focus on...super importance...light up focus</p>
      <p begin="00:12:18.390" end="00:12:22.590">...right now on agile planning on having a...toggle agile planning but you can see</p>
      <p begin="00:12:22.590" end="00:12:26.730">...to check box all the controls just work the way you expected</p>
      <p begin="00:12:26.730" end="00:12:29.370">...are simple controls but I can come into the of</p>
      <p begin="00:12:29.370" end="00:12:32.750">...just box hit a and I can go down</p>
      <p begin="00:12:32.750" end="00:12:37.040">get this the sip and I can do exactly like what my desktop experience</p>
      <p begin="00:12:37.040" end="00:12:42.930">it be to get out of there I'm going back to choose...here on there</p>
      <p begin="00:12:42.930" end="00:12:47.950">we go she say this never crashes or other and uci going</p>
      <p begin="00:12:47.950" end="00:12:51.600">...common box and interact by default I did nothing to light of this</p>
      <p begin="00:12:51.600" end="00:12:55.880">experience it just works that doesn't mean you don't need to tailor you might not want to tailor</p>
      <p begin="00:12:55.880" end="00:13:00.030">...that exact same experience works on xbox.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:01.080" end="00:13:06.520">there's the app running there but I've deployed it to one other device so,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:06.520" end="00:13:10.140">let's try this one and see if that's correct.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:10.140" end="00:13:15.140">Again, exact same exact same app now it's running on this raspberry</p>
      <p begin="00:13:15.140" end="00:13:20.750">...to my exact same app.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:20.750" end="00:13:23.820">I may want to tailor just to show you is the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:23.820" end="00:13:28.210">exact same experience working on this device done nothing just deployed</p>
      <p begin="00:13:28.210" end="00:13:32.080">in everything works exactly the same I don't have a keyboard hooked up to</p>
      <p begin="00:13:32.080" end="00:13:36.370">a but if I did I be able to show you more interactivity in this but that's really what we've done here is</p>
      <p begin="00:13:36.370" end="00:13:40.440">really taken this common platform no...and...</p>
      <p begin="00:13:40.440" end="00:13:43.280">big dot net no you gotta do a tricky different version</p>
      <p begin="00:13:43.280" end="00:13:47.770">is the same thing run across all these different endpoints and we've really tried to make the controls</p>
      <p begin="00:13:47.770" end="00:13:51.960">were great across all those different endpoints tailoring those different story and that's what</p>
      <p begin="00:13:51.960" end="00:13:57.400">...spend a lot of the rest of my talk I'm talking about the tailoring...to this so.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:57.400" end="00:13:58.920">With that.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:58.920" end="00:14:03.860">I'll get back to the dec so one thing I do want to mention is that, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:03.860" end="00:14:07.160">people how many people built-in aone app say when universe</p>
      <p begin="00:14:07.160" end="00:14:11.940">...some folks so as part of that you probably used to this experience where</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.940" end="00:14:16.870">you create multiple heads one for phone and one for desktop which don't have to do now</p>
      <p begin="00:14:16.870" end="00:14:20.320">...part of that is that sometimes the controls they were there is similar</p>
      <p begin="00:14:20.320" end="00:14:25.480">but slightly different so we had a take all those rough edges and kind of sand them off but that means</p>
      <p begin="00:14:25.480" end="00:14:31.130">some times we had cases like password box where the default experience</p>
      <p begin="00:14:31.130" end="00:14:36.270">for was just different crossed windows desktop and windows phone</p>
      <p begin="00:14:36.270" end="00:14:41.600">didn't have it on desktop and...on xbox...have to worry about it where cases like this</p>
      <p begin="00:14:41.600" end="00:14:46.580">...had to pick a...and do something about it so what we did I guess I can use</p>
      <p begin="00:14:46.580" end="00:14:51.480">the clicker here is that just to let-you know that in those cases we picked the default behavior</p>
      <p begin="00:14:51.480" end="00:14:54.860">and the way we pick the default behavior is we basically took a bunch</p>
      <p begin="00:14:54.860" end="00:14:59.860">of data that we got from people using the experience we put in the cloud we did</p>
      <p begin="00:14:59.860" end="00:15:04.820">a bunch analytics on it we had our data scientist poke and prod on it and it's this out this is what you should</p>
      <p begin="00:15:04.820" end="00:15:09.070">do this I think that's what we did I just picked behavior but I'm not</p>
      <p begin="00:15:09.070" end="00:15:13.090">...the first one and, we anyway...result is we had to</p>
      <p begin="00:15:13.090" end="00:15:17.600">pick a behavior and then the end result is that sometimes you're stuck in which we</p>
      <p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:21.570">...the all phone behavior and some people may love that...the old windows behavior</p>
      <p begin="00:15:21.570" end="00:15:26.360">they may love that so how do we deal with that so on those cases we end up having the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:26.360" end="00:15:28.130">at another property that says hey which</p>
      <p begin="00:15:28.130" end="00:15:32.860">behavior do you want and if you're going to build a windows ten head on top of your</p>
      <p begin="00:15:32.860" end="00:15:37.200">if you want to build a windows ten head-on top your existing eight one app and you start with...assets</p>
      <p begin="00:15:37.200" end="00:15:42.720">than...are things like this that you're going to have to know about and there's a talk on friday by sam</p>
      <p begin="00:15:42.720" end="00:15:47.140">darwin who's actually go into this in detail but I'm not but on</p>
      <p begin="00:15:47.140" end="00:15:51.890">the way to getting to universal apps we had some?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:51.890" end="00:15:53.240">Pleasant.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:53.240" end="00:15:55.470">Pleasant trees fall out of that and that we had controls</p>
      <p begin="00:15:55.470" end="00:15:59.890">that only lived on one or the other so for those things.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:59.890" end="00:16:03.810">We...either do nothing or we could say hey let's just</p>
      <p begin="00:16:03.810" end="00:16:06.330">make and universal and pivot is a signature control,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:06.330" end="00:16:11.740">control on phone and we looked at that...I said it feels like a really touch centric</p>
      <p begin="00:16:11.740" end="00:16:16.340">...no this thing can were great with mouse and keyboard all we need to do is we</p>
      <p begin="00:16:16.340" end="00:16:19.160">add some flippers to make it work with mouse and keyboard and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:19.160" end="00:16:23.950">actually works like a tab like experience and we took a step further we made it so it could actually more</p>
      <p begin="00:16:23.950" end="00:16:27.910">easily be branded to do a tab like experience whether you want to do that on phone or</p>
      <p begin="00:16:27.910" end="00:16:32.120">desktop so we took this control we made it work well on desktop and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:32.120" end="00:16:36.850">then we added some features to it and you see that's a common theme for next few</p>
      <p begin="00:16:36.850" end="00:16:42.880">slides here content dialogue was another control that is was previously only on</p>
      <p begin="00:16:42.880" end="00:16:47.690">phony one on windows there was something called</p>
      <p begin="00:16:47.690" end="00:16:51.890">message dialogue or something like that but it didn't support example child content for people</p>
      <p begin="00:16:51.890" end="00:16:56.880">or example people this does so this now you can use if you need to do a app</p>
      <p begin="00:16:56.880" end="00:17:00.200">...stuff and it's again more powerful than what you might have been used to before</p>
      <p begin="00:17:00.200" end="00:17:05.690">...what...suggest box was the way you do...complete if you will</p>
      <p begin="00:17:05.690" end="00:17:11.240">...phone and unfortunate windows we had a different solution</p>
      <p begin="00:17:11.240" end="00:17:15.420">called search box so that would created a tough one because we didn't want to convergent have</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.420" end="00:17:20.410">to things so,...pick which everyone you want so what we did is it</p>
      <p begin="00:17:20.410" end="00:17:25.120">and they were both had slightly different behaviors so what we did is we took the good stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:29.470">in search box which was it had some good aimee support search cliff we added those</p>
      <p begin="00:17:29.470" end="00:17:33.940">...suggest box we still have search box but likely in the future we're going to deprecated and put</p>
      <p begin="00:17:33.940" end="00:17:35.200">our investments into</p>
      <p begin="00:17:35.200" end="00:17:41.380">a of suggest box and then maps there were like a nokia maps and</p>
      <p begin="00:17:41.380" end="00:17:46.310">...a...maps and now they're just one maps with even more features and I believe there's a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:46.310" end="00:17:50.630">talk that goes into detail on this either later today or next week so now also you got a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:50.630" end="00:17:57.210">universal maps api which is kind of nice and with that that's kind of the I'll get on to</p>
      <p begin="00:17:57.210" end="00:18:01.910">mostly net new stuff now but that's kind of the things that just fell out of us kind of getting to</p>
      <p begin="00:18:01.910" end="00:18:05.400">one common core platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:05.400" end="00:18:09.950">So, I mentioned before that we've really tried really hard to make it so that are controls actually really</p>
      <p begin="00:18:09.950" end="00:18:14.010">were great everywhere and that means they work with...work on</p>
      <p begin="00:18:14.010" end="00:18:19.340">you take app and runner as a holographic experience and it works iswhat</p>
      <p begin="00:18:19.340" end="00:18:23.860">we call flat-out xbox controller we've tried to make it so use a developer don't have to</p>
      <p begin="00:18:23.860" end="00:18:28.370">do anything there it doesn't mean if you're writing custom controls you won't have to do something but in general</p>
      <p begin="00:18:28.370" end="00:18:31.270">we've really try to make it such that we don't think controls will</p>
      <p begin="00:18:31.270" end="00:18:35.840">be you're dealing with controls across different devices if you will be a big issue for</p>
      <p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:40.720">developers what is going to probably be more of a big issue is that when you start thinking about</p>
      <p begin="00:18:40.720" end="00:18:45.460">building those to using those controls to build-up more complex views and attached on this and the keynote</p>
      <p begin="00:18:45.460" end="00:18:50.850">in my talk before this but you rarely maybe you come across...experience</p>
      <p begin="00:18:50.850" end="00:18:55.180">like calculator where guess what one view works everywhere it's perfect</p>
      <p begin="00:18:55.180" end="00:18:59.950">...five only one design but that's probably not the most</p>
      <p begin="00:18:59.950" end="00:19:04.780">common thing so anybody who's used even...thirty-two programming</p>
      <p begin="00:19:04.780" end="00:19:09.780">or used doing web programming knows that windows can be resize</p>
      <p begin="00:19:09.780" end="00:19:14.260">...and this is an extension to that not only can windows be resize but now you</p>
      <p begin="00:19:14.260" end="00:19:18.780">can run your window if you will exact same window on multiple devices with different</p>
      <p begin="00:19:18.780" end="00:19:21.870">characteristics screen size being one of them so</p>
      <p begin="00:19:21.870" end="00:19:25.830">use a developer you're going to probably want to do something to optimize are</p>
      <p begin="00:19:25.830" end="00:19:30.050">tailor for that so we've tried inject some things into the platform to make that easier which is what</p>
      <p begin="00:19:30.050" end="00:19:36.610">to talk about next and all this is a showing here which I think I'm going to do a demo of is that,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:36.610" end="00:19:40.530">you know, things like secondary navigation actually let me just jump into the demos</p>
      <p begin="00:19:41.540" end="00:19:46.700">...the picture read frame around me and a girl I photographed in</p>
      <p begin="00:19:46.700" end="00:19:50.550">...shopped in there that is just showing that the screenshot</p>
      <p begin="00:19:50.550" end="00:19:54.380">...the screens are the photo sizes actually smaller on...</p>
      <p begin="00:19:54.380" end="00:19:59.280">it's actually literally it's actually smaller...photos experience here because they don't want to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:59.280" end="00:20:03.520">...use much memory on that device so there's one about the navigation which is one of the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:07.750">red boxes but that's what it was trying to show there but forget analysis jump</p>
      <p begin="00:20:07.750" end="00:20:12.450">to just kinda show you what I really want to show you here?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:12.450" end="00:20:15.380">Pick the right one.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:15.380" end="00:20:19.000">Back here yes okay in my app</p>
      <p begin="00:20:19.000" end="00:20:24.700">...a pop-up photos just real quick because you've and,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:24.700" end="00:20:29.320">carrie and test on this a little bit but the main thing I want to show here is that this is an experience</p>
      <p begin="00:20:29.320" end="00:20:31.340">...going to see a lot which is, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:31.340" end="00:20:36.280">as you resize the app adapts and in here...fire I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:20:36.280" end="00:20:40.600">...up my phone which I'll show you in a minute but it's...get fired up so you have to wait for it to fire</p>
      <p begin="00:20:40.600" end="00:20:45.950">up on phone but as a developer these are the kind of things that you</p>
      <p begin="00:20:45.950" end="00:20:49.120">even on desktop...a desktop I have to worry about resize</p>
      <p begin="00:20:49.120" end="00:20:53.860">ing so there are certain things that you're likely going to want to be able to do to your app and one of the things in the first thing</p>
      <p begin="00:20:53.860" end="00:20:57.640">...all talk about is you are seeing and I'm not going to</p>
      <p begin="00:20:57.640" end="00:21:01.780">...for the hamburger pattern because we don't bake in if you will the hamburger pattern</p>
      <p begin="00:21:01.780" end="00:21:06.420">per say into...control what I do want to say is there are times where</p>
      <p begin="00:21:06.420" end="00:21:10.980">you have secondary commands like navigation commands here and</p>
      <p begin="00:21:10.980" end="00:21:14.710">...important in a great to see when you have enough space but when you don't have</p>
      <p begin="00:21:14.710" end="00:21:19.050">enough space those are the kind of things especially in photos where you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:21:19.050" end="00:21:23.970">...pictures of something like my beautiful wife here that you want to hide those</p>
      <p begin="00:21:23.970" end="00:21:28.560">instill making available through a secondary ux affords in the case here.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:28.560" end="00:21:30.150">You can see the affords is now</p>
      <p begin="00:21:30.150" end="00:21:34.460">...popped out I've got a pop out and...the main features one of</p>
      <p begin="00:21:34.460" end="00:21:39.560">features that we added in windows ten that I'll show is a feature called split view</p>
      <p begin="00:21:39.560" end="00:21:44.410">it basically enables this experience in fact that's what photos uses which is I can create a</p>
      <p begin="00:21:44.410" end="00:21:48.060">...a secondary...which is actually this pane over here with collections</p>
      <p begin="00:21:48.060" end="00:21:53.530">through settings and I can take that...based on my size I can basically put</p>
      <p begin="00:21:53.530" end="00:21:57.490">it into a overlay mode and make it pop out there secondary</p>
      <p begin="00:21:57.490" end="00:22:04.380">affords and I'm going to just quickly just jump over and show you that same experience.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:04.380" end="00:22:09.400">Running here on my phone this is you can see from...running the exact same photos app is the photos app</p>
      <p begin="00:22:09.400" end="00:22:14.100">...comes in-box you can see here microsoft where we're going to kool-aid the same</p>
      <p begin="00:22:14.100" end="00:22:18.280">app here clear...same app...experience same stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:22:18.280" end="00:22:22.970">...the default experience I get here is that everything on my phone which you can see on</p>
      <p begin="00:22:22.970" end="00:22:26.720">the screen experience the default experience I get here is there's less space so</p>
      <p begin="00:22:26.720" end="00:22:30.550">...smaller images and...go into an overlay mode further if you will</p>
      <p begin="00:22:30.550" end="00:22:35.400">their split view so what we've done in the...we've tried to look at those kinds of patterns and</p>
      <p begin="00:22:35.400" end="00:22:43.240">we said hey what can we do to make it easier for developers to build those kind of patterns.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:43.240" end="00:22:45.760">So, jumping back to my</p>
      <p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:50.700">mind dec here there's a couple things that we've done and the first one I just did</p>
      <p begin="00:22:50.700" end="00:22:54.820">this the first one is the split view which I just talked about and just</p>
      <p begin="00:22:54.820" end="00:22:58.190">a demo of so on...a lot of time here but there's really said</p>
      <p begin="00:22:58.190" end="00:23:02.740">...a secondary...which you can kind of hide and make fly out ...there's a</p>
      <p begin="00:23:02.740" end="00:23:07.540">primary content area but the other thing is that you start thinking how...as developer</p>
      <p begin="00:23:07.540" end="00:23:12.200">...powerless how're...where you rules so you just writing code that says look</p>
      <p begin="00:23:12.200" end="00:23:16.350">at windows size and when I see windows size do this or their better</p>
      <p begin="00:23:16.350" end="00:23:21.890">way to do that sort of thing so what we've done is we've kinda looked at other solutions in the industry</p>
      <p begin="00:23:21.890" end="00:23:27.730">we thought a lot about it so we've got this new feature which is basically adaptive triggers</p>
      <p begin="00:23:27.730" end="00:23:32.670">and setters or it's really an extension of the sm for people on the web world</p>
      <p begin="00:23:32.670" end="00:23:37.620">are kinda used to media queries it's like annexed really extensible version of that but effectively</p>
      <p begin="00:23:37.620" end="00:23:43.280">use a developer can set up rules in here as an...trigger that says we have</p>
      <p begin="00:23:43.280" end="00:23:47.660">built-in size rules like when the windows this size do that...effectively with what you</p>
      <p begin="00:23:47.660" end="00:23:51.870">can with the rules but the declarative so one they're easy to define</p>
      <p begin="00:23:51.870" end="00:23:56.280">and to the design tool can actually help you do this and I'll say in</p>
      <p begin="00:23:56.280" end="00:23:59.720">the current version the designer helping you do this</p>
      <p begin="00:23:59.720" end="00:24:04.410">or that design solution for this is not online yet but that the reason that we've done</p>
      <p begin="00:24:04.410" end="00:24:09.240">a declarative...so the designer can actually do this so what the rules are saying here the bottom</p>
      <p begin="00:24:09.240" end="00:24:10.780">role is saying effectively</p>
      <p begin="00:24:10.780" end="00:24:15.360">hey when my sizes between zero and seven twenty which is the top</p>
      <p begin="00:24:15.360" end="00:24:19.280">role I want to set the set of properties but I want to do these actions and...top</p>
      <p begin="00:24:19.280" end="00:24:24.240">one is saying seven twenty beyond do these sets of actions now the trigger itself I said we</p>
      <p begin="00:24:24.240" end="00:24:28.430">built-in with rules screen with rules but there's a talk tomorrow</p>
      <p begin="00:24:28.430" end="00:24:33.250">by team your and hurriedly we're going to talk about this and much more detail they're going to talk about how you</p>
      <p begin="00:24:33.250" end="00:24:38.250">can actually create and define your own triggers and then you can define</p>
      <p begin="00:24:38.250" end="00:24:41.780">own rules for what happens when one of those triggers is actually hit so this</p>
      <p begin="00:24:41.780" end="00:24:46.730">is a really super powerful way...really easily define the rules that allow you to sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:24:46.730" end="00:24:51.730">adaptor app so the other thing we've done?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:51.730" end="00:24:56.640">Is I'm in a jump back star for the disjoint nature here let's jump</p>
      <p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:25:01.080">back and look at while I'm on the phone here I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:25:01.080" end="00:25:04.170">a pop-up settings...see that comes up quickly?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:04.170" end="00:25:06.520">If it does.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:06.520" end="00:25:09.520">Here's settings this little thing a settings on my phone and</p>
      <p begin="00:25:09.520" end="00:25:12.190">...to bring up settings.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.190" end="00:25:15.700">On my big display now mega hey those</p>
      <p begin="00:25:15.700" end="00:25:20.490">are different experiences but I'm going to resize on and boom</p>
      <p begin="00:25:20.490" end="00:25:23.280">the desktop one actually just turned into it's the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:23.280" end="00:25:27.280">same app even again I'm windows were doing the exact same thing it's just when I sizes smaller</p>
      <p begin="00:25:28.700" end="00:25:33.050">it reacts differently it lays out differently but this is a little more advanced than what I showed</p>
      <p begin="00:25:33.050" end="00:25:37.390">before split view and what's the more...if you see find a setting here one thing</p>
      <p begin="00:25:37.390" end="00:25:41.980">is watched the text you see it pops up so it kind of moves...kind of changes</p>
      <p begin="00:25:41.980" end="00:25:45.820">their bit the other one is other than this icon being different</p>
      <p begin="00:25:45.820" end="00:25:50.750">has its phone all the rest of the same you can see on in the phone is</p>
      <p begin="00:25:50.750" end="00:25:55.950">icon text next to it kind of two-column layout and my phone just went to sleep</p>
      <p begin="00:25:57.040" end="00:26:00.360">...and on desktop watch when I switch.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:05.780">The mode is now I've gone exact same tax but now it's kind of in a vertical layout so</p>
      <p begin="00:26:05.780" end="00:26:10.890">here I've done a actual layout switch rather than just a simple setting a</p>
      <p begin="00:26:10.890" end="00:26:16.600">property switch so what we've done in ten</p>
      <p begin="00:26:16.600" end="00:26:22.160">Again, taking a look at that is we've added a new panel to help assist</p>
      <p begin="00:26:22.160" end="00:26:26.940">in those kind of scenarios so...familiar with android they might be familiar with</p>
      <p begin="00:26:26.940" end="00:26:32.170">...relative panel layout that they have their kind of a similar thing so this is showing us</p>
      <p begin="00:26:32.170" end="00:26:37.450">my actually next sample that I'm going to show if you're sample developer you probably</p>
      <p begin="00:26:37.450" end="00:26:41.820">tried to lay something out like this before using some combo of grids</p>
      <p begin="00:26:41.820" end="00:26:45.680">in stack panels and even then you may not be able to get quite right so</p>
      <p begin="00:26:45.680" end="00:26:49.790">that looks pretty simple it's just an image with three things text in a button</p>
      <p begin="00:26:49.790" end="00:26:53.840">...they want to get that button aligned to the bottom or things like that can sometimes be</p>
      <p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:26:58.010">...a bit of a challenge and it does require what we call nested</p>
      <p begin="00:26:58.010" end="00:27:04.170">panels and nested panel's aren't necessarily a bad thing but it turns out if</p>
      <p begin="00:27:04.170" end="00:27:08.820">you're displaying hundreds of images your creating a lot of extra elements if</p>
      <p begin="00:27:08.820" end="00:27:13.680">you will and as a...is are and curing kumar doing a talk I think tomorrow</p>
      <p begin="00:27:13.680" end="00:27:17.720">we're talking about perf if you want to...as fast as possible if you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:27:17.720" end="00:27:22.080">pan as fast as possible these little things about using extra elements can start</p>
      <p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:26.800">to slow you down so what would be great would be if there was a better way to define this and that's what</p>
      <p begin="00:27:26.800" end="00:27:30.740">relative...about so take the exact same layout image?</p>
      <p begin="00:27:32.040" end="00:27:37.990">Now I can add my next text block and I say hey I want this to be to the right</p>
      <p begin="00:27:37.990" end="00:27:42.930">of the image and aligned with the top the image and I want my</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42.930" end="00:27:50.230">authors to be aligned to the right the image and below the title.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:50.230" end="00:27:59.220">It took me for somebody has to asleep and I clearly am.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:59.220" end="00:28:05.640">Okay, that was the previous one I showed which was the nested...moving forward.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:05.640" end="00:28:11.240">this is relative panel image on the left so the same view that I previously</p>
      <p begin="00:28:11.240" end="00:28:15.050">showed...like how do you can...I was trying to do...since I didn't.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:15.050" end="00:28:18.950">...trying to show how to build this experience off on the right and the first slide</p>
      <p begin="00:28:18.950" end="00:28:23.440">...showing how you would do this using grid...stack panels which is the traditional way might do it</p>
      <p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:28.410">...and it's hard to do things like align the bottom button some shown exact same experience and how</p>
      <p begin="00:28:28.410" end="00:28:33.160">you build it using relative panel and with relative panel you would use</p>
      <p begin="00:28:34.350" end="00:28:39.360">...stick your image in it you would say my text blocks title and you would say is</p>
      <p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:40.470">...of the image</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.470" end="00:28:44.810">...with the top of the image and the next text block is just aligned to</p>
      <p begin="00:28:44.810" end="00:28:50.060">the ready image again and below the previous one same thing with summary</p>
      <p begin="00:28:50.060" end="00:28:54.760">of the image but below the authors and in the last one the button a is to the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:54.760" end="00:28:58.690">...image but alignment...I could do with the bottom of the panel or to the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58.690" end="00:29:03.060">right image so really more complex layout but easier to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:03.060" end="00:29:07.520">do with relatively out panel and then you start thinking about this...the setter thing</p>
      <p begin="00:29:07.520" end="00:29:12.370">I talked about before the kinds of wild things that you could do in terms</p>
      <p begin="00:29:12.370" end="00:29:17.760">of in response to something like a layout change become super powerful to be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:22.260">changer layouts dynamically previously you might have had to do some weird stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:29:22.260" end="00:29:26.160">...changing columns and that sort of thing...in a grid no longer</p>
      <p begin="00:29:26.160" end="00:29:30.750">you-can use this and it turns out it solves the kind of scenarios that I previously showed</p>
      <p begin="00:29:30.750" end="00:29:38.110">with settings so with that I actually want to show jump back to do this correct this time?</p>
      <p begin="00:29:38.110" end="00:29:43.050">I will jump back to my demo machine and let's go ahead and just show you this</p>
      <p begin="00:29:43.050" end="00:29:46.620">stuff in real action here as I get rid of all this.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:46.620" end="00:29:52.420">And, get rid of my previous one...open a project.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:52.420" end="00:29:55.800">And, effectively this-is.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:55.800" end="00:29:59.680">It's the simplest product you've ever seen it doesn't maybe you will look at think</p>
      <p begin="00:29:59.680" end="00:30:04.890">it's that simple but it turns out it really is super simple it is stack</p>
      <p begin="00:30:04.890" end="00:30:09.810">...top with an icon that's my ux affords for opening up you don't see anything here</p>
      <p begin="00:30:09.810" end="00:30:13.220">because it's all data bound for ava split view there's the panel</p>
      <p begin="00:30:13.220" end="00:30:15.970">...and there's the content area so let's go ahead and</p>
      <p begin="00:30:15.970" end="00:30:21.560">...all data bound from ...going data from a service the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:21.560" end="00:30:26.490">services filling up this list on the left and it's doing the same thing based on</p>
      <p begin="00:30:26.490" end="00:30:31.420">what I select here it's going off and grabbing a service and data binding this stuff...actually show you this</p>
      <p begin="00:30:31.420" end="00:30:35.640">animal for this is super simple literally it's less than a</p>
      <p begin="00:30:35.640" end="00:30:39.220">hundred lines of amr code to do all of this experience most people have used</p>
      <p begin="00:30:39.220" end="00:30:43.330">...for can contain that's not exaggeration so,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:43.330" end="00:30:47.860">...I want to show here is that you'll notice I'm running the same experience I showed</p>
      <p begin="00:30:47.860" end="00:30:53.750">in my the first demo I did with the controls and that as a resize this down</p>
      <p begin="00:30:53.750" end="00:30:57.950">...run on the phone you can see this experience one that doesn't</p>
      <p begin="00:30:57.950" end="00:31:01.320">gets I really like that to go in and overflow mode this but view</p>
      <p begin="00:31:01.320" end="00:31:05.990">to you can see that text does not look ideal here so it</p>

      <p begin="00:31:11.900" end="00:31:16.030">those are two things I go, you know, I'd love to fix those and if you're...developer you</p>
      <p begin="00:31:16.030" end="00:31:20.380">...it how would you how would you do that in your app experience and</p>
      <p begin="00:31:20.380" end="00:31:26.120">I I'm guessing what you would probably do is going to be more complex...show you here maybe not this</p>
      <p begin="00:31:26.120" end="00:31:29.990">...clever people...docked people can come up with a</p>
      <p begin="00:31:29.990" end="00:31:34.150">saying that my expert this is really pretty simple there's a command</p>
      <p begin="00:31:34.150" end="00:31:36.600">...the bottom I've.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:36.600" end="00:31:40.950">Just had these just to make...easy-to-read but that's</p>
      <p begin="00:31:40.950" end="00:31:45.900">the details view that's the navigation pane right there data bound and this right</p>
      <p begin="00:31:45.900" end="00:31:50.320">here's the stack panel that holds my ux affords I said we didn't build in</p>
      <p begin="00:31:50.320" end="00:31:55.190">the hamburger pattern you actually have to add your ux affords I've added a three icon or</p>
      <p begin="00:31:55.190" end="00:31:59.730">three bar icon that opens and...that's really the only code of added here when I click that button</p>
      <p begin="00:31:59.730" end="00:32:03.870">...close so I pre can daniela thing in here is</p>
      <p begin="00:32:03.870" end="00:32:07.930">...canned in those visual stateside to showed you so</p>
      <p begin="00:32:07.930" end="00:32:12.680">on uncommon it and what I've...wired up here it's the only thing I've changed here is I've just</p>
      <p begin="00:32:12.680" end="00:32:17.340">added these new visual triggers and I say here is...my sizes</p>
      <p begin="00:32:17.340" end="00:32:22.960">between zero and seven twenty that I want my display mode</p>
      <p begin="00:32:22.960" end="00:32:27.740">basically the overlay and I want to...default to closed and</p>
      <p begin="00:32:27.740" end="00:32:32.250">...seven twenty above make it open and I could do this and say I want only...that</p>
      <p begin="00:32:32.250" end="00:32:36.910">...mobile I could add my own if you will triggers that are not just min width</p>
      <p begin="00:32:36.910" end="00:32:40.190">...could be something else but, now just keep it simple I've just done</p>
      <p begin="00:32:40.190" end="00:32:45.610">it based on size so that was step a that I wanted to fix and?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:45.610" end="00:32:50.360">I'll just because it won't take me much to show you that on desktop and I'll come back and</p>
      <p begin="00:32:50.360" end="00:32:56.330">showdown phone so just run it now with those couple lines of code.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:56.330" end="00:33:01.180">Boom that simple super use do that...changed really there's nothing up nicely</p>
      <p begin="00:33:01.180" end="00:33:05.600">that was all it took so just to keep it real I'm going to show you one</p>
      <p begin="00:33:05.600" end="00:33:10.130">more but this one and trying to.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:10.130" end="00:33:14.670">Show you real experience hear this second one is in a data...people,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:14.670" end="00:33:17.740">for example, no, that's a way that you generate ui in a</p>
      <p begin="00:33:17.740" end="00:33:22.690">data bound way right now we have not wired up the triggers yet</p>
      <p begin="00:33:22.690" end="00:33:27.200">to work and data templates but so like I said I'm try to keep</p>
      <p begin="00:33:27.200" end="00:33:32.000">...real but how to get around that most really simple all it is</p>
      <p begin="00:33:32.000" end="00:33:36.410">...blank user control for...user controls</p>
      <p begin="00:33:36.410" end="00:33:40.960">other ways you can create you reusable components of ui example but this is</p>
      <p begin="00:33:40.960" end="00:33:44.510">an empty blank user control I'm just going to take my data template</p>
      <p begin="00:33:44.510" end="00:33:48.890">...on my data template.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:48.890" end="00:33:53.710">Stop...your demo okay let's go back I just want</p>
      <p begin="00:33:53.710" end="00:33:57.490">my relative panel that's all I want.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:57.490" end="00:34:03.170">Thank you and go back to my view I just want the relative panel.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:03.170" end="00:34:09.690">That's it that looks good and now my user control is named.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:09.690" end="00:34:14.550">Book item view so local.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:14.550" end="00:34:16.070">All I did is I just shove that in</p>
      <p begin="00:34:16.070" end="00:34:20.970">the user control my apple now run exactly the same way that's all I did.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:20.970" end="00:34:23.320">But, I want to show you that.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:23.320" end="00:34:28.020">Additional piece of adaptability so let's go ahead and copy what I did</p>
      <p begin="00:34:28.020" end="00:34:33.609">...put inbook item view at the beginning here.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:33.609" end="00:34:39.369">But, I don't really want to split view display mode I want to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:39.369" end="00:34:44.209">I want to fix that text overflow problem so that text is actually it's this property here</p>
      <p begin="00:34:44.209" end="00:34:49.029">summary that's that one it tends to get long and what I would like to do is I would just like to set the</p>
      <p begin="00:34:49.029" end="00:34:51.109">maximum...line some ado summary?</p>
      <p begin="00:34:52.249" end="00:34:55.319">Of a set max lines.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:55.319" end="00:34:59.309">...normal situational save five sounds good and.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:59.309" end="00:35:04.039">Will copy that each and redo that same rule down below but in</p>
      <p begin="00:35:04.039" end="00:35:07.899">a zero to seven twenty case I want...science to bthree?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:07.899" end="00:35:12.289">And, let's go ahead and let's shoot for the whole ball of wax</p>
      <p begin="00:35:12.289" end="00:35:21.110">let's run this on mobile so you get to see the full experience on mobile.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:21.110" end="00:35:24.500">Yes, I do want to project.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:24.500" end="00:35:27.730">So, if you remember before it would come up side-by-side</p>
      <p begin="00:35:27.730" end="00:35:32.000">but mobile now you can see I'm not side-by-side awesome and</p>
      <p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:35.790">look at the text up something didn't work.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:35.790" end="00:35:36.510">Look, at that.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:37.520" end="00:35:41.430">What did I do wrong?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:41.430" end="00:35:47.470">Thank you love having a smart audience it is...</p>
      <p begin="00:35:47.470" end="00:35:50.880">Thank you rain man.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:50.880" end="00:35:55.760">I only know avce no fence it's...argue that.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:36:02.300">If ...money back at the back I'm sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:02.300" end="00:36:07.220">There thank you thank you that person over there...help with my demo so,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:07.220" end="00:36:13.970">there you see it now on here I see the get there.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:13.970" end="00:36:17.920">Okay, I saw it I was excited.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:17.920" end="00:36:23.930">...my trick was to pretend like it was working it really wasn't so boy see I love</p>
      <p begin="00:36:23.930" end="00:36:28.140">my technology is so cool so there you see now see now you can</p>
      <p begin="00:36:28.140" end="00:36:33.180">...yeah, this is a.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.180" end="00:36:38.910">And, it really was it really was that simple to do I really try to take a real sample to build that</p>
      <p begin="00:36:38.910" end="00:36:44.480">out for people who care I have one more...that I'm not going to make now but it's the same I do a</p>
      <p begin="00:36:44.480" end="00:36:49.870">couple more lines and actually move that ux affords from the top-down into the command bar</p>
      <p begin="00:36:49.870" end="00:36:53.940">went on...same using the same trigger for people who really want to make</p>
      <p begin="00:36:53.940" end="00:36:58.590">sure ux that don't like hamburger and the reaching...with hamburger have a command</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.590" end="00:37:03.830">are down here and I just...the ux affords down there under the same trigger it was super</p>
      <p begin="00:37:03.830" end="00:37:08.460">easy to do so with that let me switch back and.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:08.460" end="00:37:13.210">Go...powerpoint and talk about some other things that we've done.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:13.210" end="00:37:16.600">My on the right thing yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:16.600" end="00:37:22.190">So, performance I mention there is a talk tomorrow on performance by...and</p>
      <p begin="00:37:22.190" end="00:37:26.060">...kumar and one thing about performance</p>
      <p begin="00:37:26.060" end="00:37:31.260">that is interesting is that I mention that all of our experiences kind of moved over to</p>
      <p begin="00:37:31.260" end="00:37:35.080">example and that's really great for everybody and that now when you see something</p>
      <p begin="00:37:35.080" end="00:37:40.260">...hey, you know, you should be able to the exact same thing there was no cheating internally</p>
      <p begin="00:37:40.260" end="00:37:44.520">by providing the first parser general experiences and...them to do something you</p>
      <p begin="00:37:44.520" end="00:37:49.520">...third-party can't do but the side effect for our team was that's good for you is that</p>
      <p begin="00:37:49.520" end="00:37:54.170">hey that the shells running all the times run twenty four seven and that thing when I had to start</p>
      <p begin="00:37:54.170" end="00:37:59.800">menu that starts being better come up and better not be taken on my memory...the system and,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:59.800" end="00:38:05.000">I...better be blazing the fast so before when the shells</p>
      <p begin="00:38:05.000" end="00:38:10.390">...sort of default to having their own framework in some cases it allowed us to</p>
      <p begin="00:38:10.390" end="00:38:15.470">not necessarily keep the performance metrics we would need for really super high-performance</p>
      <p begin="00:38:15.470" end="00:38:19.580">needs like the shell so what we did is we had to spend a lot of time on just</p>
      <p begin="00:38:19.580" end="00:38:24.310">makings animal as lean and trim as possible.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:24.310" end="00:38:29.110">And, with that there's a set of things and I guess I don't talk about my next slide but</p>
      <p begin="00:38:29.110" end="00:38:32.200">mark internal talk about there's a set of things that if you just take your existing</p>
      <p begin="00:38:32.200" end="00:38:36.420">aone app and run on windows ten it's faster because we just had to do a bunch of</p>
      <p begin="00:38:36.420" end="00:38:42.090">just general performance stuff in the engine there's another set of things when you recompile for windows</p>
      <p begin="00:38:42.090" end="00:38:47.000">...app gets faster and that's because when you compile we kind of turn example into a</p>
      <p begin="00:38:47.000" end="00:38:51.790">fast node stream and we made that...so much better on windows ten after</p>
      <p begin="00:38:51.790" end="00:38:56.550">we target to get that up so it's really a much more better binary format if you will and</p>
      <p begin="00:38:56.550" end="00:39:00.940">then there were some things where we just couldn't find any way to just make it implicit</p>
      <p begin="00:39:00.940" end="00:39:07.000">and we had to have people opt into so there's one of those I want to talk about because it turns out the side effect of</p>
      <p begin="00:39:07.000" end="00:39:11.280">it's actually really good developer value...something called compile bindings so</p>
      <p begin="00:39:11.280" end="00:39:15.770">what are things we noticed is bindings are inherently string based in anybody</p>
      <p begin="00:39:15.770" end="00:39:20.730">whose had a binding where they...the name wrong and everything compiled and worked in your apt</p>
      <p begin="00:39:20.730" end="00:39:25.270">in runny didn't know why because runtime we're doing to look up and if the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:25.270" end="00:39:29.230">look up doesn't work sometimes return exception...sometimes you never see it and,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:29.230" end="00:39:32.680">it can be painful but also guess what it can be slow</p>
      <p begin="00:39:32.680" end="00:39:36.120">...actually using reflection to do that look up and attic cpu and</p>
      <p begin="00:39:36.120" end="00:39:41.560">that takes memory so, our first thought was which is a great thought we said</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.560" end="00:39:45.730">bindings...evil let's have nobody used bindings and everything</p>
      <p begin="00:39:45.730" end="00:39:50.170">...get faster and you think I'm joking and?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:50.170" end="00:39:55.070">We're I going are developers...smartness cplus-plus guys of get it guys and gals emit</p>
      <p begin="00:39:55.070" end="00:39:58.900">...a general mutual general term so,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:58.900" end="00:40:02.300">again, the...money back sorry about that so,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:02.300" end="00:40:08.000">we literally did...we actually said don't...bindings but we've been told</p>
      <p begin="00:40:08.000" end="00:40:13.180">...still do it cycle this is not working what can we do so after some</p>
      <p begin="00:40:13.180" end="00:40:17.940">thinking it turns out that we can actually result bindings...compile-time we can basically just turn</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.940" end="00:40:22.500">them into loosely property sets we change notification we need to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:22.500" end="00:40:27.220">...it turns out not only that a lot faster and a lot faster it turns</p>
      <p begin="00:40:27.220" end="00:40:38.980">out when you type name wrong...your binding you now get a compiler check.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:38.980" end="00:40:45.390">other things that fell out now it's pretty easy for us to just wire up go ahead one so,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:45.390" end="00:40:48.760">effectively what you need to do to move the bindings is we did have to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:48.760" end="00:40:53.630">change the syntax but we try to keep it as compatible as possible you do have to say</p>
      <p begin="00:40:53.630" end="00:40:58.440">...data template you may have to say here's my type combining...which you should know what your type is</p>
      <p begin="00:40:58.440" end="00:41:03.320">...than that you just change binding the x columbine and now though side effect</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03.320" end="00:41:08.220">that to is audio compile-time checking things like event handlers</p>
      <p begin="00:41:08.220" end="00:41:12.960">you can now wire up directly with x combined so we actually have new features in</p>
      <p begin="00:41:12.960" end="00:41:18.140">there as well so this is as I said it start out as a perf feature started as we try to kill</p>
      <p begin="00:41:18.140" end="00:41:23.220">a feature and end up as a pretty nice feature that we all feel pretty good about it so definitely try that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:23.220" end="00:41:26.400">out the...spencer I think as a talk right after this where he's</p>
      <p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:31.100">...into we deep on this one other nice side effect of this</p>
      <p begin="00:41:31.100" end="00:41:34.990">is I mention we compile-time we generate all this we actually</p>
      <p begin="00:41:34.990" end="00:41:40.140">...a form of cs files you can actually single step to your bindings now the code that we used</p>
      <p begin="00:41:40.140" end="00:41:45.100">to do reflection those hidden in the framework you can actually step through now to see what's going on with your</p>
      <p begin="00:41:45.100" end="00:41:51.340">binding so super powerful love the feature so other things we did that didn't fall out of</p>
      <p begin="00:41:51.340" end="00:41:57.300">perf this is just a smattering of...long list but just a set of</p>
      <p begin="00:41:57.300" end="00:42:02.600">for the highlights for people who have done tricks?</p>
      <p begin="00:42:02.600" end="00:42:06.300">In the past where they want to know in something changes like visibility on</p>

      <p begin="00:42:10.370" end="00:42:14.680">notification that property some people in the past and tricks where they hook up element,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:14.680" end="00:42:18.830">element binding to their own dp and figure out that way anyway so that's kinda of</p>
      <p begin="00:42:18.830" end="00:42:23.540">crazy we'll just have a property now on our all dp so you can basically</p>
      <p begin="00:42:23.540" end="00:42:28.290">hook change notification on pretty much any ui property now which again is something that we've</p>
      <p begin="00:42:28.290" end="00:42:34.340">heard lots of people ask for the past this next one if I if you are</p>
      <p begin="00:42:34.340" end="00:42:39.130">...have windows ten installed and...hit the start screen when it first comes up you see all the tiles</p>
      <p begin="00:42:39.130" end="00:42:43.420">...this fancy three-d stuff and some people maybe going hey but you support perspective</p>
      <p begin="00:42:43.420" end="00:42:48.400">transform we do in the thing about perspective transform as you can transform anyone element</p>
      <p begin="00:42:48.400" end="00:42:53.060">in three-d space you want to do multiple elements in three-d space you transform both of them</p>
      <p begin="00:42:53.060" end="00:42:57.860">and then if you want to animate those you have to separate animations rn animations to animate</p>
      <p begin="00:42:57.860" end="00:43:02.600">all of those you want to do some kind of camera on top of those good luck you better be</p>
      <p begin="00:43:02.600" end="00:43:06.600">a rocket scientist because it's really hard so we basically have a compose</p>
      <p begin="00:43:06.600" end="00:43:11.380">...way to do that where you can sort of said if you will camera and you could set perspectives</p>
      <p begin="00:43:11.380" end="00:43:15.740">at multiple levels which makes these kinds of things so much easier</p>
      <p begin="00:43:15.740" end="00:43:19.670">and I won't show...a demo this I'll just show you the demo and probably not going</p>
      <p begin="00:43:19.670" end="00:43:25.970">to code that it super easy might my demos actually all market demo?</p>

      <p begin="00:43:34.300" end="00:43:38.830">But, as part of that so you expect now to be able to custom chrome but if you're going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:43:38.830" end="00:43:43.040">doing custom chrome user way we can...that up and hey,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:46.330">there is a actually away it's really easy you first of all it's easy</p>
      <p begin="00:43:46.330" end="00:43:51.140">to branding on your chrome you cannot change the background foregone color but</p>
      <p begin="00:43:51.140" end="00:43:55.640">you take a step further you can actually define a little example snippet in your</p>
      <p begin="00:43:56.750" end="00:44:00.710">page and you can basically annotate that example snippet and you can</p>
      <p begin="00:44:00.710" end="00:44:05.650">say hey please use this example as my custom chrome and you put that</p>
      <p begin="00:44:05.650" end="00:44:07.800">anywhere your page actually and that's the</p>
      <p begin="00:44:07.800" end="00:44:12.160">thing that you can use to move around your app and resize your app</p>
      <p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:16.560">...powerful...to custom chrome you can do it just using declared</p>
      <p begin="00:44:16.560" end="00:44:19.800">...market then I'll actually show you a demo</p>
      <p begin="00:44:19.800" end="00:44:24.920">...exactly just that and it...hard so here's</p>
      <p begin="00:44:24.920" end="00:44:30.840">...creepy christmas photo to me but this is just showing we added</p>

      <p begin="00:44:42.500" end="00:44:46.010">it's not always the easiest thing so ...kind of</p>

      <p begin="00:45:03.370" end="00:45:07.960">there's a talk that talks about this in a lot of detail you get the strokes and smoothing lots</p>
      <p begin="00:45:07.960" end="00:45:14.190">of stuff it's really cool it's really super powerful and drag-and-drop they</p>
      <p begin="00:45:14.190" end="00:45:18.450">showed this morning in the keynote drag-and-drop super easy now we can</p>
      <p begin="00:45:18.450" end="00:45:22.870">drag from the desktop drop in your app advice for students see of people</p>
      <p begin="00:45:22.870" end="00:45:24.770">...wintry to drag-and-drop this</p>
      <p begin="00:45:24.770" end="00:45:30.740">is like that only easier it's just super simple to do so with that let's see I got</p>
      <p begin="00:45:30.740" end="00:45:37.240">forty minutes to get one more good demo that I want to show after I show you this over here my last demos</p>
      <p begin="00:45:37.240" end="00:45:40.950">...funnel demo?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:40.950" end="00:45:44.700">Which is not this one this one's not bad either?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.700" end="00:45:50.610">Ok, so, everybody can see good.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:50.610" end="00:45:58.870">Want to make the same mistake again will coliseum this one.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:58.870" end="00:46:01.060">So, what I've done here you see</p>
      <p begin="00:46:01.060" end="00:46:03.930">and design view is basically?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:05.650" end="00:46:09.170">Run this app.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:09.170" end="00:46:13.780">I basically taken and use the perspective transform.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:13.780" end="00:46:17.150">And, now, for example, is all mark-up except for doing the animation</p>
      <p begin="00:46:18.200" end="00:46:22.840">it super simple to do and you're seeing some drawing artifacts but it's all</p>
      <p begin="00:46:22.840" end="00:46:26.390">these are real three-d cubes and</p>
      <p begin="00:46:26.390" end="00:46:30.920">...so simple to do this...each one is cubes is...analyst</p>
      <p begin="00:46:30.920" end="00:46:35.370">reused but, these sort of experiences become super simple with a new three-d api</p>
      <p begin="00:46:35.370" end="00:46:40.940">...and here's my custom chrome that's just image element example that I</p>
      <p begin="00:46:40.940" end="00:46:45.540">said action...an icon...example that I just said hey please use this</p>
      <p begin="00:46:45.540" end="00:46:50.010">as my chrome and that's my chrome that's our move us...size and</p>
      <p begin="00:46:50.010" end="00:46:55.080">it's in the sample is so simple it's really I liked it</p>
      <p begin="00:46:55.080" end="00:47:01.530">...to tell you that it super hard but it turns out that it's actually not super hard to do and,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:01.530" end="00:47:06.440">all my main heavy lifting the top is all this is basically what</p>
      <p begin="00:47:06.440" end="00:47:10.290">...use display each one of those cubes the top...my animation but this is</p>
      <p begin="00:47:10.290" end="00:47:13.850">...right here it's this code you just creating the sides?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:13.850" end="00:47:19.180">Each one of those a...that's all it is and I'm just putting a transform and each one and</p>
      <p begin="00:47:19.180" end="00:47:24.600">animated...layer higher so it's really turns out it's super easy to do but what I want to do is</p>
      <p begin="00:47:24.600" end="00:47:30.590">on keep this running because I want to use this for my next</p>
      <p begin="00:47:30.590" end="00:47:38.470">But, I'll get back to powerpoint intro my next demo which would be my final one.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:38.470" end="00:47:41.920">So, we've done a bunch of enhancements to you saw the new</p>
      <p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:45.880">...with the edge engine today so it's no longer project spartan but I didn't</p>
      <p begin="00:47:45.880" end="00:47:49.700">update this slide...left in the teaser...</p>
      <p begin="00:47:50.760" end="00:47:54.280">Anyway, my own clever trick that's not very clever but,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:54.280" end="00:47:58.770">anyway, there's a bunch of enhancements the access you...when rt that they showed today</p>
      <p begin="00:47:58.770" end="00:48:02.870">...the keynote us...am...can host a web view and that web</p>
      <p begin="00:48:02.870" end="00:48:07.850">...turn-around access when rt but there's a bunch of other things that have been down to the web view there's</p>
      <p begin="00:48:07.850" end="00:48:12.540">a session tomorrow I believe kevin hill or somebody can tell me when it is I think</p>
      <p begin="00:48:12.540" end="00:48:18.100">we're sitting over here there's...talks about all the new great stuff that's...the web you control that applied</p>
      <p begin="00:48:18.100" end="00:48:23.060">years am lap and then there are some improvements</p>
      <p begin="00:48:23.060" end="00:48:25.250">...visual studio you saw</p>
      <p begin="00:48:25.250" end="00:48:34.210">a little bit today I think about how you can resize your experience...</p>
      <p begin="00:48:34.210" end="00:48:40.540">You can resize the experience in the designer its this experience here.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:40.540" end="00:48:45.110">Since we only have one universal app now you can preview it on hey what is a...on</p>
      <p begin="00:48:45.110" end="00:48:46.220">...phone which this does work on</p>
      <p begin="00:48:46.220" end="00:48:49.150">the phone and that's fit to screen.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:50.250" end="00:48:51.150">But, you can oahu.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:52.550" end="00:48:54.510">That's not what I wanted</p>
      <p begin="00:48:54.510" end="00:48:59.450">...goes sixty hello there it's in there somewhere okay...pick...pick io</p>
      <p begin="00:48:59.450" end="00:49:05.530">...or I mean a surface.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:05.530" end="00:49:09.160">...should...there is so gives an idea of what would look like</p>
      <p begin="00:49:09.160" end="00:49:14.010">...surface habit there's some features like this where you can do portrait landscape across all the devices</p>
      <p begin="00:49:14.010" end="00:49:18.880">in design view since you don't have individual ones.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:22.730">And, I'll come back to that later show you a different demo on that same</p>
      <p begin="00:49:22.730" end="00:49:25.110">one so that's.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:26.330" end="00:49:31.050">That's one of the things that we've done we've also done a new...the first image</p>
      <p begin="00:49:31.050" end="00:49:33.380">...timeline tool which I think martin</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.380" end="00:49:36.720">...talk about...the...tools and greatly enhanced</p>
      <p begin="00:49:36.720" end="00:49:42.220">and super powerful but the last...of...and on...kind of a fun little one which is</p>
      <p begin="00:49:42.220" end="00:49:50.770">a visual tree inspector so let me just show you that in action.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:50.770" end="00:49:59.990">So, people who are you know, use we use web tools will know that.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:59.990" end="00:50:14.150">what cfb confuse myself here okay where is my.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:14.150" end="00:50:17.280">Boy what have I done.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:17.280" end="00:50:21.640">I just turned off my view that I wanted and you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:21.640" end="00:50:29.810">what you would...I know-how to turn it back on that?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:29.810" end="00:50:36.180">Windows live asks.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:41.470" end="00:50:45.530">...now we're getting back in.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:45.530" end="00:50:49.560">You know, what while I'm doing this actually let me show you a different...show</p>
      <p begin="00:50:49.560" end="00:51:00.430">the feature different way you can tell me whether this is good or not...you show you my previous app?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:00.430" end="00:51:02.330">And, I'm going to attach.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:02.330" end="00:51:16.180">Again, you tell me this is a good thing or not.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:16.180" end="00:51:19.210">...I just did.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:19.210" end="00:51:24.280">...some...ds in a way that's like that's not a good thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:24.280" end="00:51:30.110">Seymour positively I feel better about my demo right now yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:30.110" end="00:51:36.150">effectively you get to see primarily in your app this is not the</p>
      <p begin="00:51:36.150" end="00:51:41.040">...would only be good in this kind of experience if you want to go I want to know what icon they're using</p>
      <p begin="00:51:41.040" end="00:51:46.790">not if you want to know how they're actually doing it this is a really great thing in your own app experience</p>
      <p begin="00:51:46.790" end="00:51:51.660">...how is that margin words that margin getting set because what this does it basically gives you the full</p>
      <p begin="00:51:51.660" end="00:51:57.740">if you will example visual tree and that's what you see anal left here and what you can do which is</p>
      <p begin="00:51:57.740" end="00:52:02.290">what...my previous app experience is you can actually go and select individual item and go</p>
      <p begin="00:52:02.290" end="00:52:06.830">hey so what's the what's the color they use on that fonts?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:06.830" end="00:52:10.900">And, you can actually find out it's solid color brush.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:10.900" end="00:52:15.130">And, there's the actual color use apparently transparent but you can</p>
      <p begin="00:52:15.130" end="00:52:19.890">act and you can actually interact with it so I can change.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:19.890" end="00:52:23.580">Real time to go hey.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:23.580" end="00:52:26.130">...I picked the wrong one I'm going I'm going to,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:26.130" end="00:52:32.490">you know, I'm going to go back to my other app because that's the one I knew how to do this since I got...</p>
      <p begin="00:52:32.490" end="00:52:35.230">Nope, not that one.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:35.230" end="00:52:38.560">That's that one of work.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:38.560" end="00:52:42.470">It will work.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:42.470" end="00:52:47.630">Because primarily the big value is a lot of times people who are familiar and use animal sometimes are going</p>
      <p begin="00:52:47.630" end="00:52:51.320">...what is going on here how is that.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:51.320" end="00:52:56.490">How is that getting set and this will tell you whether it's coming from a style there we go so,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:56.490" end="00:52:58.890">let's go ahead and I could...like how is</p>
      <p begin="00:52:58.890" end="00:53:03.840">...soon how is that...said and what is it and you'll see a</p>
      <p begin="00:53:03.840" end="00:53:06.340">keep for myself by?</p>
      <p begin="00:53:06.340" end="00:53:08.430">Changing my chrome.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:08.430" end="00:53:13.950">it over here the visual tree inspector will tell me what was text blocking tell me what size it is</p>
      <p begin="00:53:13.950" end="00:53:18.420">...whether not set from a style and I must...clicked on something else I</p>
      <p begin="00:53:18.420" end="00:53:23.560">...this is great for multi monde it's kind of tougher with single on term</p>
      <p begin="00:53:23.560" end="00:53:28.920">iverson it tells me it's set from style.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:28.920" end="00:53:34.760">In apt...tells me all the settings...that style but...I want to show you two is I clicked on</p>
      <p begin="00:53:34.760" end="00:53:39.600">the image background and there's the transform three-d here and I'm going to set the z</p>
      <p begin="00:53:39.600" end="00:53:44.480">you can actually interact with it all set to minus three that's...four hundred.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:44.480" end="00:53:49.190">So, I just push that image back into it to show you the kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:53:49.190" end="00:53:53.880">affects you can generate with ...click on this which make my app go away but I'll just show you what I just</p>
      <p begin="00:53:53.880" end="00:53:58.870">did so real-time negative paradox effect going on because I just take that image with</p>
      <p begin="00:53:58.870" end="00:54:04.110">our new transform three-d stuff and I just pushed it back three hundred effective pixels in the</p>
      <p begin="00:54:04.110" end="00:54:06.590">...order and now you can say get this nice</p>
      <p begin="00:54:06.590" end="00:54:09.450">...clever experience but in general this debugging tool</p>
      <p begin="00:54:09.450" end="00:54:13.620">...super powerful I use it all the time distant even building simple apps remote why</p>
      <p begin="00:54:13.620" end="00:54:17.840">is that margin why is that...couple pixels and now you can go through</p>
      <p begin="00:54:17.840" end="00:54:22.930">and click on something go through the whole visual tree and sorry I got because I'm not multi</p>
      <p begin="00:54:22.930" end="00:54:27.880">monde I could go through the whole visual tree as text block within a lips on top of it</p>
      <p begin="00:54:27.880" end="00:54:32.160">...grid integrated...verbal size...create and I go any one of these</p>
      <p begin="00:54:32.160" end="00:54:37.280">and check what are the margins...the settings so becomes a super powerful way to figure out what's kind of really</p>
      <p begin="00:54:37.280" end="00:54:47.580">going on with your with your app and with that I think.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:47.580" end="00:54:52.500">Did that they're a bunch of other things that we've done...didn't go over but</p>
      <p begin="00:54:52.500" end="00:54:57.370">there are some cases these are covered by other session certainly be covered in the...but a lot of other things</p>
      <p begin="00:54:57.370" end="00:55:03.690">up in the on this related sessions listed here as I mentioned a couple</p>
      <p begin="00:55:03.690" end="00:55:06.780">these the data binding and zambia performance there's</p>
      <p begin="00:55:06.780" end="00:55:12.300">a hurrying tim gotta talk tomorrow on...adaptability in-depth?</p>
      <p begin="00:55:12.300" end="00:55:15.925">Session valuation please and with that thank</p>
      <p begin="00:55:15.925" end="00:55:24.530">you everybody appreciate you come and what about native ui?</p>
