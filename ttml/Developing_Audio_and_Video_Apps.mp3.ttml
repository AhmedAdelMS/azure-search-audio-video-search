      <p begin="00:00:05.440" end="00:00:07.110">As everyone...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.110" end="00:00:07.670">Thanks...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.670" end="00:00:12.620">out to the last the build conference really appreciate you guys being here who also the of</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.620" end="00:00:16.880">...last night...cool awesome hope you guys</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.880" end="00:00:21.860">have had a great time and I've seen a lot of powerpoint confess I've</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.860" end="00:00:26.960">got a few more slides for you but I've got a lot of cool demos going to spend a lot of time</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.960" end="00:00:31.710">in visual studio look at a lot of code for the slides I do have</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.710" end="00:00:38.800">you can rest assured that powerpoint was harmed in the making of this presentation.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.800" end="00:00:43.350">I'm david...program manager on the media team here at microsoft...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.350" end="00:00:48.230">only my privilege to be here today talking to you all about what we've done some make it easy</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.230" end="00:00:52.370">and awesome to build audio and video applications for</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.370" end="00:00:52.870">windows.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.220" end="00:00:58.590">...tell you review the session afterwards we really appreciate the</p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.590" end="00:01:03.150">feedback it helps us make sure that we can give you better and better presentations</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.150" end="00:01:06.520">image build conference so you could take a few moments will appreciate</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.520" end="00:01:12.580">it before we get into the content of the talk I wanted to take a moment and step back and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.580" end="00:01:16.670">reflect on what the goals that we had is immediate team were for windows</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.670" end="00:01:24.150">developers with windows time first and foremost we wanted to give you.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.150" end="00:01:28.660">What you asked for we heard a lot of feedback from you that things were hard that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:28.660" end="00:01:33.000">it could be easier if we could do a better job making use successful</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:35.530">...platforms we heard that feedback</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.530" end="00:01:40.440">wasn't always easy we heard a loud and clear we've listened to it and we've delivered on</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.440" end="00:01:43.240">it we've given you the top things that you ask for with windows</p>
      <p begin="00:01:43.240" end="00:01:47.880">...second you've heard about...a lot but it's critical is</p>
      <p begin="00:01:47.880" end="00:01:52.310">a shared goal with everyone here at microsoft to make it possible</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.310" end="00:01:56.300">for-you to write one piece of code the runs across all windows</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.300" end="00:02:01.170">our devices give you that reach and that scale that billion devices that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:01.170" end="00:02:04.420">...talked about the other day we believe is critical for making</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.420" end="00:02:09.950">...successful we want you to get the maximum return on your investments when you target</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.950" end="00:02:12.860">the windows platform and we've really taken that on</p>
      <p begin="00:02:12.860" end="00:02:17.950">is our mission within media deliver on that?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:17.950" end="00:02:22.190">Finally we want to allow you to focus on what makes your app</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.190" end="00:02:23.310">great.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.310" end="00:02:27.090">Media is a somewhat unique space and there's a lot of value</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.090" end="00:02:31.930">provided in a lot of different parts of the stack by a lot of different companies some companies</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.930" end="00:02:36.760">are really selling the content that they provide to users other companies are selling the services</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.760" end="00:02:41.550">and application development and even specific areas of that so we wanted to make</p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.550" end="00:02:46.360">it really easy...the language of your choice bid csharp javascript</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.360" end="00:02:51.170">cplus-plus whatever you prefer to focus on that unique value...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:51.170" end="00:02:56.080">your providing to the ecosystem what windows handle all the other stuff all that stuff that's</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.080" end="00:02:59.100">hard that you don't really want to be writing code for</p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.100" end="00:03:04.840">...taking on that work...making it easy for you to focus on your key value.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:04.840" end="00:03:09.270">So, we'll talk about today we'll spend the first half so talking about building</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.270" end="00:03:13.240">converge audio apps and how you can write that one audio app that runs on all</p>
      <p begin="00:03:13.240" end="00:03:13.740">devices?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:14.890" end="00:03:19.810">And, they will build on what we learned with the audio and talk about how you can add</p>
      <p begin="00:03:19.810" end="00:03:24.480">advanced video experiences...app...super easy we've taken things that used</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:27.660">to required thousands lines of code and dropped down into a</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.660" end="00:03:32.950">handful alliance some really excited thinking to level we have in-store.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:32.950" end="00:03:37.050">...want before we get into it as want to be really clear I get a lot of questions on</p>
      <p begin="00:03:37.050" end="00:03:41.800">...everything I show today runs on every single</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.800" end="00:03:46.530">device running windows ten with the universal windows platform everything I</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.530" end="00:03:51.060">show will run on devices from pc phone tablet xbox hollow</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.060" end="00:03:54.840">...whatever we come up with next you write this one</p>
      <p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:04:01.860">set of code it's going to run their...your customers are going to love it.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:01.860" end="00:04:06.760">When you think about building an audio application the first thing you really want to think about</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.760" end="00:04:10.260">is how you user is going to use that application?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:14.670">Most people probably almost every day with us and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14.670" end="00:04:19.340">music or other audio files on your pc what you do you go you load up</p>
      <p begin="00:04:19.340" end="00:04:23.420">your favorite app you set what you want to listen to be a some</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.420" end="00:04:26.590">cd content that you've...to your library files</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.590" end="00:04:31.780">...downloaded or streaming you set up whatever you want to listen to and then you go</p>
      <p begin="00:04:31.780" end="00:04:36.760">do something else you don't stay in that app you're going to be writing code...to be surfing</p>
      <p begin="00:04:36.760" end="00:04:41.700">the web maybe you're cooking dinner doesn't matter what you're doing all that matters is that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.700" end="00:04:46.200">you're not running the audio application anymore so when you think about building</p>
      <p begin="00:04:46.200" end="00:04:50.320">an audio app is important to think about this user interaction model and really</p>
      <p begin="00:04:50.320" end="00:04:56.290">designed for background audio...talk about background audio really talking about that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.290" end="00:05:01.030">experience with the users minimize their app and they're doing something else but they want to keep...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:01.030" end="00:05:06.990">your music and loving the experience you provide in the past.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.990" end="00:05:11.650">We had different stories for backhoe audio on different devices the code you had to write</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.650" end="00:05:15.680">on your pc was different from the code that you had to write for</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:17.090">phone.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:17.090" end="00:05:21.460">Wanted to make this easy converge it so we've taken the approach that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.460" end="00:05:27.400">we pioneered on windows phone we brought that to the full range of devices how</p>
      <p begin="00:05:27.400" end="00:05:32.390">this approach works it's actually a to process based approach I'll get into the reasons for that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:32.390" end="00:05:34.310">moment but the first processes</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.310" end="00:05:37.510">you'll see is this rich player app that's all</p>
      <p begin="00:05:37.510" end="00:05:42.500">the ui and everything that you users going to interact with and figure out what they want to listen to and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:42.500" end="00:05:48.720">tell you what to play the second processes a low memory background task.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.720" end="00:05:52.320">This task communicates with your player app.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:54.940">So, that you can tell it what audio file should be</p>
      <p begin="00:05:54.940" end="00:06:01.110">played and then it's responsible for actually playing those files the reason that we take this</p>
      <p begin="00:06:01.110" end="00:06:05.490">to process approach is because windows runs on this huge range of devices</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.490" end="00:06:09.860">you've heard about for really high-end desktops and high-end phones and stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.860" end="00:06:14.510">there's a lot of resources available but on a low-end phone, you know, if you think about the seventy</p>
      <p begin="00:06:14.510" end="00:06:19.510">five-dollar phone that someone's buying because they broke their phone...I want to shell out six hundred bucks</p>
      <p begin="00:06:19.510" end="00:06:24.480">or their an emerging market is low...devices don't have a lot of resources available</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24.480" end="00:06:30.510">and you want to be really careful about how those resources are utilized so by splitting out the ui</p>
      <p begin="00:06:30.510" end="00:06:35.460">code from the actual media playing code it allows us the operating system</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.460" end="00:06:40.310">to go tear down this ui when the user goes only</p>
      <p begin="00:06:40.310" end="00:06:45.000">star browsing the web we can tear down all that ui free up those resources for other</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.000" end="00:06:49.940">things and that's great for use a developer because by enabling</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.940" end="00:06:54.840">the operating system to be really efficient with these resources we get a lot of our savings so</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.840" end="00:07:00.850">that we can keep your app running as long as possible we think this provides a lot of value for both the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:00.850" end="00:07:05.250">users of your applications and use a developer in terms of keeping your app in front</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.250" end="00:07:09.790">of the user do all the communication in the playback through a background media player</p>
      <p begin="00:07:09.790" end="00:07:13.510">...this is an object the operating system provides to-you</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.510" end="00:07:16.190">...facilitates two main things.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:16.190" end="00:07:21.330">...allows you to communicate between your background task and a rich player app so</p>
      <p begin="00:07:21.330" end="00:07:26.180">that you can keep these two items and sinking working together well and...it also provides you with</p>
      <p begin="00:07:26.180" end="00:07:32.450">the media player that you use to actually play the audio content.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:32.450" end="00:07:37.300">use this player and this gives you kind of a core experience that you want for the app but there's one more</p>
      <p begin="00:07:37.300" end="00:07:41.010">piece of the puzzle and that's the system media transport controls.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:45.470">I like to think of these is the operating system level ui that</p>
      <p begin="00:07:45.470" end="00:07:49.740">the user sees so after they've gone in the browsing the web they might</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.740" end="00:07:54.580">hit a song that they listen to recently and they want to skip over...with something new if</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.580" end="00:07:58.960">they're on a keyboard if there are a desktop they might hit the next key media key</p>
      <p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:03.800">hundred keyboard and by interacting with the system media transport controls</p>
      <p begin="00:08:03.800" end="00:08:07.190">...background task and receive those events and it can know that</p>
      <p begin="00:08:07.190" end="00:08:12.140">...skip to the next track the user just change the volume so you get all of that</p>
      <p begin="00:08:12.140" end="00:08:17.050">operating system level interaction that the user is going to expect to be available for them</p>
      <p begin="00:08:17.050" end="00:08:21.700">when they go and actually run your application and use it in conjunction with</p>
      <p begin="00:08:21.700" end="00:08:26.330">other apps so you want as you start to write a</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.330" end="00:08:30.410">background audio app take a few minutes look through the...we have</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30.410" end="00:08:35.280">...msdn it does a really great job showing you how all this works together and just kind of make</p>
      <p begin="00:08:35.280" end="00:08:38.630">sure you understand the architecture that you want to build...take</p>
      <p begin="00:08:38.630" end="00:08:41.460">...few minutes up-front and getting that architecture in</p>
      <p begin="00:08:41.460" end="00:08:47.570">mine's it set you up for success so you can build...really great application down the line.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:47.570" end="00:08:51.510">It's really easy to semis messages with the background media player</p>
      <p begin="00:08:51.510" end="00:08:54.970">so in this case we just got a really basic scenario where.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:54.970" end="00:08:59.030">The users in your application ui and they've quick the next track button</p>
      <p begin="00:08:59.030" end="00:09:01.110">...want to listen to something else.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:01.110" end="00:09:05.930">Using the background media player with the send message to background method you can just send a</p>
      <p begin="00:09:05.930" end="00:09:10.610">string in this case I've chosen max but any arbitrary string that you want to send you can</p>
      <p begin="00:09:10.610" end="00:09:15.460">send from that foreground process to background process will receive that string</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.460" end="00:09:18.210">...no hey when I get the keyword maxed</p>
      <p begin="00:09:18.210" end="00:09:22.800">...and extract the...world listen to this anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:22.800" end="00:09:27.110">So, it's really simple to get these basic messages but we also know for a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:09:27.110" end="00:09:32.180">you want to build something more complex were string passing isn't sufficient so we also support</p>
      <p begin="00:09:32.180" end="00:09:37.970">sending values sets and this example...what you'll see if you go download our msdn</p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.970" end="00:09:40.720">sample since we think this is really the way a lot of you want</p>
      <p begin="00:09:40.720" end="00:09:46.040">to designer applications in the msdn sample you'll see that there's three.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:46.040" end="00:09:50.120">Projects and the via solution the first project is that rich player app</p>
      <p begin="00:09:50.120" end="00:09:50.880">ui mentioned.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:52.010" end="00:09:53.890">The second project is that low memory background</p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.890" end="00:09:57.800">...the third is a share has some shared classes between the two that</p>
      <p begin="00:09:57.800" end="00:10:02.560">are used for communication so in this case we define a message service class</p>
      <p begin="00:10:02.560" end="00:10:07.090">they can send a bunch of classes that we've defiance you've got...skip next message</p>
      <p begin="00:10:07.090" end="00:10:11.460">classes skip previous message class and a bunch of other ones...powerful</p>
      <p begin="00:10:11.460" end="00:10:16.150">with these classes you can define was data contracts and then you can use that to</p>
      <p begin="00:10:16.150" end="00:10:19.070">send rich information between the two.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.070" end="00:10:24.430">So, in this case when you send a message to the background will...value set the first item in the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:24.430" end="00:10:29.140">value set is the name of the class that we're sending and then the second item we add</p>
      <p begin="00:10:29.140" end="00:10:33.440">...value set is we serialized that...</p>
      <p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:38.430">...a stylistic choice you could say that serialized xml or any other format your choice but you</p>
      <p begin="00:10:38.430" end="00:10:42.510">...class and then you take that value set and you send that to</p>
      <p begin="00:10:42.510" end="00:10:45.410">your background task.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:45.410" end="00:10:50.110">Background task is an able to go and parcel this and get rich information perhaps you</p>
      <p begin="00:10:50.110" end="00:10:54.940">wanted to send how long the user was loosing that track so that you can take some action on matter build</p>
      <p begin="00:10:54.940" end="00:11:09.630">some analytics you do all that here so with that let's jump...quick demo and see what I'm talking about.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:09.630" end="00:11:13.040">So, I wrote that the first and foremost what I have here...just kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:11:13.040" end="00:11:18.040">...audio and you'll notice...I minimize that.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:18.040" end="00:11:24.580">Audio cuts out real simple...kind of demonstrates why background audio...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:24.580" end="00:11:29.540">In this case what I have here is I've got the windows eight one music app which is implement</p>
      <p begin="00:11:29.540" end="00:11:32.880">a background audio you'll notice now when I play.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:32.880" end="00:11:37.750">Music I can minimize the...an audio.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:37.750" end="00:11:40.730">What you...might notice that...with...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:40.730" end="00:11:46.300">tracks however is that there's...positive between each...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:46.300" end="00:11:49.950">And, the reason those audible positive exist because of windows</p>
      <p begin="00:11:49.950" end="00:11:54.880">eight one we did not have support for gap with audio this</p>
      <p begin="00:11:54.880" end="00:11:58.920">...been a top customer pinpoint...we've heard in the</p>
      <p begin="00:11:58.920" end="00:12:03.000">...developers and users...excited to announce that with windows ten</p>
      <p begin="00:12:04.300" end="00:12:10.920">we've added support for the platform a background audio.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.920" end="00:12:15.100">And, what I love about the approach that we've...we really solved to developer</p>
      <p begin="00:12:15.100" end="00:12:18.780">...points with one solution we've added support for a set</p>
      <p begin="00:12:18.780" end="00:12:23.390">of playlist api is...make it really easy for you to manage these playlist</p>
      <p begin="00:12:23.390" end="00:12:28.280">that works for both audio and video files and when you use these playlist api</p>
      <p begin="00:12:28.280" end="00:12:32.530">is you get gap with audio support for free out-of-the-box</p>
      <p begin="00:12:32.530" end="00:12:38.080">with no additional code required for you we do this in two ways?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:38.080" end="00:12:42.950">First and foremost we look at the files that you're playing windows mp threes</p>
      <p begin="00:12:42.950" end="00:12:47.920">are encoded it's possible for the encoder to write a set of meta data to those</p>
      <p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:52.870">tracks the details exactly where audio silence</p>
      <p begin="00:12:52.870" end="00:12:54.330">exists.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:54.330" end="00:12:59.190">Not stepping back moment...key source of those gaps in the playlist is that when audio</p>
      <p begin="00:12:59.190" end="00:13:04.080">encoded the encoder can write a little bit of extra white space between it so if you're ripping a</p>
      <p begin="00:13:04.080" end="00:13:05.670">cd that's a common source of</p>
      <p begin="00:13:05.670" end="00:13:10.300">that so the encoder can detail where that spaces been added and</p>
      <p begin="00:13:10.300" end="00:13:14.730">then we playback those tracks will parse that metadata and will snip out</p>
      <p begin="00:13:14.730" end="00:13:20.880">those little pieces of space so that you get that campus experience?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:25.470">At the same time we recognize that a lot of users they don't know what encoder they</p>
      <p begin="00:13:25.470" end="00:13:29.590">used when they rip their cd library they don't care they just want all of it to</p>
      <p begin="00:13:29.590" end="00:13:35.050">work and they don't understand why do these files play back gap...of these...gaps.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:35.050" end="00:13:39.760">So, to support those files that do not have that metadata present we've also added</p>
      <p begin="00:13:39.760" end="00:13:42.880">a set...to the platform so</p>
      <p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:45.490">we're playing back any other audio file we</p>
      <p begin="00:13:45.490" end="00:13:49.730">...heuristics to sniff out whereas some white space been introduced and</p>
      <p begin="00:13:49.730" end="00:13:56.230">...slice set out again so that no matter what file you're playing always gap was audio.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:56.230" end="00:14:04.110">So, I've got a code sly boats go ahead and just jump into visual studio.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:04.110" end="00:14:09.780">what I've got here is this is just the this is a modified version of the msdn sample</p>
      <p begin="00:14:09.780" end="00:14:12.200">we've got online for-you and the code that you</p>
      <p begin="00:14:12.200" end="00:14:17.180">see is the code for actually creating one of these play lists?</p>
      <p begin="00:14:17.180" end="00:14:21.360">The first thing you do is you go and create a new playback list object in this case</p>
      <p begin="00:14:21.360" end="00:14:26.060">we've enabled looping on that as well we have a list of songs</p>
      <p begin="00:14:26.060" end="00:14:28.450">...just iterate through those songs.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:28.450" end="00:14:30.090">And, for each your song</p>
      <p begin="00:14:30.090" end="00:14:34.180">...that we encounter will create a new media source.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:34.180" end="00:14:39.000">We set a couple custom properties in this case and this the track...title key</p>
      <p begin="00:14:39.000" end="00:14:43.600">this is totally optional but we think will be really nice for use developers because</p>
      <p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:48.010">...provides...for you download...to go query and see what's</p>
      <p begin="00:14:48.010" end="00:14:51.920">...that's playing you could go look up the track id entitle key to see what the users</p>
      <p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:57.980">listening to when they hit that skip next button so once you set up your source using</p>
      <p begin="00:14:57.980" end="00:15:02.900">...turn that into a media playback item and add that to your playback list.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:02.900" end="00:15:06.420">We go through we add all of our items the playback list.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:06.420" end="00:15:08.730">And, then you simply set that is your source on your</p>
      <p begin="00:15:08.730" end="00:15:18.120">background media player and you'll see that now when you have five.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:18.120" end="00:15:20.320">Sample come up and now when we listen to it</p>
      <p begin="00:15:20.320" end="00:15:28.960">we'll get a gap was experiences seamlessly switches between.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:28.960" end="00:15:33.880">you can even minimize that and everything...why'd you...the list they have no idea what</p>
      <p begin="00:15:33.880" end="00:15:38.530">...for which the contract...retract for doesn't matter</p>
      <p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:44.890">so, we think that you're going to love this is a developer because it makes your life easier writing these apps</p>
      <p begin="00:15:44.890" end="00:15:54.160">and users ago love the fact that you've got gap...audio support.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:56.100">There's one last.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:56.100" end="00:15:59.330">Thing to keep in mind when we talk about audio and that's that</p>
      <p begin="00:15:59.330" end="00:16:04.230">we talked about music a lot right now but there's a lot more audio that gets played</p>
      <p begin="00:16:04.230" end="00:16:07.860">through the platform for movies and music to communications</p>
      <p begin="00:16:07.860" end="00:16:10.550">and games there's a ton of different audio</p>
      <p begin="00:16:10.550" end="00:16:15.230">those different categories of audio have different expectations in terms of how the audio</p>
      <p begin="00:16:15.230" end="00:16:20.850">is process and used, for example, if you're single movie what the user to be able to hear the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:20.850" end="00:16:24.270">quiet whispers to the loud explosions and to do so in a</p>
      <p begin="00:16:24.270" end="00:16:27.920">way that doesn't I'm constantly fiddling with the volume control in order to get</p>
      <p begin="00:16:27.920" end="00:16:32.290">a good experience communication app on the other hand you really want to make sure that the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:32.290" end="00:16:37.670">...the vocals come through clearing...understandable so there's different filters that</p>
      <p begin="00:16:37.670" end="00:16:41.170">you want to provide for these audio.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:41.170" end="00:16:44.040">Categories so we defined a set of categories</p>
      <p begin="00:16:44.040" end="00:16:48.200">...the platform it's really easy for use a developer to set you just set it on</p>
      <p begin="00:16:48.200" end="00:16:51.730">your media element and never worry about it again and then windows</p>
      <p begin="00:16:51.730" end="00:16:56.660">...take this information and we use...communicate with the audio driver to make sure</p>
      <p begin="00:16:56.660" end="00:17:03.640">that we provide the best possible experience when you users or...to audio.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:03.640" end="00:17:06.370">So, we think all this is really great it'll make it really easy</p>
      <p begin="00:17:06.370" end="00:17:11.180">...to write one audio app that runs on all those devices when you think about these audio categories its</p>
      <p begin="00:17:11.180" end="00:17:15.070">important remember him when we talk about video as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.070" end="00:17:20.370">Video you generally going to set the movie category and playback.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:20.370" end="00:17:24.130">When you think about video today however one of the big things that you</p>
      <p begin="00:17:24.130" end="00:17:28.900">hear a lot is the term adaptive streaming adaptive streaming is how you can</p>
      <p begin="00:17:28.900" end="00:17:33.750">target that huge range of devices that will run?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:33.750" end="00:17:38.220">From the sm phone on a three-g network to your xbox with</p>
      <p begin="00:17:38.220" end="00:17:42.580">the four-k tv in a really fast internet connection it's a way to</p>
      <p begin="00:17:42.580" end="00:17:47.530">have a set of video files that provide the best experience for each</p>
      <p begin="00:17:47.530" end="00:17:52.450">user each device running on any network real quick for those</p>
      <p begin="00:17:52.450" end="00:17:58.160">you who aren't familiar with the term adapt...kind of this the term...refers to a collection</p>
      <p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:02.850">of technologies that can be used to provide that create experience on devices</p>
      <p begin="00:18:02.850" end="00:18:07.620">...a high-level how it works is you've got your video file that you actually want to play back</p>
      <p begin="00:18:07.620" end="00:18:13.760">all these devices you can then take that file and you can encoded in a bunch of different</p>
      <p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:18.590">bit rates so you can go from really low-quality to really high-quality with different bandwidth</p>
      <p begin="00:18:18.590" end="00:18:23.510">requirements for supporting each of those and then you can chop all those video files up into a bunch</p>
      <p begin="00:18:23.510" end="00:18:27.370">of segments is a to for maybe ten second chunks of video.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:28.470" end="00:18:32.490">And, then you have a manifest file is on the server you have a manifest file</p>
      <p begin="00:18:32.490" end="00:18:37.450">the describes here's all the video content that's available here's how I can access this</p>
      <p begin="00:18:37.450" end="00:18:41.990">content is you can download it and playback for the user there's a</p>
      <p begin="00:18:41.990" end="00:18:47.730">lot of solutions out there for how you can create this content, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:47.730" end="00:18:52.590">as your media services has a great set they've got a talk on...two to three so if you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:18:52.590" end="00:18:57.530">learn more about the service side of this encourage you to go to that talk regardless of</p>
      <p begin="00:18:57.530" end="00:19:02.440">if you use as your another service provider you get all your content up in the cloud.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:02.440" end="00:19:07.240">And, then on the client-side you have a streaming client...clients responsible for</p>
      <p begin="00:19:07.240" end="00:19:12.100">downloading that manifest determining what contents available play and play</p>
      <p begin="00:19:12.100" end="00:19:16.220">back the best content for that user...device...going to</p>

      <p begin="00:19:31.130" end="00:19:35.940">are downloading really fast and there's a lot of extra bandwidth will go switch to higher-quality video so</p>
      <p begin="00:19:35.940" end="00:19:40.770">the user gets better viewing experience the other hand if the</p>
      <p begin="00:19:40.770" end="00:19:43.960">...downloading slowly and there's not enough network throughput</p>
      <p begin="00:19:43.960" end="00:19:48.560">...support playing back that file without buffering it...switch down to a</p>
      <p begin="00:19:48.560" end="00:19:53.490">lower quality bit rate so that you can ensure that you avoid those painful buffers</p>
      <p begin="00:19:53.490" end="00:19:58.440">and providing great seamless viewing experience for the user so as its playback this</p>
      <p begin="00:19:58.440" end="00:19:59.520">...constantly</p>
      <p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:05.610">downloading new segments and switching between them to provide the best possible experience.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:05.610" end="00:20:08.450">Some of the common technologies that we see...use...today</p>
      <p begin="00:20:08.450" end="00:20:13.060">...which is a specification that's developed by apple and they actually require</p>
      <p begin="00:20:13.060" end="00:20:16.010">...for streaming to ios devices over cellular networks.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:17.400" end="00:20:22.330">...dash which is an iso standard that seeing really brought adoption especially</p>
      <p begin="00:20:22.330" end="00:20:25.870">in...the world such as europe and dashes it's</p>
      <p begin="00:20:25.870" end="00:20:30.900">...standard so people really like to reference and build on this solution</p>
      <p begin="00:20:30.900" end="00:20:36.450">that's interoperable and available to everyone the third one is smooth streaming which is the technology</p>
      <p begin="00:20:36.450" end="00:20:39.730">that microsoft developed and four years ago for solving</p>
      <p begin="00:20:39.730" end="00:20:43.840">the same problem with smooth streaming we actually took all</p>
      <p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:48.780">...that technology we published all the specifications release...ip</p>
      <p begin="00:20:48.780" end="00:20:54.650">related to it and it was one of the key inputs into the dashing this reform as</p>
      <p begin="00:20:54.650" end="00:20:59.400">they defined initial standard so we like think of dashes smooth streaming plus</p>

      <p begin="00:21:04.290" end="00:21:11.110">ideas that we've seen in the industry and, it's a really great solution that people are starting to roll-out today.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:11.110" end="00:21:12.190">Overall as a company</p>
      <p begin="00:21:12.190" end="00:21:16.910">however we know that there's a lot of content that exist today that's we</p>
      <p begin="00:21:16.910" end="00:21:21.430">want-to make sure please great on windows and there's a lot of content that's coming from the future</p>
      <p begin="00:21:21.430" end="00:21:26.470">...really committed to interoperable media so in the past...only had the smooth streaming</p>

      <p begin="00:21:31.670" end="00:21:38.760">got ahead we've added support in the platform for both the...in-dash protocols.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:38.760" end="00:21:46.000">Now you can see...this is awesome let's go.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:49.880">When I say we've got platform support I mean that it's as easy as with</p>
      <p begin="00:21:49.880" end="00:21:53.750">one-line of code you can get fully adaptive streaming h alas in-dash</p>
      <p begin="00:21:53.750" end="00:21:58.700">content and that's available for both applications and websites you</p>

      <p begin="00:22:09.910" end="00:22:14.460">it back is really powerful we've also gone ahead and</p>
      <p begin="00:22:14.460" end="00:22:18.780">...updating the smooth streaming sdk for windows ten so for all of you who</p>
      <p begin="00:22:18.780" end="00:22:20.990">can use that to build eight one apps</p>
      <p begin="00:22:20.990" end="00:22:25.930">this sdk will be available it's going to be online very soon?</p>
      <p begin="00:22:25.930" end="00:22:29.630">And,...make it really easy for you to go ahead and take your existing</p>

      <p begin="00:22:31.600" end="00:22:36.590">...as and not have to rewrite...your video streaming code.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:36.590" end="00:22:40.810">So, this is really powerful for...sites but we also recognize that a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:22:40.810" end="00:22:44.550">people want support for customization...to...some of</p>
      <p begin="00:22:44.550" end="00:22:49.310">the a experience without having to go rewrite or go</p>
      <p begin="00:22:49.310" end="00:22:54.110">right an entire streaming client so common use case that I've heard from developers</p>
      <p begin="00:22:54.110" end="00:22:58.530">that they want to control the initial bit rate that's downloaded and playback this</p>
      <p begin="00:22:58.530" end="00:23:02.170">...powerful because there's a lot of different user experience...a can</p>
      <p begin="00:23:02.170" end="00:23:05.310">duluth be delivered with that initial bit rate.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:05.310" end="00:23:06.280">For example,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:06.280" end="00:23:10.950">if the initial bit rates the lowest quality stream available you're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:23:10.950" end="00:23:15.730">get really, really fast time to first frame it's going to be like that and you're going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:23:15.730" end="00:23:22.120">...content for the user and then you can ramp up to high-quality stream from there.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:22.120" end="00:23:27.040">Other people prefer starting it really high-quality and they don't want to see that ramp up so they'd</p>
      <p begin="00:23:27.040" end="00:23:31.720">rather take a little extra time up-front and...that really high-quality furs frames that</p>
      <p begin="00:23:31.720" end="00:23:35.040">...video looks great from the moment you start so we've got</p>
      <p begin="00:23:35.040" end="00:23:39.470">...for this so that you can control what the initial bit rate is along with a bunch</p>
      <p begin="00:23:39.470" end="00:23:44.140">of other customizations we'll get a few we get into the code there's a lot more</p>
      <p begin="00:23:44.140" end="00:23:49.380">...msdn we think that we provided a great set of default</p>
      <p begin="00:23:49.380" end="00:23:54.220">values and provide a great default experience but we want to be a dictator for</p>
      <p begin="00:23:54.220" end="00:23:57.990">how streaming behaves on the platform so we want to provide you with that customization</p>
      <p begin="00:23:59.340" end="00:24:01.890">so that and we know that some of you want even more customization</p>
      <p begin="00:24:03.560" end="00:24:06.400">in windows aone we added support for</p>
      <p begin="00:24:06.400" end="00:24:10.630">...it's a set of wthree-c api is.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:10.630" end="00:24:15.110">...it really easy in the browser to...adaptive streaming application</p>

      <p begin="00:24:23.740" end="00:24:29.300">minutes of buffer developers have been really happy with this technology and we've seen a lot uptick we</p>
      <p begin="00:24:29.300" end="00:24:33.390">wanted to make that easy for use animal developers out there as well so we've gone ahead</p>
      <p begin="00:24:33.390" end="00:24:38.270">and we've created a winner...projection of the microsoft see api surface</p>
      <p begin="00:24:38.270" end="00:24:41.410">so that you can use that from any language of your choice.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:42.530" end="00:24:47.420">Makes a really easy removes a lot of boiler plate code that you had to write for building a streaming</p>
      <p begin="00:24:47.420" end="00:24:51.780">app so for those of you who desire that for custom solution</p>
      <p begin="00:24:51.780" end="00:24:55.070">that should be great for you works with media protection manager for</p>
      <p begin="00:24:55.070" end="00:24:59.760">dr am in xhtml csharp case and not only do</p>
      <p begin="00:24:59.760" end="00:25:04.470">...we added support for mp for which we had in the browser...one we've also</p>
      <p begin="00:25:04.470" end="00:25:08.510">...support for mpeg...transport streams which is the container used fridge</p>
      <p begin="00:25:08.510" end="00:25:12.750">...so you can go ahead and use this technology for building both custom</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.750" end="00:25:18.570">dash nhl us players as well as...so let's</p>
      <p begin="00:25:18.570" end="00:25:24.470">get some code and see just how easy it really is to add this to...application.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:24.470" end="00:25:35.090">Let's see that is another one.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:35.090" end="00:25:36.210">...cool so what I</p>
      <p begin="00:25:36.210" end="00:25:42.430">have here is I've just got a blank csharp project that I created.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:42.430" end="00:25:47.130">Demo in csharp today because it's language and I'm most comfortable...but if you prefer</p>
      <p begin="00:25:47.130" end="00:25:51.820">...cplus-plus another language works the same for you there.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:51.820" end="00:25:56.430">So, create the...projects you don't have to watch me get that open and we'll just go</p>
      <p begin="00:25:56.430" end="00:26:04.210">ahead and start by putting in some really basic ui...the application.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:04.210" end="00:26:07.970">We go ahead and build...you'll see as we just got a grid with three rows</p>
      <p begin="00:26:07.970" end="00:26:12.330">the first row has just a text box...a button where you can set whatever</p>
      <p begin="00:26:12.330" end="00:26:16.990">manifest you want to play the application we're going to build today by the way supports</p>

      <p begin="00:26:20.120" end="00:26:25.110">their zero api differences between the two streaming technologies so makes a really</p>
      <p begin="00:26:25.110" end="00:26:27.490">...if...considering a move,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:27.490" end="00:26:32.010">for example, from a...us the dash is a great way to support your existing library</p>
      <p begin="00:26:32.010" end="00:26:36.260">and your new content is a comes online so</p>
      <p begin="00:26:36.260" end="00:26:40.910">...the text box takes in a manifest the play button...transport controls and just the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:40.910" end="00:26:45.570">con thecopyright attribution at the bottom but obviously when I quick play nothing</p>
      <p begin="00:26:45.570" end="00:26:53.110">happens we need to actually go and wire up support for adaptive streaming.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:53.110" end="00:26:59.170">So, how you can do that is first off we need to add support we need to add?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:59.170" end="00:27:02.240">Quick method handler so you can add the event and then using</p>
      <p begin="00:27:02.240" end="00:27:08.660">...twelve it's really easy to just pop over into cs file...support.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:08.660" end="00:27:13.530">what we do is with the first-line...code we go ahead and we grab the</p>
      <p begin="00:27:13.530" end="00:27:16.260">...that's from that text box we convert it</p>
      <p begin="00:27:16.260" end="00:27:20.270">to system uri and then we'll set that as the source on the</p>
      <p begin="00:27:20.270" end="00:27:24.560">media element and that's it go ahead and run that project</p>
      <p begin="00:27:24.560" end="00:27:27.950">...start streaming back in this case I believe I have an ageless</p>
      <p begin="00:27:27.950" end="00:27:32.670">...them there when you could play quite...your</p>
      <p begin="00:27:32.670" end="00:27:37.190">...by my robot hand moi?</p>
      <p begin="00:27:37.190" end="00:27:38.670">So, this is awesome and,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:38.670" end="00:27:44.010">you know, two minutes you've got ahead you built-in application that's capable of playing both</p>
      <p begin="00:27:44.010" end="00:27:48.730">...and dash content...fully adaptive makes a really easy</p>
      <p begin="00:27:48.730" end="00:27:54.210">for you but I know you sitting there and say well that's great but,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:54.210" end="00:27:58.620">you know, I've seen a lot in the news about close captions and I've heard from</p>
      <p begin="00:27:58.620" end="00:28:01.150">lawyers that I have to support close captions if</p>
      <p begin="00:28:01.150" end="00:28:06.740">I'm in america and it's also just really important that I support on my users.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:06.740" end="00:28:11.160">In the past for close captions we've seen a lot of people views the player framework</p>
      <p begin="00:28:11.160" end="00:28:15.740">sdk that's open-source online for adding those closed caption experiences</p>
      <p begin="00:28:15.740" end="00:28:20.110">steer app it's hard it's not code than anybody wants to write so</p>
      <p begin="00:28:20.110" end="00:28:25.070">we've gone ahead with windows...and added native support for</p>
      <p begin="00:28:25.070" end="00:28:29.020">close captions to the platform supports all the top formats</p>
      <p begin="00:28:29.020" end="00:28:33.460">and delivery mechanisms today...have six to eight or six and seven</p>
      <p begin="00:28:33.460" end="00:28:37.100">...captions in your si header you can use to html you can use web</p>
      <p begin="00:28:37.100" end="00:28:40.910">...bunch of other caption formats whichever one</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.910" end="00:28:43.560">...using we support that we've got a place</p>
      <p begin="00:28:43.560" end="00:28:47.750">...the os where the user can customize it this is really powerful think about</p>
      <p begin="00:28:47.750" end="00:28:53.060">...you can in the case of using...in-band close captions,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:53.060" end="00:28:58.310">for example,...lines of code you meet all of your fcc requirements and</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58.310" end="00:29:02.680">...have a great experience if you want to add support for</p>
      <p begin="00:29:02.680" end="00:29:05.170">adam band there's a few lines of code that you need to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:05.170" end="00:29:09.050">...so the first thing you need to do you need to initialize</p>
      <p begin="00:29:09.050" end="00:29:13.250">...media source adapted media source is</p>
      <p begin="00:29:13.250" end="00:29:17.550">the underlying source that was created when we set that manifest on the media element</p>
      <p begin="00:29:19.640" end="00:29:24.550">so by default will go ahead and wire that up and creative for you but if you want use close captions</p>
      <p begin="00:29:24.550" end="00:29:28.670">...some of those customization api as I mentioned you need to add some you need to add this and</p>
      <p begin="00:29:28.670" end="00:29:32.060">here app so the first thing we'll do is.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:32.060" end="00:29:39.420">We'll go ahead...add that and now rather than setting the...we call this method that we've created.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:39.420" end="00:29:40.260">...just pass in the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:40.260" end="00:29:44.940">manifestly want to play the url to it as well as the media element that we want</p>
      <p begin="00:29:46.250" end="00:29:51.240">in here what we do is we create an adaptive media source creation objects that.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:51.240" end="00:29:53.810">Object tells us were successful in creating at</p>
      <p begin="00:29:53.810" end="00:29:58.380">...provide a bunch error information if we were able to create either due to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.380" end="00:30:01.660">...uri or network conditions are many other errors.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:02.930" end="00:30:08.350">then once it's created we can go ahead and grab that media source I'm going to quickly.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:08.350" end="00:30:13.150">...the top of the class and just going to find this object to.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:13.150" end="00:30:18.470">Make a really easy for us to work with all...through this project.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:18.470" end="00:30:24.640">So, we've got our adaptive media source object and now we need to go ahead and add closed caption support</p>
      <p begin="00:30:24.640" end="00:30:28.430">...building real application you're probably going to have your closed caption file</p>
      <p begin="00:30:28.430" end="00:30:32.940">posted online somewhere that you downloading but for the sake of this demo I'm just going</p>
      <p begin="00:30:32.940" end="00:30:40.840">to grab html file that I added earlier today.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:40.840" end="00:30:45.630">So, you can take a look this is just standard html.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:45.630" end="00:30:47.770">We're going-to go ahead and tag this is contents so</p>
      <p begin="00:30:47.770" end="00:30:52.990">the visual studiopick setup properly for the build process.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:52.990" end="00:30:57.010">And, then we're going to do is we're going-to go ahead.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:57.010" end="00:31:01.190">Tags html file...closed caption track.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:01.190" end="00:31:02.780">An added term media source.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:03.800" end="00:31:08.350">So, the first thing we do is we go and we create a media source objects former</p>
      <p begin="00:31:08.350" end="00:31:09.580">...media source.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:10.780" end="00:31:13.410">Next we're going to get grab the url to that</p>
      <p begin="00:31:13.410" end="00:31:17.520">...file and we'll use...create a...source.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:17.520" end="00:31:22.470">And, with that timedtext source we can then add it to are media source so now we've</p>
      <p begin="00:31:22.470" end="00:31:26.430">...the adaptive streaming media source</p>
      <p begin="00:31:26.430" end="00:31:30.280">with the tty html source...we can play those back and sank.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:31.290" end="00:31:36.120">Once you've got your source created you can then create a media playback item</p>
      <p begin="00:31:36.120" end="00:31:40.950">and set that item on your media player and now we run the application</p>
      <p begin="00:31:40.950" end="00:31:47.560">will see not only do we have a fully adaptive app but it supports close captions as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:47.560" end="00:31:54.240">We go ahead...good...freaked out by my robot and you'll notice moi.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:54.240" end="00:31:56.830">We've got a closed caption button that's now been automatically added</p>
      <p begin="00:31:56.830" end="00:32:00.740">to the media controls windows is picked up the close captions</p>
      <p begin="00:32:00.740" end="00:32:05.060">our presence in the file we put that button there and you can turn it on</p>
      <p begin="00:32:05.060" end="00:32:08.560">...with our moi.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:13.020" end="00:32:14.620">As we although it's not just sufficient</p>
      <p begin="00:32:14.620" end="00:32:19.570">have captions they need to be user customizable and to do that you can go ahead and go</p>
      <p begin="00:32:19.570" end="00:32:23.810">into the settings application and ease of access you'll notice we've</p>
      <p begin="00:32:23.810" end="00:32:28.100">added closed caption tab if you go there there's a ton of different</p>
      <p begin="00:32:28.100" end="00:32:32.960">customizations user can set they can specify their font the background et cetera</p>
      <p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:38.120">so perhaps we'll say for this example I really like my captions and read I think the makes</p>
      <p begin="00:32:38.120" end="00:32:42.510">of lot easier for me to read as I can go ahead and set that up what I</p>
      <p begin="00:32:42.510" end="00:32:43.860">could play</p>
      <p begin="00:32:49.660" end="00:32:54.550">this is really, really powerful and it's great for users as well because they can just go</p>
      <p begin="00:32:54.550" end="00:32:58.860">set up their preferences one-time and then it works across all of their video</p>
      <p begin="00:32:58.860" end="00:33:03.810">applications you don't have to write any code users get the experience they</p>
      <p begin="00:33:03.810" end="00:33:10.140">expect...this is a huge win for the platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:10.140" end="00:33:14.940">If you do want to write your own render I will mention that all of the q objects that</p>
      <p begin="00:33:14.940" end="00:33:19.140">we were setting there they're all available to so you can go pick up all those caption</p>
      <p begin="00:33:19.140" end="00:33:22.240">...and do whatever you want them?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:22.240" end="00:33:27.000">So, this is really powerful but we know that with player framework there's another key</p>
      <p begin="00:33:27.000" end="00:33:31.470">scenario was used for allows for customizing the controls.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:31.470" end="00:33:35.850">With in the past the media controls were not easy to customize so you couldn't make</p>
      <p begin="00:33:35.850" end="00:33:40.740">them fit in with the look and feel of your application we've got ahead and we've added supports</p>
      <p begin="00:33:40.740" end="00:33:44.720">the platform for customizable media controls as well so it's really,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:44.720" end="00:33:49.690">really easy for you to take your app and make it look great with the ui that</p>
      <p begin="00:33:49.690" end="00:33:54.660">you've built so, for example, let's say we want to add a little color</p>
      <p begin="00:33:54.660" end="00:33:59.560">...I know my boss she absolutely loves orange is</p>
      <p begin="00:33:59.560" end="00:34:02.460">your favorite color she's always telling me that oranges</p>
      <p begin="00:34:02.460" end="00:34:09.060">the new black so I want to add a little origin there for her.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:09.060" end="00:34:10.940">What you can do?</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.940" end="00:34:14.620">You can just add a resource dictionary to your app dot example</p>
      <p begin="00:34:14.620" end="00:34:20.710">file is to keep brushes that you want to update the first is a system control highlight accent</p>
      <p begin="00:34:20.710" end="00:34:23.960">And, the other is the system control foreground...brush.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:23.960" end="00:34:28.770">...these both the orange and now when I run the application you'll see that we've added a splash</p>
      <p begin="00:34:28.770" end="00:34:33.660">orange to the app so it starts to look better I know my boss is going to love having that</p>
      <p begin="00:34:33.660" end="00:34:39.290">support...freaked out by my robot hand moi so</p>
      <p begin="00:34:39.290" end="00:34:44.090">it super easy and we think the this will go a long way towards making the</p>
      <p begin="00:34:44.090" end="00:34:50.149">ui fit in better with your app at the same time however we know that a lot of you want to do even more</p>
      <p begin="00:34:50.149" end="00:34:51.679">advance things.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:51.679" end="00:34:54.789">You want to update you want to add new buttons you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:34:54.789" end="00:34:58.569">disable buttons you want to change the dropout order</p>
      <p begin="00:34:58.569" end="00:35:01.999">when I say dropout order what I mean is that on a ten foot...</p>
      <p begin="00:35:01.999" end="00:35:06.289">...xbox experience you could fit a lot more buttons on the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:06.289" end="00:35:09.639">timeline when you're on a three inch phone so we've got</p>
      <p begin="00:35:09.639" end="00:35:12.849">away free to do all of this and more.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:12.849" end="00:35:16.139">And, how that works you can just go ahead and grab the generic</p>

      <p begin="00:37:14.900" end="00:37:19.760">that don't really give you any value you can minimize that ignore it never worry about it again</p>
      <p begin="00:37:20.900" end="00:37:23.880">then you can come down and you'll find.</p>

      <p begin="00:37:33.450" end="00:37:39.560">there's a couple key properties to note here the first one is the dropout or</p>
      <p begin="00:37:39.560" end="00:37:43.770">dropout order specifies as your application scales from large</p>

      <p begin="00:37:48.760" end="00:37:53.760">on the ui so in this case the stop button we have that by default set to</p>

      <p begin="00:37:54.410" end="00:37:59.230">of one which means that if you can't fit every single button on the screen it's going to be the first button</p>

      <p begin="00:38:26.820" end="00:38:30.420">And, there's a couple keep buttons one of them is the closed caption</p>
      <p begin="00:38:30.420" end="00:38:34.990">button we talked about earlier this is said to collapse by default</p>
      <p begin="00:38:34.990" end="00:38:39.590">...handle turning that on and off for you because captions or such</p>
      <p begin="00:38:39.590" end="00:38:44.470">an important part of the user experience we automatically turn that button on</p>
      <p begin="00:38:44.470" end="00:38:49.330">...their present so...users always in control and you don't have to worry about when captions</p>
      <p begin="00:38:49.330" end="00:38:56.520">are present or not the other button that will do the same thing for you is with the audio</p>
      <p begin="00:38:56.520" end="00:39:01.360">track selection button...multiple audio tracks in the file you're playing whether it's either and</p>

      <p begin="00:39:12.250" end="00:39:16.050">So, we've got a great set of buttons for you but.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:16.050" end="00:39:20.960">As we mentioned earlier there's a lot of strong opinions around how streaming</p>
      <p begin="00:39:20.960" end="00:39:25.880">should behave and if you want high-quality or to start low-quality and stuff I personally</p>
      <p begin="00:39:25.880" end="00:39:30.630">I really like seeing my videos and high-quality all the time and I want to add a high</p>
      <p begin="00:39:30.630" end="00:39:34.450">...button the application the one collects just locks</p>
      <p begin="00:39:34.450" end="00:39:39.430">onto the highest quality bit rate and streams at that I'm willing to risk some buffering</p>
      <p begin="00:39:39.430" end="00:39:42.740">...a lower quality experience in that sense that I get that real...</p>
      <p begin="00:39:42.740" end="00:39:49.890">video experience so this is really easy with our new controls to go ahead and add that button.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:49.890" end="00:39:52.540">We just create a quick buttoned I've...the dropout</p>
      <p begin="00:39:52.540" end="00:39:57.530">order to eleven because this is really important in my opinion for the quality experience for the app that</p>
      <p begin="00:39:57.530" end="00:40:01.780">we're building today have gone ahead and I've made that visible.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:01.780" end="00:40:05.900">You can see that I've just gone ahead and we'll just show up is hq.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:05.900" end="00:40:08.680">On the playback timeline.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:08.680" end="00:40:09.720">So, once you've gone ahead and</p>
      <p begin="00:40:09.720" end="00:40:14.320">you've added this you want to make sure by the way that you update.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:14.320" end="00:40:17.200">Your target type here's what's reference</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.200" end="00:40:21.650">...by your app so-called...custom media transport controls.</p>

      <p begin="00:40:31.260" end="00:40:34.570">So, we references transport controls you'll see</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.570" end="00:40:39.320">...also turning on a couple buttons of turned on the playback rate button and the zoom</p>
      <p begin="00:40:39.320" end="00:40:43.500">enabled button think those are important the user experience and I really like</p>
      <p begin="00:40:43.500" end="00:40:48.190">the playback rate button because sometimes I have to watch training videos...I want to be able to turn that on</p>
      <p begin="00:40:48.190" end="00:40:51.600">to a faster speeding get the quicker.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:51.600" end="00:40:54.320">What...added...is one more piece?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:54.320" end="00:40:57.330">We need to do and that's we need to go ahead and add a new class</p>
      <p begin="00:40:57.330" end="00:41:05.650">...are custom controls the cs file.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:05.650" end="00:41:13.570">Within this class will go ahead and wire up or buttons.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:13.570" end="00:41:17.040">So, we create a new instance...the media transport controls</p>

      <p begin="00:41:20.670" end="00:41:22.020">Just supply.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:22.020" end="00:41:24.850">Template so now when you have five we'll see that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:24.850" end="00:41:30.810">...are high-quality button to the application.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:30.810" end="00:41:35.570">...is awesome but, you know, doesn't do anything there's no way</p>
      <p begin="00:41:35.570" end="00:41:42.870">we have an added support for actually locking onto that bit rate let's go ahead and do that now?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:42.870" end="00:41:46.260">The first thing that we need to do is we're going to go...a new event.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:47.280" end="00:41:52.190">That handles when that high-quality buttons clicked.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:52.190" end="00:41:53.990">And,...were also going to have a button that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:53.990" end="00:42:05.790">tracks visual...because we want to highlight that button when it's on into...when it's awesome.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:05.790" end="00:42:08.850">So, now what you'll see is when.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:08.850" end="00:42:11.390">That buttons clicked.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:11.390" end="00:42:15.780">Assuming you first we check to make sure...applications actually registered for that</p>
      <p begin="00:42:15.780" end="00:42:20.780">about if it has we go ahead...fire the event and then we update the ui so</p>
      <p begin="00:42:20.780" end="00:42:24.680">we're just updating the foreground property on that hq text</p>
      <p begin="00:42:24.680" end="00:42:28.920">...that we had...setting it's orange so fits and look or fuel looking</p>
      <p begin="00:42:28.920" end="00:42:34.960">...our app when it's enabled all tagger back to white when it's disabled.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:34.960" end="00:42:45.990">Next we'll go back to our application will handle that event.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:45.990" end="00:42:50.170">...that buttons clicked we're also going to quickly.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:50.170" end="00:42:53.470">At a reference to variable that we use for tracking the state.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:53.470" end="00:42:59.740">Within this as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:59.740" end="00:43:05.270">We'll have this disabled by default so we get adaptive streaming.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:05.270" end="00:43:10.520">Now when the buttons...</p>
      <p begin="00:43:10.520" end="00:43:14.200">We're going to use a couple new properties if you look at the adaptive media source you'll see</p>
      <p begin="00:43:14.200" end="00:43:18.480">we've got a ton of different properties download bit rate playback bit rate a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:43:18.480" end="00:43:24.100">of events for-you it's all msdn I encourage you to check it out there and play around with it</p>
      <p begin="00:43:24.100" end="00:43:29.080">in this case is to two things that we need we need to be able to set the minimum bit</p>
      <p begin="00:43:29.080" end="00:43:34.990">rate so we can sept this so that are streaming our will never go below that bit rate</p>
      <p begin="00:43:34.990" end="00:43:38.940">and...want to set that to the highest quality bit rate that's available so we can use</p>
      <p begin="00:43:38.940" end="00:43:43.290">...available bit rates property the gives us the list sordid from low</p>
      <p begin="00:43:43.290" end="00:43:48.250">to high of all the bit rates available by setting the minimum bit rate that we stream</p>
      <p begin="00:43:48.250" end="00:43:51.250">width to the highest quality bit rate available</p>
      <p begin="00:43:51.250" end="00:43:55.970">...effectively locking on to that high-quality bit rate.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:55.970" end="00:44:02.100">We'll go ahead and track that...enabled the buttons clicked again we can go ahead and set that to</p>
      <p begin="00:44:02.100" end="00:44:06.270">You can...amac spit rate it's not a surface that...you said it's a null and that'll</p>
      <p begin="00:44:06.270" end="00:44:10.900">...so that you can switch back to streaming adaptive.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:10.900" end="00:44:19.170">The last thing we need to do is we need to actually register for the events of this codes called what's correct.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:19.170" end="00:44:23.710">So, we simply handle out event and now when I...five.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:23.710" end="00:44:31.220">Will be able to actually play the application lock onto a...bit rate?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:31.220" end="00:44:33.970">Why don't you...that your freaked out by my</p>
      <p begin="00:44:33.970" end="00:44:35.370">...can see moi?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:38.820" end="00:44:42.350">...really fast internet...so it's not necessary easy to see that</p>
      <p begin="00:44:42.350" end="00:44:47.370">were locking on we've got that rates show you the download and play back so I encourage you to</p>
      <p begin="00:44:47.370" end="00:44:50.720">...take this code later improve it out and you'll see that we</p>
      <p begin="00:44:50.720" end="00:44:55.700">switch to that bit rate so once that buttons collect all future segment downloads will be at the highest</p>
      <p begin="00:44:55.700" end="00:45:01.460">quality bit rate and you can go ahead and turn that button off as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:01.460" end="00:45:04.950">So, this is all super powerful but kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:45:04.950" end="00:45:09.400">...getting a lot of controls on our main playback timeline it's getting crowded and</p>
      <p begin="00:45:09.400" end="00:45:14.370">sone highlight some of my some of the best controls to keep the...clean and simple for the user</p>
      <p begin="00:45:15.560" end="00:45:22.730">...do that you can go back to the generic does animal file we created with our custom controls.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:22.730" end="00:45:26.710">And, then down here you'll notice we've added within our command bar these are all</p>
      <p begin="00:45:26.710" end="00:45:34.320">primary commands you can also add a set of secondary commands.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:34.320" end="00:45:38.470">And, these are all commands...show up and overflow menu that when this is created</p>
      <p begin="00:45:38.470" end="00:45:42.580">we'll see in a second...in our case I think the playback rate button</p>
      <p begin="00:45:42.580" end="00:45:47.350">in the zoom buttons that we turned on...a really important to the overall experience and</p>
      <p begin="00:45:47.350" end="00:45:51.980">its important functionality but it's kind of an each audience so we want put that...</p>
      <p begin="00:45:51.980" end="00:45:57.530">overflow menu so it's available just for the people who want to see that you can go ahead and you can do it all this code all</p>
      <p begin="00:45:57.530" end="00:46:04.040">you need for the overflow menu is settle label called this one playback rate.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:04.040" end="00:46:20.900">And, then for resume will go ahead and call that zero.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:20.900" end="00:46:24.910">So, now we move the buttons here you'll see will run the application they no longer show up on that</p>
      <p begin="00:46:24.910" end="00:46:28.940">main timeline and now we've got this...</p>
      <p begin="00:46:28.940" end="00:46:33.860">...when you click this you can see we've got the playback...playback...for example, gives you a bunch of...</p>
      <p begin="00:46:33.860" end="00:46:38.870">default options but again you can customize all of this to meet your needs.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:38.870" end="00:46:41.920">So, this provides a really nice clean experiencing keep the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:41.920" end="00:46:47.870">controls fitting in with the look and feel that you one of your application.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:47.870" end="00:46:52.550">We're really excited about this functionality we think you're going to lovett the last fifteen twenty</p>
      <p begin="00:46:52.550" end="00:46:57.300">minutes we've been able to build an application that fully supports hl</p>
      <p begin="00:46:57.300" end="00:47:01.530">...and dash streaming we've got custom controls that we've</p>
      <p begin="00:47:01.530" end="00:47:03.310">...to look great in</p>
      <p begin="00:47:03.310" end="00:47:07.830">our application including custom buttons for functionality that's important to</p>
      <p begin="00:47:07.830" end="00:47:12.540">our application and we've done it all with full support for user customizable</p>
      <p begin="00:47:12.540" end="00:47:16.440">close captions this is awesome this is going to relieve a ton of</p>
      <p begin="00:47:16.440" end="00:47:26.390">...so we've heard from you guys and really make you happy.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:26.390" end="00:47:28.520">So, I'll skip over these slides I've got</p>
