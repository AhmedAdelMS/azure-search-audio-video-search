      <p begin="00:00:06.470" end="00:00:10.540">We'll get started welcome to the final session</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.540" end="00:00:14.390">file time slots off the conference we hope you've had a great</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.390" end="00:00:19.140">conference so far and we'll try to finish often a good note</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.140" end="00:00:24.140">...super encouraged by how many of you are here we found out we got the last time slot</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.140" end="00:00:27.910">...the conference who are like hmm's will anybody be here.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.910" end="00:00:32.940">So, thank you for coming here and just as a quick level set</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.940" end="00:00:36.420">how many of your writing code today against address storage?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.540" end="00:00:41.650">Ok, many of your awesome so we're going to do a sort</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.650" end="00:00:45.870">of a three-part talk here we're going to do a quick overview of our storage</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.870" end="00:00:50.280">and all its capabilities show you a bunch of code show you how to get started where</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.280" end="00:00:54.070">they're going to talk about storage from the dev ops perspective and how you keep</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.070" end="00:00:59.060">your service running and then we'll end with design patterns both existing</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.060" end="00:01:03.890">wants a new design patterns that we've added since the last time loosens</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.890" end="00:01:07.560">...conferences so let's first get started with</p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.560" end="00:01:10.910">the short video as people come in?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.910" end="00:01:15.490">Of course the session feedback please don't forget that will leave this up at the end of</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.490" end="00:01:19.950">the talkwe really appreciate your feedback and comments especially so</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.950" end="00:01:25.320">do let us know that's how we improve.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.320" end="00:01:28.870">Media start this off.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:28.870" end="00:01:33.580">The xbox live service...of the social experiences on the xbox consul things like competing with other</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.580" end="00:01:36.570">players...other players insane game...the cooperative</p>
      <p begin="00:01:36.570" end="00:01:40.490">...your competitively and also tracking the progress we hope that by</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.490" end="00:01:45.430">providing social features ortiz challenges features...things that kind of go</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.430" end="00:01:50.010">beyond game play that we're able to give you a much better more enjoyable experience</p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.010" end="00:01:54.240">...a platform or services...asher tables for their base layer of</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:01:58.590">...out where storage capsule so at the end of the day you use natural...account for</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:03.460">...table storage...use many of those free...do that because we want to go to get more</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.460" end="00:02:08.400">about elastic capacity of asher and also because we don't want to...data one place for things like</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.400" end="00:02:14.040">disaster recovery purposes so every service and xbox...a common platform base measure</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.040" end="00:02:18.470">tables to figure out where each...status xbox we</p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.470" end="00:02:22.140">...a new feature millions of people use that feature almost instantaneously</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.140" end="00:02:26.230">that's a significant amount of load...spent the last ten or twelve years trying to figure out how to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.230" end="00:02:30.050">handle scale for a removed asher storage were concerned that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:30.050" end="00:02:35.110">you could this partner service to the same thing that we're already doing a term and it was fantastic that could</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.110" end="00:02:38.640">...that we've never seen an issue where we deployed in</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:42.200">...feature and asher with the bottleneck that caused us to not have that feature</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.200" end="00:02:47.540">work as we looked future we were able to get things done faster and try things out more and you're going to make mistakes</p>
      <p begin="00:02:47.540" end="00:02:52.300">...do...great stuff...we can iterate on these things the faster and more likely</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.300" end="00:02:55.330">the automaker customers happy we want xbox</p>
      <p begin="00:02:55.330" end="00:02:58.610">always got the best place to play games and that doesn't just</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.610" end="00:03:03.440">mean that we have the best games but also those games are more fun...the more and more data</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:08.340">that can push the system in...more data we can retain and...process the user is</p>
      <p begin="00:03:08.340" end="00:03:14.050">...with experience and that's always...have to think about how many more service...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:14.050" end="00:03:18.960">do this or homework's hard...to have to provide store all this stuff we can just know...that</p>
      <p begin="00:03:18.960" end="00:03:29.280">almost infinite capacity will be there we can build almost anything imagines...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:34.150">this is the story of how one of our earliest partners when xbox</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.150" end="00:03:38.720">was building xbox one they decided to bed their business on as your as</p>
      <p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.910">your storage and now pretty much anything you do with your</p>
      <p begin="00:03:42.910" end="00:03:47.790">xbox runs through asher they run hundreds of thousands of cores</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47.790" end="00:03:52.680">run petabytes of data through our system and it's fair to say you can't really</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52.680" end="00:03:57.590">turn on your xbox without touching many parts of asher and this is</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.590" end="00:04:01.050">true across the xbox set of services</p>
      <p begin="00:04:01.050" end="00:04:03.910">...xbox live and your social</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.910" end="00:04:08.330">graph your friends your achievements activities you've taken all of that ends up</p>
      <p begin="00:04:08.330" end="00:04:12.970">in table storage of game dvr you record game clips that comes in the blob</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.970" end="00:04:14.770">...encoded the as</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14.770" end="00:04:18.800">your media services xbox make music and video the master</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.800" end="00:04:23.580">catalogues encodings everything is stored and...blob storage so this is kind of just</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.580" end="00:04:26.900">as a short set of the features that run on</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.900" end="00:04:31.440">...your storage blobs and tables so... in this is kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:36.390">our journey and figuring out how to help our partner</p>
      <p begin="00:04:36.390" end="00:04:41.160">and internal microsoft teams run first and bestmark platform so we can get</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.160" end="00:04:46.060">that scale and then bring that to our partners are, you know, developers all of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:46.060" end="00:04:51.030">...and we'll talk about this... talk through how asher storage can really get you</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.030" end="00:04:56.760">there so the first thing to start with is are infrastructure scale</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.760" end="00:05:01.650">...well over a million...today we're ninety...more than both eight of us</p>
      <p begin="00:05:01.650" end="00:05:06.580">...google combined you know, india errors are newest announce region and we have</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.580" end="00:05:11.340">in many other regions as well casual storage is an every single one of these</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.340" end="00:05:16.320">regions it's a foundational building-block along with computer networking and every</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.320" end="00:05:22.420">other as your service...many microsoft services build on top of it in terms of our own scale for</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.420" end="00:05:26.320">the stored system we have well over fifty trillion objects</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:31.180">in our system we do six million transactions per second average</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31.180" end="00:05:34.080">on our system across the world and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:38.910">if that's a hard number to rap, you know, your minor around it's basically</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.910" end="00:05:43.840">a billion transactions every three minutes that's happening all</p>
      <p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:48.750">the time in the two or three minutes you heard that video and got this slide we've done a billion transactions</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.750" end="00:05:53.400">in our system we're also enough really focused on</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.400" end="00:05:57.380">being the most open platform for getting</p>
      <p begin="00:05:57.380" end="00:06:00.750">your data regardless of what device or architecture</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.750" end="00:06:05.870">you're coming from we have rest api of course but we've also build client libraries</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.870" end="00:06:09.230">...dot net as you'd...java cplus-plus</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.230" end="00:06:12.890">...js android we just launches</p>
      <p begin="00:06:12.890" end="00:06:18.050">...the library preview or working on...library and we have python ruby and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.050" end="00:06:22.000">peach tree as well so our goal is really to abstract all of the, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:22.000" end="00:06:25.150">it's not fun to go build of rest transaction so we want</p>
      <p begin="00:06:25.150" end="00:06:30.020">to go do that give you a good standard offering that you can then depend on regardless of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:30.020" end="00:06:36.200">what platform a device your building on we're also really good at doing so</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.200" end="00:06:41.150">that hybrid storage between on from enterprises and...cloud?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.150" end="00:06:46.370">The...and disaster recovery services as your site recovery run on top of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:46.370" end="00:06:50.340">allergist storage you can have a really nice connection between all your on</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.340" end="00:06:55.230">cram machines and vietnam's do backups to disaster recovery restores into the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:55.230" end="00:06:59.370">cloud we also have store simple and offering that allows you to build enterprise</p>
      <p begin="00:06:59.370" end="00:07:04.100">tiered storage that done gets sent very efficiently and stored in the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:04.100" end="00:07:09.260">...storage cloud we have a number of different data offerings</p>
      <p begin="00:07:09.260" end="00:07:10.950">...number of different abstractions ranging</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.950" end="00:07:15.610">for unstructured storage to know sequel reliable queuing and persistent</p>
      <p begin="00:07:15.610" end="00:07:18.980">...what kind of walk through each of these...give you</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.980" end="00:07:25.150">a quick overview and how to code against them or how to use them so let's start with the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:25.150" end="00:07:30.110">base layer blobs so blobs and for each of these and abstractions I sort of have the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:30.110" end="00:07:33.660">...summary can walk away within the case blob</p>
      <p begin="00:07:33.660" end="00:07:37.510">it's highly scalable rest spaced object cloud objects</p>
      <p begin="00:07:37.510" end="00:07:41.530">...right it's where you store files what would you</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.530" end="00:07:46.350">canonical think of storing and storage you would stored and blobs...two kinds of</p>
      <p begin="00:07:46.350" end="00:07:50.970">...blog flops they're meant for sequential reads states where</p>
      <p begin="00:07:50.970" end="00:07:55.230">you'd upload files download files...typically what you would be using</p>
      <p begin="00:07:55.230" end="00:08:00.190">...page blobs which are optimized for their sparse files are optimized for random</p>
      <p begin="00:08:00.190" end="00:08:04.660">access and they actually form the backbone of as your...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:04.660" end="00:08:10.190">a service...discs so let's start by kind of jumping right into code</p>
      <p begin="00:08:10.190" end="00:08:17.530">and seeing hey how do I get started working with blobs, you know, we'll go over here?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:17.530" end="00:08:24.340">...with visual studio and open up a new project.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:24.340" end="00:08:26.480">The first thing you notice once installed the...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.480" end="00:08:31.230">dk is you have this cloud and quick starts in here.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:31.230" end="00:08:36.500">Data services...quick start samples for blob storage tables and</p>
      <p begin="00:08:36.500" end="00:08:45.760">will quickly run through those let's say I'm going to go and start this up getting a new project going.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:45.760" end="00:08:55.210">So, I'm going to open up the program.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:55.210" end="00:09:00.710">All right so right away I'm just going to start.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:00.710" end="00:09:04.370">First thing that's going to do it's going to go get the new get package references</p>
      <p begin="00:09:04.370" end="00:09:08.830">written restore them and we're up and running.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.830" end="00:09:13.350">So, we're doing some blob operations we'll talk about what containers are block mobs are</p>
      <p begin="00:09:13.350" end="00:09:15.810">...kind of doing block blobs and page blobs</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.810" end="00:09:20.550">and the sample kinda gets you up and running right away this isn't running right now against</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.570" end="00:09:27.840">...against the cloud if you notice it says.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:27.840" end="00:09:30.290">You know,...store account one this is</p>
      <p begin="00:09:30.290" end="00:09:35.220">a storage emulator running on your box so you can get started and...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:35.220" end="00:09:40.400">your tasks run all your experiments without actually...the cloud and paying for transactions and all of that</p>
      <p begin="00:09:40.400" end="00:09:48.560">so you can get started right away even offline right now in this room with no problems at all.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:53.080">So, let's cut start kind of modifying this and looking at what we can do here.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.080" end="00:09:57.220">Right now this is a pretty straightforward simple sample look at what it</p>
      <p begin="00:09:57.220" end="00:10:01.640">does and then start modifying a little bit so here's my main I have some</p>
      <p begin="00:10:01.640" end="00:10:06.570">block mob operations I have some page blob operations so let's jump in to the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:06.570" end="00:10:09.270">...operations I have a</p>
      <p begin="00:10:09.270" end="00:10:19.210">of object I'm working with here let me go ahead and exit here.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.210" end="00:10:21.500">So, the first thing I'm going to look at is, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:21.500" end="00:10:26.250">what's in here I have an image them working with...upload also then have</p>
      <p begin="00:10:26.250" end="00:10:30.870">a object hierarchy starting with a cloud storage account?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:30.870" end="00:10:35.020">And, that's something that goes in and reads a connection string from app</p>
      <p begin="00:10:35.020" end="00:10:35.520">conflict.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:36.610" end="00:10:38.540">Will go take a look at that?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:38.540" end="00:10:43.930">We then have a blob client that we create on the storage account we have a</p>
      <p begin="00:10:43.930" end="00:10:48.270">container that we create on the blob client right?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:48.270" end="00:10:52.480">And, all of these so far offline operations this is the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:57.420">first operation that actually tries to connected emulator or to a storage account in the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:57.420" end="00:10:58.500">cloud.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:58.500" end="00:11:01.280">...couple of things to notice all the code in the</p>
      <p begin="00:11:01.280" end="00:11:05.830">samples is asic we have a...and...api for all are api</p>
      <p begin="00:11:05.830" end="00:11:09.170">...we strongly recommend of course that you use a sinking api</p>
      <p begin="00:11:09.170" end="00:11:12.060">is and.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:12.060" end="00:11:15.520">You know, this is kind of a way to look at this so let's...on</p>
      <p begin="00:11:15.520" end="00:11:19.820">...start by taking the storage account actually and opening</p>
      <p begin="00:11:19.820" end="00:11:26.560">up configured connecting this to the cloud.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:26.560" end="00:11:29.360">Here's my storage connection string it says right now</p>
      <p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:33.490">use developments storage equals true I'm going to replace start.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:33.490" end="00:11:44.310">With...string for a demo accounts that I've set up already.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:44.310" end="00:11:47.070">And, what the shows here</p>
      <p begin="00:11:47.070" end="00:11:53.190">is a couple of things one you have the protocol</p>
      <p begin="00:11:53.190" end="00:11:56.100">and point you will typically said this...https?</p>
      <p begin="00:11:57.110" end="00:12:01.830">The only reason you set http if you're doing development work and you want to debug this makes it a little</p>
      <p begin="00:12:01.830" end="00:12:04.360">easier to work with a network tracer</p>
      <p begin="00:12:04.360" end="00:12:10.710">...or what have you have...and then you have an account key okay?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.710" end="00:12:18.330">So, we've set that up we've saved that let's run this again.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:18.330" end="00:12:26.220">And, now as you can notice here I'm running against a.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:26.220" end="00:12:30.610">Running against the asher...this is live code running we've</p>
      <p begin="00:12:30.610" end="00:12:37.720">connected to this account demos fifteen and we've gone ahead and done some operations here.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:37.720" end="00:12:41.780">So, let's look at what operations we were actually doing right so</p>
      <p begin="00:12:41.780" end="00:12:46.010">we've kind of connected we've created a container</p>
      <p begin="00:12:46.010" end="00:12:50.500">...object hierarchy or the mario data hierarchy for blob storage</p>
      <p begin="00:12:50.500" end="00:12:54.560">is...within a...container all data</p>
      <p begin="00:12:54.560" end="00:12:59.210">then you have a concept of a container think of it as a directory...you will that you can, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:59.210" end="00:13:01.850">set we isolation things are you can set</p>
      <p begin="00:13:01.850" end="00:13:06.380">shared access signatures which allow you resource isolation you can do atomic operations against</p>
      <p begin="00:13:06.380" end="00:13:10.560">the container like dropping everything and it and, then you store blobs inside</p>
      <p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:16.160">these containers so we create the container if it doesn't exist we then go ahead</p>
      <p begin="00:13:16.160" end="00:13:21.800">and upload a block blob right so we go ahead and get a</p>
      <p begin="00:13:21.800" end="00:13:26.870">...bob reference with ourimage that...uploading and we upload that so with</p>
      <p begin="00:13:26.870" end="00:13:31.400">a single api can go ahead and upload and then go ahead and list all the blobs</p>
      <p begin="00:13:31.400" end="00:13:36.350">in that container I download the blob again and then I delete</p>
      <p begin="00:13:36.350" end="00:13:45.630">the blob right...just trying to clean-up so I'm going-to go ahead and comment this...</p>
      <p begin="00:13:45.630" end="00:13:49.750">And, then go ahead and comment this out here.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:49.750" end="00:13:56.120">So, we don't...the other thing I'm going to do is I'd like to access this blob once</p>
      <p begin="00:13:56.120" end="00:13:57.070">it's created</p>
      <p begin="00:13:57.070" end="00:14:01.920">so in the sample code is this little note about saying hey if you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:14:01.920" end="00:14:06.880">set the container to be public you can go ahead and do that so I've just</p>
      <p begin="00:14:06.880" end="00:14:14.370">uncommon to that line of code I'm going-to go ahead and run this sample again?</p>
      <p begin="00:14:14.370" end="00:14:17.370">And, at this point I should be able to see the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:17.370" end="00:14:21.470">block law and I'm going to show that you a couple of different ways.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:21.470" end="00:14:29.150">The first of course is just let's go look at in...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:29.150" end="00:14:32.670">So, simple enough I can richard...public.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:32.670" end="00:14:37.660">But, if it weren't public I can also look at it and visual studio with the sdk you get</p>
      <p begin="00:14:37.660" end="00:14:42.570">a nice little storage explore built-in I can open up storage here open up</p>
      <p begin="00:14:42.570" end="00:14:48.400">the demos fifteen account and I can open up the blobs.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:48.400" end="00:14:53.110">And, let's go look at our demo container block blob that...created and hear this</p>
      <p begin="00:14:53.110" end="00:14:58.050">and it is utc yep nine fifteen so we're looking at this</p>
      <p begin="00:14:58.050" end="00:15:07.680">and we can see that even for a private blob you can kind of go through and browse things as needed.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:07.680" end="00:15:12.460">The other thing that we want to do is, you know, obviously this being a sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:12.460" end="00:15:14.230">We don't have a lot of error handling here,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:14.230" end="00:15:18.380">you know, in a production code...have exception handling...looking for</p>
      <p begin="00:15:19.590" end="00:15:24.230">common exception codes and things like that catching them and doing something with them so,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:24.230" end="00:15:28.420">I'm going to quickly insert a small snippet of code here and talk</p>
      <p begin="00:15:28.420" end="00:15:33.960">to what that allows me to do so let's take this upload.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:33.960" end="00:15:40.000">lob line and then replace it with my code.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:41.160">And, what this code does is</p>
      <p begin="00:15:41.160" end="00:15:45.660">...things the first thing is does is it overrides the operation</p>
      <p begin="00:15:45.660" end="00:15:49.640">context client request id the client request id is</p>
      <p begin="00:15:49.640" end="00:15:53.870">a field that the client library automatically generates for-you and gives you</p>
      <p begin="00:15:53.870" end="00:15:59.120">good but you can override it with anything you want and the reason you'd want to do this</p>
      <p begin="00:15:59.120" end="00:16:03.870">is typically a request for you is maybe a set of transactions</p>
      <p begin="00:16:03.870" end="00:16:08.450">to storage and you want to tie them all together and look at them as one entity when you do your</p>
      <p begin="00:16:08.450" end="00:16:12.570">dab odp story in this case I've just sort of said hey my client request ideas</p>
      <p begin="00:16:12.570" end="00:16:14.000">...string?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:14.000" end="00:16:17.630">And, the next thing I'm doing is adding a little bit of exception handling around here</p>
      <p begin="00:16:17.630" end="00:16:23.040">right so I'm trying to upload the blob and if I havel problem I'm just going to</p>
      <p begin="00:16:23.040" end="00:16:35.010">...the exception and log some information here so let's go ahead and run that again.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:35.010" end="00:16:39.970">Let's see what we are.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:39.970" end="00:16:49.870">So, I forgot to add a reference here.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:49.870" end="00:16:52.530">And, what that was doing?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:52.530" end="00:17:01.790">Basically even though it's some sort of the wrong place here.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:01.790" end="00:17:06.390">Taking care of service point manager the default connection lebed is something that allows you to</p>
      <p begin="00:17:06.390" end="00:17:10.500">the default connection limit for dot net is to connections if you're trying to do doesn't matter much for</p>
      <p begin="00:17:10.500" end="00:17:15.500">this demo but if you're trying to do a lot moredata you can you want to set this a little bit</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.500" end="00:17:20.530">higher used in algal is very useful for table and tables and</p>
      <p begin="00:17:20.530" end="00:17:23.900">...especially if you have small entities nagging</p>
      <p begin="00:17:23.900" end="00:17:27.460">ties to aggregate data together before sending</p>
      <p begin="00:17:27.460" end="00:17:30.930">on packets and it's really hard performance</p>
      <p begin="00:17:30.930" end="00:17:39.600">...do in dealing with small amounts of data so let's try to compile that?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:39.600" end="00:17:42.540">Gone ahead and run and.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:42.540" end="00:17:46.160">You see here though it's also failed right</p>
      <p begin="00:17:46.160" end="00:17:50.910">because I deleted by commented out the blob deletion I got a photo</p>
      <p begin="00:17:50.910" end="00:17:54.380">nine error back that said hey this blob.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:54.380" end="00:17:55.260">Already exists.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:56.560" end="00:18:00.830">And, we give you a friendly...code we give you a daytime stab me give you</p>
      <p begin="00:18:00.830" end="00:18:06.530">this thing which is a server request id and that's a unique id that</p>
      <p begin="00:18:06.530" end="00:18:11.270">the service generates and sends back to in this is also useful we'll see later in our</p>
      <p begin="00:18:11.270" end="00:18:14.430">demo we'll take this id and use it to</p>
      <p begin="00:18:14.430" end="00:18:25.280">do some debugging all right so let me get rid of that let me copy this out.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:25.280" end="00:18:33.480">All right so I'll just say that for now and get...here.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:33.480" end="00:18:40.690">Coming back to our presentation.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:40.690" end="00:18:45.460">Ok, so, that's kind of a quick overview of how to use...blobs and I think the big take away</p>
      <p begin="00:18:45.460" end="00:18:48.830">their is you can get started very quickly very easily with</p>
      <p begin="00:18:48.830" end="00:18:56.590">this quick start samples and you can explore and, you know, kind of branch out from there.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:56.590" end="00:18:59.160">So, let's talk about tables.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:59.160" end="00:19:02.900">Tables rr no sequel often they are use</p>
      <p begin="00:19:02.900" end="00:19:07.520">anytime you want to store semi-structured...structured data and.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:07.520" end="00:19:12.370">They're really about storing schema less entities the big feature that we give</p>
      <p begin="00:19:12.370" end="00:19:16.560">use we do dynamic load balancing there's no real limit on the number of rows are the size of</p>
      <p begin="00:19:16.560" end="00:19:21.380">the table you can grow as much as finer...was the size of an account and we</p>
      <p begin="00:19:21.380" end="00:19:26.130">take care of observing which regions of your table are hot getting a lot of rights are</p>
      <p begin="00:19:26.130" end="00:19:30.960">a lot of reeds and we load balance automatically across hundreds of servers in</p>
      <p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:36.320">our service so you don't never have to worry about,... what's my scale unit how do I do this</p>
      <p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:41.070">the other thing that we do is provide entity group transactions if you're trying</p>
      <p begin="00:19:41.070" end="00:19:44.800">to do group transactions atomically we do have that within a</p>
      <p begin="00:19:44.800" end="00:19:48.930">partition outdo node that we're key value store so</p>
      <p begin="00:19:48.930" end="00:19:53.510">...really optimized for key value lookup where you provide us the partition key and the...and there</p>
      <p begin="00:19:53.510" end="00:19:59.360">are other data offerings and as...if you're trying to do something more interesting a richer the</p>
      <p begin="00:19:59.360" end="00:20:03.580">...of tables is really enormously high scale and also enormous</p>
      <p begin="00:20:03.580" end="00:20:08.510">great cost efficiency if your data pattern fits what we offer</p>
      <p begin="00:20:08.510" end="00:20:13.660">I'm going to come over here and show you a very quick preview of table</p>
      <p begin="00:20:13.660" end="00:20:19.130">search mainly to point out that it looks and feels.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:19.130" end="00:20:21.090">Exactly like.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:21.090" end="00:20:22.780">Blob storage so you have here.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:24.770" end="00:20:29.080">Sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:29.080" end="00:20:29.300">Again,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:29.300" end="00:20:34.090">I have the same lines here and it layers said natal is more useful here but</p>
      <p begin="00:20:34.090" end="00:20:39.010">let's look at what we're doing the table a...does the same thing starts with</p>
      <p begin="00:20:39.010" end="00:20:42.860">the storage account gets a table client reference and then goes ahead and</p>
      <p begin="00:20:42.860" end="00:20:47.150">creates the table if it doesn't exist.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:47.150" end="00:20:49.850">Table operations.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:49.850" end="00:20:52.640">For tables you need to have a cost, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:52.640" end="00:20:57.250">a entity...entity objects in this case we have a customer and</p>
      <p begin="00:20:57.250" end="00:21:01.080">we've inherited from table entity and that's the allows you</p>
      <p begin="00:21:01.080" end="00:21:06.430">to specify partition key and role key that really is</p>
      <p begin="00:21:06.430" end="00:21:13.270">what are the indexes we allow and what you do your lookup spy?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:13.270" end="00:21:16.930">Coming back here so inserting in</p>
      <p begin="00:21:16.930" end="00:21:20.990">...doing and insert and actually and upsurge here insert or march</p>
      <p begin="00:21:20.990" end="00:21:24.640">...retrieve that entity and we delete entity again just</p>
      <p begin="00:21:24.640" end="00:21:29.400">as simple as operating with blobs let's go ahead and run this one as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:29.400" end="00:21:33.510">And, you'll see does a couple of other things it also does batch inserts and batch</p>
      <p begin="00:21:33.510" end="00:21:39.140">retrievals so that's kind of you know, just generated a little bit of load for the purposes of our</p>
      <p begin="00:21:39.140" end="00:21:42.890">dev ops right so let's go back to.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:42.890" end="00:21:49.090">Presentation.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:49.090" end="00:21:53.890">...are reliable messaging system at scale accuser really useful when</p>
      <p begin="00:21:53.890" end="00:21:57.760">you have other asher services that you've built and you need to</p>
      <p begin="00:21:57.760" end="00:22:02.560">decouple your components and be able to scale them independently if you have your canonical sort</p>

      <p begin="00:22:05.030" end="00:22:08.670">...between them so you could hand-off work asynchronous</p>
      <p begin="00:22:08.670" end="00:22:13.160">...to the workers and then your web role can scale independently for worker</p>
      <p begin="00:22:13.160" end="00:22:16.940">roles right so you use it for this you also use it</p>
      <p begin="00:22:16.940" end="00:22:20.210">for the scheduling asynchronous faster building any kind of workflows</p>
      <p begin="00:22:21.270" end="00:22:25.610">...allow you to guarantee that work gets done so</p>
      <p begin="00:22:25.610" end="00:22:29.690">the one feature that we have a something we call invisible message invisibility</p>
      <p begin="00:22:29.690" end="00:22:33.620">timeout and basically what this means is once you dq a message you</p>
      <p begin="00:22:33.620" end="00:22:36.300">can only decode with the timeout if</p>
      <p begin="00:22:36.300" end="00:22:41.090">your worker crashes during processing off that message your message</p>
      <p begin="00:22:41.090" end="00:22:44.120">will reappear in the...for another worker to</p>
      <p begin="00:22:44.120" end="00:22:47.980">pick-up and complete we also provide an update message functionality so</p>
      <p begin="00:22:47.980" end="00:22:53.020">you can periodically checkpoint your progress from a worker if you</p>

      <p begin="00:22:55.570" end="00:23:01.720">over of from scratch so those are two kind of interesting features to look at with</p>
      <p begin="00:23:01.720" end="00:23:05.330">Not going to run the q demo it looks pretty similar to the blobs and</p>

      <p begin="00:23:29.670" end="00:23:32.360">slide there's a nice little architecture</p>
      <p begin="00:23:32.360" end="00:23:36.690">clean consistent architecture of api eyes and their access you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:36.690" end="00:23:41.650">we have a set of...aps...service level for blobs...containers for tables</p>

      <p begin="00:23:45.070" end="00:23:50.430">is that manipulate either blobs table entities or q messages</p>
      <p begin="00:23:50.430" end="00:23:53.290">...very consistent programming paradigm</p>

      <p begin="00:24:35.810" end="00:24:39.940">we talked about earlier optimized for random access the nice thing here is</p>
      <p begin="00:24:39.940" end="00:24:44.440">you get three synchronous strongly consistent copies of your data when you write</p>
      <p begin="00:24:44.440" end="00:24:48.530">and aggregated disc so you don't have to worry about what, you know,</p>

      <p begin="00:25:02.630" end="00:25:09.040">to build really scale-up workloads so let's take a quick look at</p>
      <p begin="00:25:09.040" end="00:25:12.930">They're really useful if you're trying to have a workload that needs very</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.930" end="00:25:17.900">consistently low latency in the single digit milliseconds and very predictable high</p>

      <p begin="00:25:37.330" end="00:25:42.230">...as the based offering you get those three strongly consistent copy so you're not</p>
      <p begin="00:25:42.230" end="00:25:46.980">needing to worry about data durability we have because it's</p>
      <p begin="00:25:46.980" end="00:25:51.540">a provision offering you buy it a little bit differently from basic blob storage</p>
      <p begin="00:25:51.540" end="00:25:55.360">you can abiding units of hundred-twenty a gigs five twelve or</p>
      <p begin="00:25:55.360" end="00:26:05.950">time twenty-four gigabyte disks and you have different performance numbers for each one of those.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:05.950" end="00:26:11.290">Files is another interesting offering whoops.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:11.290" end="00:26:15.890">Measure files...allow you to get shared access</p>
      <p begin="00:26:15.890" end="00:26:19.210">disks right shared this of the data this a persistent</p>
      <p begin="00:26:19.210" end="00:26:22.050">...are attached to a vm their essentially like,</p>

      <p begin="00:26:35.280" end="00:26:40.110">...expect of shared disks just work right it's natively supported by the operated</p>
      <p begin="00:26:40.110" end="00:26:43.700">...operating systems and it just works it's built on top of</p>
      <p begin="00:26:43.700" end="00:26:49.020">smb two-point-one and there's no limits again on the number of shares you can create an actor storage</p>
      <p begin="00:26:49.020" end="00:26:52.990">...each share can be up to five terabytes and size and about a thousand I</p>

      <p begin="00:27:05.540" end="00:27:13.020">...something else to consider when you...your code?</p>
      <p begin="00:27:13.020" end="00:27:16.110">Other complementary asher data offerings, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:16.110" end="00:27:20.220">we just heard about data lake which is big data analytics within</p>
      <p begin="00:27:20.220" end="00:27:24.790">...interface...building on top of...storage as well so all...data that you</p>

      <p begin="00:27:30.500" end="00:27:35.620">a json document store instead of in the no sequel family you want to look at document</p>
      <p begin="00:27:35.620" end="00:27:39.410">dvd and of course you're interested in full-blown relational databases</p>
      <p begin="00:27:39.410" end="00:27:42.730">...equal db gives you a great offering that's a manage database.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:43.800" end="00:27:45.330">And, finally if you're looking</p>
      <p begin="00:27:45.330" end="00:27:49.600">...would say I need a little bit more of rich q offerings</p>
      <p begin="00:27:49.600" end="00:27:56.820">that pub sob in order delivery things like that you may want to look at service box.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:56.820" end="00:28:03.360">So, after... kind of the architecture of storage is essentially built on top</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:05.590">of one common platform right we</p>
      <p begin="00:28:05.590" end="00:28:09.500">have one distributed file system massive distributed file system.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:10.570" end="00:28:15.290">Tens hundreds of petabytes of data in each region and you have a</p>
      <p begin="00:28:15.290" end="00:28:19.380">scale out layer and a load balancing layer on top of that so that...</p>
      <p begin="00:28:19.380" end="00:28:24.120">application layer we call it the stream layer is where used the data is physically store</p>
      <p begin="00:28:24.120" end="00:28:28.990">and the partition layer is where all the metadata the indexing...of detection of</p>
      <p begin="00:28:28.990" end="00:28:33.600">than in a...and dynamically load balancing it happens and finally on top</p>
      <p begin="00:28:33.600" end="00:28:39.130">is the front-ends that you communicate with for with your rest calls you authentication</p>
      <p begin="00:28:39.130" end="00:28:44.560">...all of that happens on top of those two layers so this is interesting because</p>
      <p begin="00:28:44.560" end="00:28:49.320">by having one common software stack it really allows us to give you a</p>
      <p begin="00:28:49.320" end="00:28:53.640">common feature set a very consistent look and feel for the programming</p>
      <p begin="00:28:53.640" end="00:28:56.910">and the api...and it allows us to also give you</p>
      <p begin="00:28:56.910" end="00:29:01.300">...pass on the economies of scale that we get by mixing</p>
      <p begin="00:29:01.300" end="00:29:05.170">...block blob workloads with...table workloads</p>
      <p begin="00:29:05.170" end="00:29:12.010">...q workloads so we can kind of makes all those workloads together do it very efficiently.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:12.010" end="00:29:16.260">And, it also allows us to give you all of these capabilities, you know, for all of</p>
      <p begin="00:29:16.260" end="00:29:21.210">our offerings right so if you look at scaleability we have per account we can do finer</p>
      <p begin="00:29:21.210" end="00:29:26.080">terabytes of data twenty thousand transactions per second and up to ten gigs of</p>

      <p begin="00:29:48.380" end="00:29:52.610">we do have multiple access control and analytics capabilities but I'll</p>
      <p begin="00:29:52.610" end="00:29:55.900">let my colleague jason kind of walk you through those things</p>
      <p begin="00:29:55.900" end="00:30:03.170">where demos and other things so jason...</p>
      <p begin="00:30:03.170" end="00:30:04.960">So, eventually...provide an introduction</p>
      <p begin="00:30:04.960" end="00:30:08.850">...storage platform as well as what sort of how to actually get started writing</p>
      <p begin="00:30:08.850" end="00:30:12.550">...applications when things I'm going to talk about is how do I</p>
      <p begin="00:30:12.550" end="00:30:17.190">start thinking about preparing replication from when it goes into production last thing you</p>
      <p begin="00:30:17.190" end="00:30:21.620">want to do is build a cloud scale application put it in production and not have processes in place</p>
      <p begin="00:30:21.620" end="00:30:27.250">from monitoring or diagnosing issues when they do occur you can imagine at cloud scale</p>
      <p begin="00:30:27.250" end="00:30:31.200">...one-in-a-million operations failing for our platform</p>
      <p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:35.400">main six operations failing every second that would be a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:30:35.400" end="00:30:38.300">...time chasing down issues that could be</p>
      <p begin="00:30:38.300" end="00:30:41.130">spent of creating new features so we obviously</p>
      <p begin="00:30:41.130" end="00:30:48.800">have extensive develops capabilities within a platform and we've exposed a lot of those...to actually use as well?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:48.800" end="00:30:54.050">So,...do have to think about it was sort of this three different ways you want to think about sort of monitoring the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:54.050" end="00:30:58.780">first is if you're selling a solution to...you...the eyes that you've committed</p>
      <p begin="00:30:58.780" end="00:31:03.830">...customers and all that you're actually committing...you want to make sure the amazing secondly</p>
      <p begin="00:31:03.830" end="00:31:07.160">want to try to identify issues before you customers do</p>
      <p begin="00:31:07.160" end="00:31:11.710">...you've got the sort of service fundamentals service...service availability performance</p>
      <p begin="00:31:11.710" end="00:31:18.190">scaleability capacity those sorts of things the wanna-be tracking on an ongoing basis.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:18.190" end="00:31:23.110">...think about monitoring...to main ways to actually think about the first is outside</p>
      <p begin="00:31:23.110" end="00:31:27.470">...this is way basically when you actually have agents running on the outside</p>
      <p begin="00:31:27.470" end="00:31:31.830">of your application performing synthetic transactions simulating</p>
      <p begin="00:31:31.830" end="00:31:35.830">...your actual uses behavior microsoft as a tool</p>
      <p begin="00:31:35.830" end="00:31:38.670">...is also external products gomez and keynote</p>
      <p begin="00:31:38.670" end="00:31:44.180">...a very good for this of outside in monitoring outside in is also a very good for actually isolating issues</p>
      <p begin="00:31:44.180" end="00:31:48.360">to...network outages because quite often you'll have a person one region complaining</p>
      <p begin="00:31:48.360" end="00:31:52.550">about network latency very hard to diagnose and these tools make it very</p>
      <p begin="00:31:52.550" end="00:31:57.940">easy then this inside out and this is what I'm going to spend a majority of the time talking about whereby</p>
      <p begin="00:31:57.940" end="00:32:02.840">within your application of instrumented it such that you can actually monitor...alerts</p>
      <p begin="00:32:02.840" end="00:32:07.580">and then investigates as necessary the storage platform has two sets ofand,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:07.580" end="00:32:12.600">capabilities metrics and logs that walk through ...libraries also include logging</p>
      <p begin="00:32:12.600" end="00:32:17.980">but you can enable should you need to at times see may need to look at what's going on in the network</p>
      <p begin="00:32:17.980" end="00:32:22.570">...out some tools of useful for that and if you think is actually issues with the actual with a</p>
      <p begin="00:32:22.570" end="00:32:29.050">particular workload...availability ...a portable has a service health dashboard.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:29.050" end="00:32:32.720">So, the first them to talk about is metrics basis really think about metrics</p>
      <p begin="00:32:32.720" end="00:32:37.280">is equivalent to perf...and windows service-type environment</p>
      <p begin="00:32:37.280" end="00:32:40.970">...by this forty different types of metrics that are available for blobs tables and</p>
      <p begin="00:32:40.970" end="00:32:45.500">...and that allow you to actually monitor the house of those</p>
      <p begin="00:32:45.500" end="00:32:51.000">capabilities one of the key differences is that even though you may have</p>
      <p begin="00:32:51.000" end="00:32:56.280">...service has no flood of service...and the...we aggregate all of that information and actually</p>
      <p begin="00:32:56.280" end="00:33:02.790">...the metrics are available a and hourly and minute level...the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:02.790" end="00:33:08.200">all these very good for taking a look at sort of trends...last a week month so forth the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:08.200" end="00:33:11.600">...and minute level...metrics a very good if you're actually trying to actually</p>
      <p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:16.550">determine app drill into a problem and the both metrics and...</p>
      <p begin="00:33:16.550" end="00:33:21.940">and they actually specify granularity operation types that you want to log and retention policies</p>
      <p begin="00:33:23.040" end="00:33:30.020">...metrics registered in tables logging information is stored in ...</p>
      <p begin="00:33:30.020" end="00:33:35.280">All right I'm going to switch over to the new as...portal and what I'm going to do</p>
      <p begin="00:33:35.280" end="00:33:40.190">is actually drill into storage accounts and storage account I've been running by</p>
      <p begin="00:33:40.190" end="00:33:45.940">test application on a is over here today how test-tube and</p>
      <p begin="00:33:45.940" end="00:33:51.450">...is take a look first of all it provides the top of the portal it was of some</p>
      <p begin="00:33:51.450" end="00:33:56.690">...of things you can see...configured my account type outrage ers so this is sort of the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:56.690" end="00:34:00.800">...them she was talking about whereby whenever I rights to my primary location</p>
      <p begin="00:34:00.800" end="00:34:04.900">it's automatically getting replicated to a second location plus I can also read from</p>
      <p begin="00:34:04.900" end="00:34:09.190">that second location which is very helpful when you building highly available applications</p>
      <p begin="00:34:09.190" end="00:34:15.930">...walk you through some code that demonstrates that...I'm just going to collapse?</p>
      <p begin="00:34:15.930" end="00:34:21.360">A mouse seems to be playing.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:21.360" end="00:34:28.580">Interesting the slide and the mouse do not get along this line.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:28.580" end="00:34:30.970">Collapse that.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:30.970" end="00:34:32.770">...there.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:32.770" end="00:34:39.690">And, what you can see here is dashboard and that is actually fully customizable right now what</p>
      <p begin="00:34:39.690" end="00:34:43.380">is showing is the...requests?</p>
      <p begin="00:34:43.380" end="00:34:50.109">And, sharing right now it's showing them for the last are also.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:50.109" end="00:34:52.889">But, what I can do is at this chart</p>
      <p begin="00:34:54.310" end="00:34:59.150">...of the mouses misbehaving and I can do a couple things here first of all I can actually change the time</p>
      <p begin="00:34:59.150" end="00:35:04.320">range so first...have it set up right now for custom and drilling into a fifteen minute period but,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:04.320" end="00:35:08.530">if I actually...to take a look at say passed out and I can also look at microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:35:08.530" end="00:35:11.690">...forty different characteristics of blobs</p>
      <p begin="00:35:11.690" end="00:35:15.060">or tables haven't been using q so that's why didn't pop of that</p>
      <p begin="00:35:15.060" end="00:35:20.610">and that could be looking at right now I'm looking at to requests I can save</p>
      <p begin="00:35:20.610" end="00:35:23.960">...I can actually see we should actually see the data for the last hour and you can see</p>
      <p begin="00:35:23.960" end="00:35:27.280">...about an hour before the presentation was getting my demo ready sequences of</p>
      <p begin="00:35:27.280" end="00:35:32.260">...by...because I want to be a dashboard is not just the number of request that are interesting to</p>
      <p begin="00:35:32.260" end="00:35:37.170">me one if the one of the largest sort of areas where I've seen customers</p>
      <p begin="00:35:37.170" end="00:35:42.550">want resistances deployed...application...customers say it it's performing</p>
      <p begin="00:35:42.550" end="00:35:48.070">...and it's...sporadic so here's a couple counters that...while...taking a look at into</p>
      <p begin="00:35:48.070" end="00:35:53.140">and latency and average...latency what these metrics show you...several latency is the time that</p>
      <p begin="00:35:53.140" end="00:35:57.780">we actually spent performing an operation on...service end-to-end latency I should try</p>
      <p begin="00:35:57.780" end="00:36:02.750">to the time it takes from the client to establish a connection to the storage service the time it</p>
      <p begin="00:36:02.750" end="00:36:04.340">...perform that operation and the times</p>
      <p begin="00:36:04.340" end="00:36:08.550">...the up all the data to the actual...so it's a really good indicator of</p>
      <p begin="00:36:08.550" end="00:36:13.080">when things maybe going wrong on the network so in this case you can see here and</p>
      <p begin="00:36:13.080" end="00:36:16.490">...up every time it took for us server to actually perform the</p>
      <p begin="00:36:16.490" end="00:36:21.400">operations was five milliseconds the average end-to-end latency was...hundred sixty four</p>
      <p begin="00:36:21.400" end="00:36:26.630">milliseconds so you can see...sixty milliseconds just of network time involved in that request</p>
      <p begin="00:36:26.630" end="00:36:31.420">...not to...that was from the hotel...those sorts of things but,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:31.420" end="00:36:37.980">very useful ...so, for troubleshooting and the other thing...can do is very useful</p>
      <p begin="00:36:37.980" end="00:36:41.170">fresh monitoring is you can actually create alerts so,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:41.170" end="00:36:45.750">now...way...actually credit condition such as</p>
      <p begin="00:36:45.750" end="00:36:48.540">...on latency?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:48.540" end="00:36:49.860">Alerts.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:49.860" end="00:36:52.320">Where I can basically specify?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:55.900">That are specific metric maybe.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:55.900" end="00:36:59.760">Average intern latency is greater than that's</p>
      <p begin="00:36:59.760" end="00:37:03.970">a thousand milliseconds over the last five minutes when I said</p>
      <p begin="00:37:03.970" end="00:37:08.930">...to my administrators so there's a good example of...you try to actually credit policy that allows you</p>
      <p begin="00:37:08.930" end="00:37:12.820">to get ahead of the customers rather than them having you call you up and tell them that</p>
      <p begin="00:37:12.820" end="00:37:16.430">something's going wrong you can credit policy along...size.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:16.430" end="00:37:21.010">...I've just done that.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:21.010" end="00:37:32.200">So, that's a quick look at metrics and one thing I didn't mention was the analytics platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:32.200" end="00:37:35.670">And, this is not enabled by default so...we do recommend as while you're doing</p>
      <p begin="00:37:35.670" end="00:37:40.210">a developments and create account go into the pool and enableboth</p>
      <p begin="00:37:40.210" end="00:37:45.560">...metrics and definitely helpful when you have to stat troubleshooting.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:45.560" end="00:37:50.840">So, metrics...you actually observe the behavior of application is system sometimes</p>
      <p begin="00:37:50.840" end="00:37:52.730">...metrics information on own will give you</p>
      <p begin="00:37:52.730" end="00:37:56.600">...what's going on we sort of gave an example that the oftentimes</p>
      <p begin="00:37:56.600" end="00:38:01.700">...drill into log data to actually see what's going on so that's we have something called</p>
      <p begin="00:38:01.700" end="00:38:06.970">blogs and think...in semis is sort of equivalent of biases locks every single rest</p>
      <p begin="00:38:06.970" end="00:38:10.560">operation is performed can be logged and we allow you to a</p>
      <p begin="00:38:10.560" end="00:38:14.120">...specify subset of those so, for example, you any</p>
      <p begin="00:38:15.160" end="00:38:20.100">...updates to actually be logged you could do that as well if you want to actually reduce the size of the log files the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:20.100" end="00:38:23.680">log entries includes...all the its information...would expect inside</p>
      <p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:28.330">...operation the endpoint was calls the time it took the size of the message all that sort</p>
      <p begin="00:38:28.330" end="00:38:35.240">of stuff very useful for troubleshooting and what I'm going to do right now?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:35.240" end="00:38:38.520">Is image...do this live</p>
      <p begin="00:38:38.520" end="00:38:40.940">and see-saw earlier them she was?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:42.040" end="00:38:44.270">And, performing set of operations against.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:52.070">points and, what I'm going to do is you use a tool called a</p>
      <p begin="00:38:52.070" end="00:38:56.100">...and which is sort of think about this is a file copy utility that allows</p>
      <p begin="00:38:56.100" end="00:39:01.210">actually copy data from on premises to the cloud from the cloud batch on premises</p>
      <p begin="00:39:01.210" end="00:39:06.130">and in this case what I'm going to do is actually copy all of the log files...creative of m she was actually running</p>
      <p begin="00:39:06.130" end="00:39:13.040">his demo against them as fifteen...into my file system?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:15.750">Well, see that's actually eighty four files</p>
      <p begin="00:39:15.750" end="00:39:25.850">...copied and hopefully they will actually show up...</p>
      <p begin="00:39:25.850" end="00:39:29.240">So, they're actually copied into their respective sort of workload</p>
      <p begin="00:39:29.240" end="00:39:33.770">...copied and by blob by...and.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:33.770" end="00:39:36.530">Finally and the log files basically structured...of</p>
      <p begin="00:39:36.530" end="00:39:40.750">...five-minute intervals you open them up they're actually a little bit</p>
      <p begin="00:39:40.750" end="00:39:45.360">...to actually do anything useful with...so one of the tools that we've</p>
      <p begin="00:39:45.360" end="00:39:50.180">actually spent quite a lot of time working with is a tool called message analyzer...analyzers a for</p>
      <p begin="00:39:50.180" end="00:39:55.440">...can download it actually came comes from the...written created met...which I'm sure many</p>
      <p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:40:00.340">people have used what this actually allows you to do is basically create a session</p>
      <p begin="00:40:00.340" end="00:40:05.260">and what we can actually do is add files and what I'm going to do here...</p>
      <p begin="00:40:06.400" end="00:40:17.450">...import all of the logs...just downloaded.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.450" end="00:40:19.470">...in this case essential</p>
      <p begin="00:40:19.470" end="00:40:23.820">...small amount of...we can just loaded and process and but if you actually had like</p>
      <p begin="00:40:23.820" end="00:40:28.280">...with the data...a staff...and filter to specify stat time and end-time</p>
      <p begin="00:40:28.280" end="00:40:33.150">...go through a logs...pull out the log entries that fall into that criteria you can also</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.190" end="00:40:37.010">establish an session filter.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:37.010" end="00:40:42.110">And, if you wanted to actually have more advanced filtering such as looking for all status codes of three</p>
      <p begin="00:40:42.110" end="00:40:47.830">hundred more you could do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:47.830" end="00:40:49.960">...over here.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:49.960" end="00:40:52.040">Once again.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:52.040" end="00:40:55.760">So, associate import that data.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:55.760" end="00:41:00.480">So, again, what we've got here is the default view of that data and we're going to do right now is actually choose we've got a</p>
      <p begin="00:41:00.480" end="00:41:05.020">stores like...that which gives us like...strongly...view of the data and</p>
      <p begin="00:41:05.020" end="00:41:09.480">the ability that she query at...match...</p>
      <p begin="00:41:09.480" end="00:41:14.370">...behaving so you can actually see now all of...entries that we've actually just imported available in this</p>
      <p begin="00:41:14.370" end="00:41:17.980">too which is kind of useful but,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:17.980" end="00:41:24.770">it gets even more interesting is still an awful lot of data and I'm trying to actually work out why that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:24.770" end="00:41:30.440">...on the...what we can actually do is actually rights strongly typed queries</p>
      <p begin="00:41:30.440" end="00:41:34.350">...as your storage log dot letter anything maybe that has a status</p>
      <p begin="00:41:34.350" end="00:41:39.250">code of more than two hundred ninety nine because that tends to buy something,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:39.250" end="00:41:44.150">something...expenses...so what we've come through now is actually filtered through all</p>
      <p begin="00:41:44.150" end="00:41:48.560">the data and if you remember them she also she customize the client request</p>
      <p begin="00:41:48.560" end="00:41:53.980">id so we can actually see straight away their the actual the particulates and the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:53.980" end="00:41:58.420">specific operation that found and is here we can...look as a put blah-blah-blah aeration</p>
      <p begin="00:41:59.480" end="00:42:04.570">...four nine four nine scenarios...some kind of concurrency issues</p>
      <p begin="00:42:04.570" end="00:42:09.160">occured and straight away they can actually have a pretty good sense of what was going on and sort of give it to</p>
      <p begin="00:42:09.160" end="00:42:14.990">uses this tools also very useful finding patterns any data so we basically got a number of different sort</p>
      <p begin="00:42:14.990" end="00:42:19.320">of best practices that we've identified and, you can actually search for that things that</p>
      <p begin="00:42:19.320" end="00:42:24.430">...those mentioned there's a...in here for actually detecting if you should be enabling neighbor</p>
      <p begin="00:42:24.430" end="00:42:29.580">...one last thing this tools very useful for is...</p>
      <p begin="00:42:29.580" end="00:42:35.850">You'll...that she will come back to the second and...of...</p>
      <p begin="00:42:35.850" end="00:42:48.300">Okay, so, we talked about metrics to about logs.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:48.300" end="00:42:51.890">We also have...logging so this is basically inside each about client libraries</p>
      <p begin="00:42:51.890" end="00:42:54.060">...consistent...approach so actually doing</p>
      <p begin="00:42:54.060" end="00:43:01.620">logging very useful for enabling when you actually try to actually debug.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:01.620" end="00:43:05.910">The next thing you want to be thinking about is quite often especially wave got networking issues</p>
      <p begin="00:43:06.920" end="00:43:11.820">if you sort of getting sporadic network access from a specific region and you may</p>
      <p begin="00:43:11.820" end="00:43:16.220">...that using something like wash uncle message analyze which allows...capture network trays</p>
      <p begin="00:43:16.220" end="00:43:22.340">...tcp levels if there's something wacky going on lots of reconnect those sorts of things</p>
      <p begin="00:43:22.340" end="00:43:27.490">...just right now one of the challenges there is the sort of end up with</p>
      <p begin="00:43:27.490" end="00:43:33.300">...is server-side log data...networkssort of one...network analytics...</p>
      <p begin="00:43:33.300" end="00:43:38.270">put together I've got these client-side logs you can also log...actually stitching that together is really</p>
      <p begin="00:43:38.270" end="00:43:43.200">difficult when is cool things about message analyzers actual as a correlates and those</p>
      <p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:47.160">...files together safe remember we have that correlation id that we actually</p>
      <p begin="00:43:47.160" end="00:43:51.450">...clients actually also in hp...header...inside the stores</p>
      <p begin="00:43:51.450" end="00:43:56.090">...so...in this sort of...can...I've already loaded all of</p>
      <p begin="00:43:56.090" end="00:44:01.180">the client-side logs from a test of...lots and network trace...as you go</p>
      <p begin="00:44:01.180" end="00:44:06.400">into particular requests see the requested response and,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:06.400" end="00:44:11.180">I could actually...start looking through the record what...queries again not an overly useful</p>
      <p begin="00:44:11.180" end="00:44:14.760">...what I can also do is basically groupthe data</p>
      <p begin="00:44:16.210" end="00:44:20.580">...request a which point now what actually see as a correlated view of the data</p>
      <p begin="00:44:21.790" end="00:44:23.750">remote to a where,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:23.750" end="00:44:28.440">for example, if you actually have a specific...request id that...looking for?</p>

      <p begin="00:50:29.780" end="00:50:32.980">Encryption demos tend to be fairly and interesting and.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:34.240" end="00:50:36.290">But, we've got here is some running</p>

      <p begin="00:50:45.750" end="00:50:51.420">or you can see the on-again everybody should be...that's not to adjustable and then</p>
      <p begin="00:50:51.420" end="00:50:56.910">we can say-so again what we've done here is we...our upload blob capability under the cover that performs a number</p>

      <p begin="00:51:58.440" end="00:52:04.810">and again it's encrypted so-you nothing really interesting to see that?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:04.810" end="00:52:10.170">the key here is anybody's using a...libraries trivial to get up and running.</p>

      <p begin="00:56:58.420" end="00:57:04.020">...heard about today and all this week because today if you wanted to actually append</p>
      <p begin="00:57:04.020" end="00:57:08.860">data to the end of a blob...to do two things first of all those a series of api said to</p>

      <p begin="00:57:15.740" end="00:57:20.650">of time-consuming the other thing was if you have multiple clients doing that then have to work at</p>

      <p begin="00:57:21.850" end="00:57:26.820">...don't actually overwrite each other's data very difficult to do so we've got a new api</p>

      <p begin="00:57:33.820" end="00:57:38.170">...appliance writing directly the api as follows same conventions a</p>
      <p begin="00:57:38.170" end="00:57:43.640">block and capability say it'd be very easy to get right into the quick code sampled</p>
      <p begin="00:57:43.640" end="00:57:49.290">...went...it's exactly the same is blah-blah-blah for all intents and purposes the</p>
      <p begin="00:57:49.290" end="00:57:55.070">amp one final thing I wanted to talk about was designing highly available applications so,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:55.070" end="00:57:59.230">anything storage provides...events with the anyone...by...</p>
      <p begin="00:57:59.230" end="00:58:04.050">to actually have data replicated across regions...in addition to that you can also</p>
      <p begin="00:58:04.050" end="00:58:09.110">specify the second region and enables read access?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:09.110" end="00:58:13.960">So, if you actually build your application with this in mind you actually get for nine-zero availability that we committee</p>
      <p begin="00:58:13.960" end="00:58:18.810">by sla plant libraries include retry policies</p>
      <p begin="00:58:18.810" end="00:58:22.720">have a default algorithm which is exponential back off and what this means is</p>
      <p begin="00:58:22.720" end="00:58:26.910">that the actual client libraryallows...actually specify primary</p>
      <p begin="00:58:26.910" end="00:58:31.070">...secondary as its retry policy it will first try read</p>
      <p begin="00:58:31.070" end="00:58:34.290">...an operation on the primary if that fails</p>
      <p begin="00:58:34.290" end="00:58:38.320">then go to the secondary and versus a very sort of useful way for actually dealing with sort</p>
      <p begin="00:58:38.320" end="00:58:41.610">of trends in faults in particularso,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:41.610" end="00:58:45.390">the retry operation is stateless so it doesn't mean that one thing you have to think about</p>
      <p begin="00:58:45.390" end="00:58:50.500">the catastrophic outages we may lose the primary region or...upgrade which</p>
      <p begin="00:58:50.500" end="00:58:55.220">is very common scenario you might want to actually do two things one have you application work and read any</p>
      <p begin="00:58:55.220" end="00:58:59.150">...at least some functionally still available but secondly what you don't</p>
      <p begin="00:58:59.150" end="00:59:04.370">want to do is have every single operation...the primary...which the second-rate so there's a pattern</p>
      <p begin="00:59:04.370" end="00:59:08.430">...short-circuited which is an well-taken look at and...of a work as...implementation</p>
      <p begin="00:59:08.430" end="00:59:14.270">of that shelving the other thing that you...do when building nih application is simulate</p>
      <p begin="00:59:14.270" end="00:59:19.100">server-side failures and this is an ask we get a lots I'm going to show you how to do that right now</p>
      <p begin="00:59:19.100" end="00:59:22.450">...the kinds of conditions he could run into production you want to make sure the</p>
      <p begin="00:59:22.450" end="00:59:27.100">...you're actually doing development and quickly touch on the short-circuit pattern so</p>
      <p begin="00:59:27.100" end="00:59:32.330">again retry policies are ideal for trends in failures but,...second pattern prevents</p>
      <p begin="00:59:32.330" end="00:59:37.310">...application for repeatedly retrying...more severe issues short-circuit</p>
      <p begin="00:59:37.310" end="00:59:41.150">break can automatically detect resources come back...and switch back to primary switch</p>
      <p begin="00:59:41.150" end="00:59:46.820">application back to rewrite it the fundamental the...of the most important capability of taking advantage of</p>
      <p begin="00:59:46.820" end="00:59:51.610">...within the client library we have a retrying event that you can tap into</p>
      <p begin="00:59:51.610" end="00:59:55.980">...what I'm generates every time the retrying event is called it means</p>
      <p begin="00:59:55.980" end="01:00:00.230">something's failed we're doing a retry I'm doing so some very simple logic</p>
      <p begin="01:00:00.230" end="01:00:05.090">crime basically just establishing a threshold certain number of re tries...a certain period of time</p>
      <p begin="01:00:05.090" end="01:00:10.030">and...switch the app to read-only mode and I'm going to get all of my data from the</p>
      <p begin="01:00:10.030" end="01:00:13.860">second location so I will demonstrate this quickly?</p>
      <p begin="01:00:13.860" end="01:00:24.260">I'm also going to demonstrate away to actually generate the actual server-side faults.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:24.260" end="01:00:29.120">And, here's the shows are getting pattern and implemented so, again,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:29.120" end="01:00:33.960">it's basically just a standard block storage sample of retry</p>
      <p begin="01:00:33.960" end="01:00:38.720">...which is basically discounts I've got a threshold right now...for one which is basically just for</p>
      <p begin="01:00:38.720" end="01:00:42.690">the purposes of a demo then what I'm going to do is once we switch over to</p>
      <p begin="01:00:42.690" end="01:00:47.280">the secondary imaginal of our operations in the secondary you could do wanted-to things you could have a time</p>
      <p begin="01:00:47.280" end="01:00:52.570">...every ten minutes you might want to check of the primaries back-up that require background...look a little bit</p>
      <p begin="01:00:52.570" end="01:00:57.510">mcnally so all I'm doing is every twenty operations I'm going to see if the primaries back-up if it is with</p>
      <p begin="01:00:57.510" end="01:01:02.270">...but to...so again it's basically...events some typing into one is the</p>
      <p begin="01:01:02.270" end="01:01:06.640">trite retrying logic essentially keep...the number of re transitive occured</p>
      <p begin="01:01:06.640" end="01:01:10.110">...threshold...is actually change the and</p>
      <p begin="01:01:10.110" end="01:01:14.330">default request options location mode to secondary whereby all the operations</p>
      <p begin="01:01:14.330" end="01:01:18.940">...the secondary at that point we're going to do is basically every time</p>
      <p begin="01:01:18.940" end="01:01:20.920">an operation succeeds where</p>
      <p begin="01:01:20.920" end="01:01:25.470">we're actually reading from the secondary I'm keeping track of another counter which is where</p>
      <p begin="01:01:25.470" end="01:01:30.930">we basically say if after twenty operations on the secondary and,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:30.930" end="01:01:36.210">then go actually switch back to the primary and hopefully everything's got that I'm</p>
      <p begin="01:01:36.210" end="01:01:40.880">going to run this applications very simple application and all it's doing is basically p indicator</p>
      <p begin="01:01:40.880" end="01:01:45.570">reading for the primary and indicator reading from the secondary now what I'm going to do is going to</p>
      <p begin="01:01:45.570" end="01:01:50.140">fiddler phil has an awesome capability called an auto responder what I've done has built a</p>
      <p begin="01:01:50.140" end="01:01:54.890">...and that allows me to simulate five-three said the era so you can see here</p>

      <p begin="01:01:59.410" end="01:02:03.290">...this basically five-three you can actually see now let me just...</p>
      <p begin="01:02:03.290" end="01:02:09.990">courses application what phyllis doing now is basically intercepting all messages</p>
      <p begin="01:02:09.990" end="01:02:12.550">address tagging this url...sending back a</p>
      <p begin="01:02:12.550" end="01:02:16.990">...message which is something that typically...can do something very difficult</p>
      <p begin="01:02:16.990" end="01:02:21.110">...scenarios to actually simulate but phyllis helping us do that and</p>
      <p begin="01:02:21.110" end="01:02:24.680">...can actually see here basically we've got the red message...basically we</p>
      <p begin="01:02:24.680" end="01:02:29.450">...the request for listening...five-three which point with then got twenty raids that</p>
      <p begin="01:02:29.450" end="01:02:35.490">occur from the secondary is can see that basically...added to the url and,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:35.490" end="01:02:41.250">then we basically try to primate because fiddler was still running we end up going back to the secondary so let's</p>
      <p begin="01:02:41.250" end="01:02:46.140">...continue the applications so continue and go back here you can see here the basically</p>
      <p begin="01:02:46.140" end="01:02:47.650">...reading primary</p>
      <p begin="01:02:47.650" end="01:02:52.640">...the era that's when we switch service secondary if I get to fiddler now basically to say with</p>
      <p begin="01:02:52.640" end="01:02:57.390">the five-three what you see is we come back to the primary so really good example of how</p>
      <p begin="01:02:57.390" end="01:03:02.780">to actually build a highly available application and also how to actually use tools I</p>
