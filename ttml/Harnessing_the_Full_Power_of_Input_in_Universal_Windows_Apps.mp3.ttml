      <p begin="00:00:11.970" end="00:00:16.320">lead program manager on the windows inputs platform team and say we</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:24.550">...about...platform how take full advantage of it in your apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.550" end="00:00:28.940">...been...you to fill out a session evaluation there are</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.940" end="00:00:35.850">prices so please do that another slide...the talk has...can scan.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.850" end="00:00:36.950">...cover for</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.950" end="00:00:41.410">brought areas today the first is universal windows platform and what is the promising</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.410" end="00:00:46.110">...to developers and how that relates to inputs we'll talk next about the</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.110" end="00:00:49.630">input platform at a high-level and talk about the various layers</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.630" end="00:00:52.730">of the platform stack and what's available to you then</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.730" end="00:00:56.560">...jump into some code will get our hands dirty will look at some examples</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.560" end="00:01:02.550">...pointers to other interesting sessions and other resources for you?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:02.550" end="00:01:07.290">So, what is the universal windows platform and what exactly is</p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.290" end="00:01:12.140">it promising developers...two important aspects the first aspect is that the same</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.140" end="00:01:17.130">platforms available...on all devices running windows down and then as was</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.130" end="00:01:21.400">mentioned the keynote this morning the second important aspect is largely due to our windows</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.400" end="00:01:25.340">as a service work...hundreds of millions of machines out there running one-in-ten</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.340" end="00:01:28.990">you can target so put those two things together and you have a huge</p>
      <p begin="00:01:28.990" end="00:01:34.000">...market you can very easily target with your apps?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.000" end="00:01:39.370">So, I really like the slide from the keynote one of the things is great and unique about windows is the breadth of</p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.370" end="00:01:42.700">hardware we support there's a huge number of form factors</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.700" end="00:01:47.720">devices that only run windows from little internet of things devices to</p>
      <p begin="00:01:47.720" end="00:01:52.210">...surface hub holographic devices...columns but from</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.210" end="00:01:56.600">...point of view that means there's a lot of inputs you to think about there's touch</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.600" end="00:01:58.750">...phones and tablets and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.750" end="00:02:02.710">...and surface hub there's...many of the same devices</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.710" end="00:02:08.990">...game controllers there's holographic input me talk about mouse and keyboard.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.990" end="00:02:14.890">how does the input platform help you...the input platforms promises similar to universal windows,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.890" end="00:02:19.310">windows platforms promise and the same input platforms available to on all</p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.310" end="00:02:23.650">of these devices but the corollary that is there's a lot of different inputs that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.650" end="00:02:27.550">your apple be exposed to as it runs on that breath hardware</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.550" end="00:02:32.200">are promise is the input platform makes it easy to handle all these inputs and...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.200" end="00:02:38.520">you build the applicant vision all ad I think the apps that will do best on the store will be the apps</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.520" end="00:02:42.790">that best handle that breadth of hardware that they'll end up running on it's an easy way to differentiate your</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.790" end="00:02:44.630">app from others?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.630" end="00:02:46.700">...quick demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.700" end="00:02:51.510">Let's see the universal platform in action here.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:51.510" end="00:02:55.140">So, I will start actually with the desktop</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.770" end="00:03:01.850">Launch one note here this is the universal at version one of the office teams</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.850" end="00:03:03.360">...a great job building universe</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:08.460">...I think you saw earlier today the excel and powerpoint versions of this is the one</p>
      <p begin="00:03:08.460" end="00:03:12.510">up and input works is you'd expect here I can use the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.510" end="00:03:18.000">mouse I can create a new page and my notes I can type with...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:23.000">keyboard build demo twenty fifteen this is.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.020" end="00:03:30.790">Text I entered on desktop.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.790" end="00:03:32.660">You can use touch if I have a</p>
      <p begin="00:03:32.660" end="00:03:37.420">pen on my surface I can inc address smiley face.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:37.420" end="00:03:39.260">So, input works.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.260" end="00:03:41.180">Very much as you'd expect here but this is universal</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.180" end="00:03:43.300">lap so I can also.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.420" end="00:03:49.760">Run it on the phone.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:03:54.860">So, I've got the same version of one note here on the phone I don't think you need to see my</p>
      <p begin="00:03:54.860" end="00:03:59.760">to do list of you can see that it's...to the page we now have that</p>
      <p begin="00:03:59.760" end="00:04:04.330">page we just created over here on the desktop touch works is using a as use can</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.330" end="00:04:08.840">expect you can pan you consumer content...the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:08.840" end="00:04:11.010">...rendering here I can.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.520" end="00:04:16.860">Double tap syntax I...enter text...but also hooked up a bluetooth</p>
      <p begin="00:04:16.860" end="00:04:22.800">mouse and keyboard let me move that text backer hit tab along so I can</p>
      <p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:31.480">use the mouse and I can select here on the phone.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:31.480" end="00:04:36.470">...new text some entering...the farm using the mouse so universal windows platform</p>
      <p begin="00:04:36.470" end="00:04:41.270">what's you run your app across all these devices the input platforms the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.270" end="00:04:44.170">...platform available in both places here the one</p>
      <p begin="00:04:44.170" end="00:04:48.040">...didn't write any special code for desktop it write a special code for</p>
      <p begin="00:04:48.040" end="00:04:49.750">...code running a and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.750" end="00:04:56.390">as part of this work we brought a bunch of new inputs to devices that didn't happen before.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.390" end="00:05:00.650">Hand as you saw this morning keynote adding a bluetooth keyboard and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:00.650" end="00:05:05.470">mouse to a phone is the first step and participating that continuum experience so-if</p>
      <p begin="00:05:05.470" end="00:05:09.330">identify fun connected it to a display via html by or mirror</p>
      <p begin="00:05:09.330" end="00:05:19.940">cast I can get a pc like experience desktop like experience...just my phone.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:19.940" end="00:05:20.710">What xbox?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:26.550">Some of you is developers the audience may be thinking yourself I know</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.550" end="00:05:31.520">how to write a tablet app I know how to write a phone app what happens when that...goes to an xbox what I do</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:35.450">their or vice...on building a game I know exactly what I want to with</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.450" end="00:05:40.450">comptroller but I don't know-how that's going to translate when I bring it back to a pc or maybe something like</p>
      <p begin="00:05:40.450" end="00:05:45.860">a phone or tablet the universal windows platform this fall will bring the xbox</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.860" end="00:05:48.490">schematic peons to the platform available for</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.490" end="00:05:53.160">your across devices so I think a lot of you probably seen xbox one</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.160" end="00:05:59.060">comptroller and, you used with xbox but how many of you seen a xbox one</p>
      <p begin="00:05:59.060" end="00:06:11.280">controller on a desktop and universal lap.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.280" end="00:06:16.280">So, we took a really simple sample I think many of you...this before this is the direct</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.280" end="00:06:21.150">...first-person shooter samples been around for a while we converted it to be a universal windows</p>
      <p begin="00:06:21.150" end="00:06:25.430">app...five minutes we added...support and suddenly you have an</p>
      <p begin="00:06:25.430" end="00:06:30.070">application ditch will work great on your xbox or create on your pc and,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:30.070" end="00:06:33.470">it's really are universal platform that's going to make handling</p>
      <p begin="00:06:33.470" end="00:06:47.210">comptroller really easily really easy and all your apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:47.210" end="00:06:49.770">...platform so the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.770" end="00:06:54.540">input platform has three we typically think about it and three layers the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.540" end="00:06:57.160">...layer is kind of what you get for free</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57.160" end="00:07:01.680">frameworks controls have a bunch of built-in support whether it's things like input events the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:06.160">frameworks generate for-you for controls state ticker slider text box</p>
      <p begin="00:07:06.160" end="00:07:10.180">...there's a bunch of new controls...as well as much</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.180" end="00:07:14.920">of built-in stuff you get for free the next slayer is really, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.920" end="00:07:18.670">if you need more powered flexibility maybe you're building some custom control that's when he</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.670" end="00:07:23.460">stepped down and use api...like pointer pointer device gesture recognizer things in that</p>
      <p begin="00:07:23.460" end="00:07:26.890">family...give you a lot more our and flexibility</p>
      <p begin="00:07:26.890" end="00:07:31.500">and finally if you need ultimate our you can go down to core input this is about as close to the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:31.500" end="00:07:36.320">metals you can get...talk about this towards the end of the talk but this is where you go if</p>
      <p begin="00:07:36.320" end="00:07:43.090">...other layers aren't giving you exactly the control our flexibility and need.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:43.090" end="00:07:47.300">So, we'll talk about each layer interned I'll start with frameworks controls the frameworks offer</p>
      <p begin="00:07:47.300" end="00:07:51.630">which controls and, the controls all have support for inputs</p>
      <p begin="00:07:51.630" end="00:07:56.230">are built into them already so you can use something like a button with touch with...with</p>
      <p begin="00:07:56.230" end="00:08:01.230">...keyboard all this works is you'd expect if you stick to the built-in controls the frameworks</p>
      <p begin="00:08:01.230" end="00:08:04.630">provider apps just going to work across that broad spectrum of hardware whether</p>
      <p begin="00:08:04.630" end="00:08:11.260">you're running on a phone or on a surface hub your apple just work.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:11.260" end="00:08:16.660">...looking at some code here are pull visual studio up and we'll do a quick.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:16.660" end="00:08:19.690">Example.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:19.690" end="00:08:26.270">Of what you get...controls.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.270" end="00:08:34.340">...so,...sample here.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.340" end="00:08:37.790">I have a really simple sample...on a second it's just</p>
      <p begin="00:08:37.790" end="00:08:42.970">adding three basic controls to my app we've got a button we've got a</p>
      <p begin="00:08:42.970" end="00:08:47.350">...a text box I pick these because a show something interesting about input the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:47.350" end="00:08:52.120">button I can use the mouse always got hooked up to do is change the background</p>
      <p begin="00:08:52.120" end="00:08:57.660">of the application I can click on with the mouse I can use pen and</p>
      <p begin="00:08:57.660" end="00:09:02.140">tap on I can use touch and tap on and if it's got focus I can use</p>
      <p begin="00:09:02.140" end="00:09:07.980">the keyboard and cycle through it so all of these controls right out-of-the-box</p>
      <p begin="00:09:07.980" end="00:09:12.230">...support the inputs you're going to see across are broad spectrum of hardware.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:12.230" end="00:09:14.670">The next control here.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:14.670" end="00:09:18.580">The...hard-to-read...enslavement...the next control here</p>
      <p begin="00:09:18.580" end="00:09:23.200">is a slider and sliders also pretty simple control you can see I move it</p>
      <p begin="00:09:23.200" end="00:09:27.690">...shows me the value and so-call out ...interact with touch the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:27.690" end="00:09:33.360">call out moves sliders a good way to demonstrate that we thought about the interesting aspects of each</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:37.710">input and we've customize the controls to be optimized for those inputs if we had the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.710" end="00:09:42.180">...out with the value in the same place we do for mouse you wouldn't go see it with your finger,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:42.180" end="00:09:43.620">you know, your fingers to large</p>
      <p begin="00:09:43.620" end="00:09:48.910">...you wouldn't see it another thing that's interesting about the slider is that</p>
      <p begin="00:09:48.910" end="00:09:53.630">it uses capture so I can grab the phone here but I can also move my finger off and still</p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.630" end="00:09:58.500">interact with it part of the reason this works is the slider when you successful</p>
      <p begin="00:09:58.500" end="00:10:03.060">...the thumb sets capturing all future input goes to the phone I'll talk about that more and</p>
      <p begin="00:10:03.060" end="00:10:07.880">one of our later examples but it's a helpful tool for you and your building controls.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:07.880" end="00:10:12.840">And, finally we got a text box here text box is built on scroll viewer I'll talk more about school here</p>
      <p begin="00:10:12.840" end="00:10:19.050">...a second it's behaves as you'd expect with touch we've got feedback when you get to the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.050" end="00:10:22.845">andof content...can you</p>
      <p begin="00:10:22.845" end="00:10:29.330">know, select text and...type with the keyboard.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:29.330" end="00:10:32.210">I can use...there, for example, but, we've also,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:32.210" end="00:10:37.150">... this is another control where we've done some interesting differences between the inputs with</p>
      <p begin="00:10:37.150" end="00:10:41.620">mouse you have the traditional...selection model but if I use touch,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:41.620" end="00:10:45.000">for example,you get the grip...you can grab the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:45.000" end="00:10:49.520">...to changer selection so there's a slightly different selection model for touch so for each of our</p>
      <p begin="00:10:49.520" end="00:10:54.510">controls we not only support the impacts that you can expect to see across all the devices</p>
      <p begin="00:10:54.510" end="00:11:01.020">in the broad windows harder spectrum we thought about...the right behavior for all these controls.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:01.020" end="00:11:06.350">Let's look at the sample for this.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:06.350" end="00:11:09.670">The interesting...animal.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:09.670" end="00:11:15.610">Is these three?</p>
      <p begin="00:11:15.610" end="00:11:19.960">...have a button that we're putting in there we have a slider control...text box there's</p>
      <p begin="00:11:19.960" end="00:11:24.770">nothing particularly interesting we're doing here if we look at the backing csharp.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:24.770" end="00:11:26.230">Other than.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:26.230" end="00:11:30.090">Just spinning in a for...adding syntax...the text box there really isn't a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:11:30.090" end="00:11:34.550">were doing the button has some code you just randomly set of background color but this is, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:34.550" end="00:11:39.120">this is all functionality get other box we haven't written a bunch of code for penn, for example, make-work...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:39.120" end="00:11:45.420">scenes but speaking of penn what's ad inc supports really quickly to</p>
      <p begin="00:11:45.420" end="00:11:50.370">our application and uncommon some code here and adding canvas</p>
      <p begin="00:11:50.370" end="00:11:55.270">so in canvas is one of the new controls were offering and ten it adds...to</p>
      <p begin="00:11:55.270" end="00:11:59.710">...lap the canvas will expand...parent tolerances so I've just</p>
      <p begin="00:11:59.710" end="00:12:06.450">put it in a grid here and given it a heighten width so it doesn't take up the entiresurface of the sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:06.450" end="00:12:10.030">And, in our backing csharp.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.030" end="00:12:12.970">Some comments and code the default behavior</p>
      <p begin="00:12:12.970" end="00:12:17.350">...canvas is that it collects...from penn but I want to also collect</p>
      <p begin="00:12:17.350" end="00:12:20.910">...so I can set on the in canvases</p>
      <p begin="00:12:20.910" end="00:12:26.260">in presenter the input devices types property I can set it to capture not just</p>
      <p begin="00:12:26.260" end="00:12:29.910">...but also touch.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:29.910" end="00:12:38.030">So, let's compile run that and I'll show you what you get within canvas.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:38.030" end="00:12:39.780">And, go back to our control sample and now we</p>
      <p begin="00:12:39.780" end="00:12:45.120">...canvas at the bottom I can use my pen and I can...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:45.120" end="00:12:48.470">you get such a beautiful and here I can use touch</p>
      <p begin="00:12:48.470" end="00:12:51.530">I can include as well you can turn on mao sinking if you want</p>
      <p begin="00:12:51.530" end="00:12:56.620">to so in canvas gives you a lot of functionality the box it's really easy to add your application</p>
      <p begin="00:12:56.620" end="00:13:00.250">...features around beautiful fining can cleaning it up so it's not just, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:00.250" end="00:13:04.870">raw points connected with straight lines there is reco features</p>
      <p begin="00:13:04.870" end="00:13:09.090">you can get access to it supports input from a variety of different</p>
      <p begin="00:13:09.090" end="00:13:11.490">input types like mouse and, pen</p>
      <p begin="00:13:11.490" end="00:13:20.280">and touch and we have a couple talks will go into much more depth about inc that you should see tomorrow.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:20.280" end="00:13:26.450">Samoa...dec here.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:26.450" end="00:13:31.370">So, there's lots of you...for free with the frameworks but sometimes you need more than what they give you</p>
      <p begin="00:13:31.370" end="00:13:34.750">an...classes of things usually...here for the first is</p>
      <p begin="00:13:34.750" end="00:13:39.500">...controls are customizable I'll talk about scroll...or school...important control but it's...</p>
      <p begin="00:13:39.500" end="00:13:44.360">as an example because it also offers a lot of customization and also talk about</p>
      <p begin="00:13:44.360" end="00:13:51.090">the input events and the gesture events you can get from the frameworks and what you can do with those?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:51.090" end="00:13:54.460">So, scroll viewer is an interesting control we looked at</p>
      <p begin="00:13:54.460" end="00:13:58.500">the top apps on the store and eighty percent of them</p>
      <p begin="00:13:58.500" end="00:14:02.260">...scroll viewers...apron of the sam lapses a scroll viewer in their</p>
      <p begin="00:14:02.260" end="00:14:06.220">code somewhere which is really high number and when you consider scroll</p>
      <p begin="00:14:06.220" end="00:14:09.960">...also powers a number of other controls like grid view unless you</p>
      <p begin="00:14:09.960" end="00:14:15.100">...foot view and text box when you expanse that entire family of controls either user</p>
      <p begin="00:14:15.100" end="00:14:19.870">...powered by...the number jump to ninety percent of the top...are using it somewhere in their</p>
      <p begin="00:14:19.870" end="00:14:24.720">code which is which is huge the remaining ten percent are things like games or other</p>
      <p begin="00:14:24.720" end="00:14:28.480">apps don't even use this animal controls so basically all of the top</p>
      <p begin="00:14:28.480" end="00:14:33.760">sam lapse that are using the controls using scroll viewer and one way shape or form so it's definitely a powerful</p>
      <p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:37.840">...certainly popular part of the reasons popular is</p>
      <p begin="00:14:37.840" end="00:14:42.410">panning is such a core part of our interaction language...you're on a phone you</p>
      <p begin="00:14:42.410" end="00:14:46.420">...small-screen you panther content a lot of our controls like pivot</p>
      <p begin="00:14:46.420" end="00:14:49.400">and hub are built on panning behaviors</p>
      <p begin="00:14:49.400" end="00:14:52.760">...here gets used in a lot of places and, it's</p>
      <p begin="00:14:52.760" end="00:14:56.140">...just offers you a way to have a lot of content</p>
      <p begin="00:14:56.140" end="00:15:00.960">and a small space in your app and sort of panned through...right but you can also do other things you can turn</p>
      <p begin="00:15:00.960" end="00:15:04.240">on support presume you can turn inertia on or off</p>
      <p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:08.960">other snap points so you can if you have...on and somebody pans within a</p>
      <p begin="00:15:08.960" end="00:15:14.390">...generator...points will ensure that you and illogical boundary and content</p>
      <p begin="00:15:14.390" end="00:15:20.960">...so things like rails and sat points resume and other things like that you can turn on as well?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:20.960" end="00:15:32.630">So, let's look a little bit of code here and a sample using scroll viewer.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:32.630" end="00:15:37.280">So, we have a real simple sample here there's a bunch of toggle goals and drop down</p>
      <p begin="00:15:37.280" end="00:15:41.700">that control some behaviors behind-the-scenes but the...itself is this set</p>
      <p begin="00:15:41.700" end="00:15:46.700">of rectangles we've just stuffed a stack panel...the school viewer...stockpile has a bunch of racks and the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:46.700" end="00:15:52.680">...of different colors so I can panned through these by default you can see that</p>
      <p begin="00:15:52.680" end="00:15:56.870">...get inertia panning for free I haven't I haven't touched anything here yet I notice</p>
      <p begin="00:15:56.870" end="00:15:59.290">...scroll bar on the side the scroll</p>
      <p begin="00:15:59.290" end="00:16:03.880">bar with touch since panning such an easy thing to do with touch we don't really expected use</p>
      <p begin="00:16:03.880" end="00:16:09.540">escobar scroll bars really more of just a visual telling you where you are in your content but,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:09.540" end="00:16:14.420">if I use mouse and bring it over here you'll see that we get a traditional scroll bar</p>
      <p begin="00:16:14.420" end="00:16:16.130">...another example of how we sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:16:16.130" end="00:16:21.110">optimize the controls for each of the inputs you might be interacting with them.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:21.110" end="00:16:22.930">I can do things here like turnoff</p>
      <p begin="00:16:22.930" end="00:16:26.490">...so if I turn off inertia obviously it doesn't have inertial</p>
      <p begin="00:16:26.490" end="00:16:29.530">and I pam I can turn on zoom and you can do</p>
      <p begin="00:16:29.530" end="00:16:34.700">some like zoom out on the stack panel and see all...here we</p>
      <p begin="00:16:34.700" end="00:16:39.670">...way back in if we want all this is powered by the great pan zoom</p>
      <p begin="00:16:39.670" end="00:16:45.080">behavior you get from direct manipulation behind-the-scenes the frameworks take care of this for you.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:45.080" end="00:16:49.020">So, you can also turn on snap points so when I panda content</p>
      <p begin="00:16:49.020" end="00:16:53.240">it doesn't necessarily snap to any content boundary but,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:53.240" end="00:16:57.410">if I turn on optional snap points when I pan you'll see that we</p>
      <p begin="00:16:57.410" end="00:17:02.250">adjust inertia curve to ensure that you always land right on the edge of</p>
      <p begin="00:17:02.250" end="00:17:07.100">well most of the time you land on the edge of a content boundary the optional ones don't force you</p>
      <p begin="00:17:07.100" end="00:17:11.700">to...if it would be too much of change like, for example, when I panned like that it's not going to</p>
      <p begin="00:17:11.700" end="00:17:16.590">snap made anything but if we have a little more velocity it makes it pretty easy to just tweak the curve a little bit</p>
      <p begin="00:17:16.590" end="00:17:21.470">and sure you and on a logical content boundary if you move to something like mandatory snot</p>
      <p begin="00:17:21.470" end="00:17:26.920">points I can't leave the stack panel here and have it not</p>
      <p begin="00:17:26.920" end="00:17:31.450">...snap to a content boundary so mandatory will force you to</p>
      <p begin="00:17:31.450" end="00:17:35.290">...something this is really good for control like...view like if you have a control where</p>
      <p begin="00:17:35.290" end="00:17:39.700">...flipping through photos you probably don't want to leave the user...a space where about half of one for</p>
      <p begin="00:17:39.700" end="00:17:43.510">...and half another that'd be great place to use mandatory snap points but if</p>
      <p begin="00:17:43.510" end="00:17:48.230">you're building something like excel or maybe a list...you've got a list of</p>
      <p begin="00:17:48.230" end="00:17:52.770">...maybe it's not quite as important that you always snap to a content boundary could</p>
      <p begin="00:17:52.770" end="00:17:58.860">...optional...points and then it would look very natural for the user when it does snap?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:58.860" end="00:18:10.480">So, let's look at the code here.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:15.660">So, the demo for this is real simple ...just look at the code so when we</p>
      <p begin="00:18:15.660" end="00:18:20.600">toggle inertia all we're doing behind-the-scenes with the school fewer</p>
      <p begin="00:18:20.600" end="00:18:26.670">is toggle in this property is scroll inertia enabled real simple to turn</p>
      <p begin="00:18:26.670" end="00:18:31.790">inertia on often your...there's also a zoom inertia so maybe you have a map and</p>
      <p begin="00:18:31.790" end="00:18:35.890">it's panel in two dimensions you can zoom monitors well maybe you want or</p>
      <p begin="00:18:35.890" end="00:18:38.230">...resume there and let users, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:38.230" end="00:18:42.780">maybe on smaller...what's kind of a pain to sort of repeatedly zoom you could turn</p>
      <p begin="00:18:42.780" end="00:18:46.800">...should make it easier to make large...zoom factor when.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:48.030" end="00:18:49.540">Resuming the toggle</p>
      <p begin="00:18:49.540" end="00:18:54.130">...turn it on off just changes the zoom mode property so there's a scene am zoom...you can</p>
      <p begin="00:18:54.130" end="00:18:56.260">...to enabled disabled really straightforward.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:57.570" end="00:19:01.270">Snap points.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:01.270" end="00:19:05.940">We have a little switch statement down here that looks at whatever the value of the drop down</p>
      <p begin="00:19:05.940" end="00:19:08.870">as...the vertical snap point type.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:08.870" end="00:19:10.200">There's a number of properties for</p>
      <p begin="00:19:10.200" end="00:19:14.480">...points there's a whole set of properties for horizontal snot points as a whole set of properties for vertical</p>
      <p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:18.740">...points you can do things like set the type there's mandatory this optional you can turn</p>
      <p begin="00:19:18.740" end="00:19:22.900">them off there are properties for alignment</p>
      <p begin="00:19:22.900" end="00:19:26.610">thank you probably noticed in the sample it was always snapping to the top of the</p>
      <p begin="00:19:26.610" end="00:19:31.540">racks you can have it snap to the bottom of your elements for the center of your elements if you want you</p>
      <p begin="00:19:31.540" end="00:19:37.200">can change the alignment there's also...points that you can control and other things you can sudden</p>
      <p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:41.470">in school...as well...rails other behaviors that are customizable rails</p>
      <p begin="00:19:41.470" end="00:19:46.450">are useful for cases maybe you've got some to dependable content but most of the time</p>
      <p begin="00:19:46.450" end="00:19:50.260">users panned vertically with it and you want to clean-up sort of sloppy</p>
      <p begin="00:19:50.260" end="00:19:55.760">vertical pans into something that really is access aligned that's a great place to turn on rails so</p>
      <p begin="00:19:55.760" end="00:19:59.950">...viewers really customizable and gives you a lot of options...really easy to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:59.950" end="00:20:04.850">use is really just changing a couple properties on it and sticking...content and it and you get, you know,</p>

      <p begin="00:20:15.590" end="00:20:19.660">...patrols the other thing that you can do with the frameworks pretty easily is</p>
      <p begin="00:20:19.660" end="00:20:22.560">respond input events and...a couple classes of these</p>
      <p begin="00:20:22.560" end="00:20:25.890">...raw planar events I think a lot of you're familiar with planar they</p>
      <p begin="00:20:25.890" end="00:20:32.140">let you do things like telephone planar comes down on ui element and sandler</p>
      <p begin="00:20:32.140" end="00:20:35.160">...web app and you could use it maybe building</p>
      <p begin="00:20:35.160" end="00:20:40.140">...some custom control that has button like feedback you could use the pointer down and,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:40.140" end="00:20:44.710">up events to simulate press feedback on the button there's also enter and exit events that would let</p>
      <p begin="00:20:44.710" end="00:20:47.110">you simulate things like hover so if you want</p>
      <p begin="00:20:47.110" end="00:20:51.130">...bring a mouse or a pen over a control</p>
      <p begin="00:20:51.130" end="00:20:55.820">...have some hover feedback...tool to pops up you can do that with the pointer events</p>
      <p begin="00:20:55.820" end="00:21:00.230">...also gesture events and...provides us relatively rich</p>

      <p begin="00:21:05.720" end="00:21:10.690">to and with these you can respond to a lot of the standard gestures ec and windows</p>
      <p begin="00:21:10.690" end="00:21:16.180">...double tap have a right click event we'll talk about a second.</p>

      <p begin="00:21:25.340" end="00:21:30.190">Are code here so again another super simple sample from this animal point of view we've</p>
      <p begin="00:21:30.190" end="00:21:34.380">got four racks and each of them handles different events so this top most</p>

      <p begin="00:22:45.250" end="00:22:53.820">event for you so very simple...the code here?</p>
      <p begin="00:22:53.820" end="00:22:59.310">So, we set up our sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:59.310" end="00:23:05.520">She can get rid of...what...</p>
      <p begin="00:23:05.520" end="00:23:10.510">We...sample with a couple...handlers the first pair are the preston released chandler see-saw</p>
      <p begin="00:23:10.510" end="00:23:15.270">at first box...pointer comes down or up those events get triggered the next pair are entering</p>
      <p begin="00:23:15.270" end="00:23:20.250">exits when a pointer comes over some content you'll see these.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:20.250" end="00:23:25.260">For the gesture hammers were listening to...double tap right tap which is that</p>
      <p begin="00:23:25.260" end="00:23:29.890">meta event that sort of roles all the right click events together and holding we'll talk about holding</p>
      <p begin="00:23:29.890" end="00:23:35.740">a second most of the handlers in the sample are real simple to just changing the background color</p>
      <p begin="00:23:35.740" end="00:23:40.700">of direct that they were in so not much to talk about there but</p>
      <p begin="00:23:40.700" end="00:23:46.060">when we get down to holding its own marketing holding is an event that has a couple different states so if you're doing</p>
      <p begin="00:23:46.060" end="00:23:50.630">...with touch...basically three things that can happen</p>
      <p begin="00:23:50.630" end="00:23:55.760">you figure comes down if you wait long enough you eventually get a holdings start</p>
      <p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:24:00.480">we don't want slow taps or the user just brushes the screen to structuring</p>
      <p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:04.020">...holds the sometime threshold after pass before.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:04.020" end="00:24:08.590">Will allow you to be a person hold state once you've crossed the holding state then</p>
      <p begin="00:24:08.590" end="00:24:13.700">one or two things can happen...successfully complete the...holder you could drag away and, then the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:13.700" end="00:24:18.900">whole gets canceled so in the whole cancel case you'd see a holed cancelevent</p>

      <p begin="00:24:24.240" end="00:24:28.880">successfully holding status completed if we go back to the app and I</p>
      <p begin="00:24:28.880" end="00:24:35.870">...hold you can see that after a person hold on it we get the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:35.870" end="00:24:40.610">holed start events and we update the text...the color for holding and if I drag away we got a whole</p>

      <p begin="00:24:44.850" end="00:24:49.540">...touch you'll see that it generates both a holed complete...right...</p>
      <p begin="00:24:49.540" end="00:24:54.530">event immediately afterwards and the right...comes in so fast you can't see the...saying that</p>
      <p begin="00:24:54.530" end="00:25:03.780">...completed their so handling these basic input events is really simple as well?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:03.780" end="00:25:07.870">So, what happens when you need a little more our flexibility if what's built</p>
      <p begin="00:25:07.870" end="00:25:11.140">into the frameworks isn't what you need where do you go so?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.380" end="00:25:12.710">This is</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.710" end="00:25:18.790">...of second layer and platform...I talk about these are sort of lower-level api to</p>
      <p begin="00:25:18.790" end="00:25:22.200">give you more control over the raw data and gesture detection</p>
      <p begin="00:25:22.200" end="00:25:26.940">and other things like that so these are really good for building custom controls or experience</p>
      <p begin="00:25:26.940" end="00:25:33.960">...go beyond what you get for free.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:33.960" end="00:25:38.950">So, first thing to talk about our the...api the pointer api is I think most of you have use</p>
      <p begin="00:25:38.950" end="00:25:43.040">these before they abstract touch and...mouse together all of our pointing types may</p>
      <p begin="00:25:43.040" end="00:25:47.160">be future inputs into one coherent api surface</p>
      <p begin="00:25:47.160" end="00:25:51.420">that api surface makes it really easy for you to get common properties that all of these</p>
      <p begin="00:25:51.420" end="00:25:54.890">pointer type share things like the position of...pointer the idea of a</p>
      <p begin="00:25:54.890" end="00:26:00.410">pointer a handle back to the device the type of it but you can also if you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:00.410" end="00:26:04.840">you can go and grab off the property bag on the planar you can get input specific</p>
      <p begin="00:26:04.840" end="00:26:09.460">typed data so...have things like pressure you can figure out how hard the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:09.460" end="00:26:12.720">users pressing something like touch has a contact</p>
      <p begin="00:26:12.720" end="00:26:17.230">...we know the bounding box around the fingers you can make some decisions based on the contact</p>
      <p begin="00:26:17.230" end="00:26:20.900">wrecked mouse has buttons and we'll state and things</p>
      <p begin="00:26:20.900" end="00:26:24.810">like that so pointers relation api</p>
      <p begin="00:26:24.810" end="00:26:29.330">will show you this I don't know-how many of you follow web standard discussions but</p>
      <p begin="00:26:29.330" end="00:26:33.810">wthree-c just ratified...web version of planar as a new standard so we're</p>
      <p begin="00:26:33.810" end="00:26:39.260">super excited about that we worked with firefox google a bunch of folks in the web community</p>
      <p begin="00:26:39.260" end="00:26:44.720">to iterate on the standard make it better over the last year-and-a-half and just two months ago</p>
      <p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:47.680">...accepted as a standard so we're very excited about that firefox</p>
      <p begin="00:26:47.680" end="00:26:52.720">has a implementation right now google's working implantation obviously ie and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:52.720" end="00:26:56.480">...both have implementations of the new pointer standard to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:27:00.770">...web apps or your webpages directly.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:00.770" end="00:27:02.800">So, what's the code.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:02.800" end="00:27:04.950">And,...see pointers expression in.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:06.230" end="00:27:10.090">The universe...</p>
      <p begin="00:27:10.090" end="00:27:20.120">So,...should sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:20.120" end="00:27:23.870">Our sample here there's a couple things so we set up a couple</p>
      <p begin="00:27:23.870" end="00:27:26.540">dictionaries basically to track.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:26.540" end="00:27:34.030">The contacts andlet me show you the sample for talk about code.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:34.030" end="00:27:36.870">So, we...sample here that.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:36.870" end="00:27:41.700">Does a couple things when I put any pointer down it basically gives us debug spew about the</p>
      <p begin="00:27:41.700" end="00:27:46.200">pointer you can see in the black section of the top a bunch of common data if I</p>
      <p begin="00:27:46.200" end="00:27:50.460">put a touchdown you can see that the common data remains the same</p>
      <p begin="00:27:50.460" end="00:27:55.250">we're showing you id position contact...other common properties but,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:55.250" end="00:27:58.660">then in different colors below you can see some input</p>
      <p begin="00:27:58.660" end="00:28:03.650">type specific data so if I go back to mouse it shows us the button state right now pulling</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.650" end="00:28:07.950">down the left button if I hold on the right button...can see that here</p>
      <p begin="00:28:07.950" end="00:28:12.240">...like touch you can see that the id for all these contacts are</p>
      <p begin="00:28:12.240" end="00:28:18.780">different we can track all of these things we talked before about contact...so I put my</p>
      <p begin="00:28:18.780" end="00:28:22.700">fun down and if my...mostly perpendicular to the screen you can see that</p>
      <p begin="00:28:22.700" end="00:28:26.780">direct is you know, more or less square right it's sort of, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:26.780" end="00:28:30.950">ninety by seventy profess start flattening my thumb ouch?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:30.950" end="00:28:34.530">You can see you should see.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:34.530" end="00:28:37.370">That the width.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:37.370" end="00:28:40.640">Sorry the height gets larger</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.640" end="00:28:45.530">so sometimes hardware detects contact...some doesn't when I</p>
      <p begin="00:28:45.530" end="00:28:49.660">single-point api stews you can tell if the hardware is give you that information very easily you</p>
      <p begin="00:28:49.660" end="00:28:54.470">can query and say hey do supports contact direct you can find out for things like</p>
      <p begin="00:28:54.470" end="00:29:00.190">penn we have a bunch of button state so I can press the barrow button I can press</p>
      <p begin="00:29:00.190" end="00:29:05.020">the racer and I can work with pressure here so I can max out the pressure</p>
      <p begin="00:29:05.020" end="00:29:06.690">or press very lightly.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:07.700" end="00:29:11.320">So, if you want to get to that rich input specific data like maybe</p>
      <p begin="00:29:11.320" end="00:29:16.080">you're one node and you want to do something special with panned where you vary the thickness of your</p>
      <p begin="00:29:16.080" end="00:29:20.440">...you can get to that data and make those kinds of decisions</p>
      <p begin="00:29:20.440" end="00:29:26.830">and your app so now let's look at the code.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:26.830" end="00:29:32.160">...real simple it's just a blank page behind-the-scenes we have a couple</p>
      <p begin="00:29:32.160" end="00:29:36.130">dictionaries for tracking those ui pops that we create but,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:36.130" end="00:29:41.150">the real magic is listening to these pointer events</p>
      <p begin="00:29:41.150" end="00:29:43.960">...for point oppressed move to released and</p>
      <p begin="00:29:43.960" end="00:29:49.250">...changes and then the handles for these do a little bit of</p>
      <p begin="00:29:49.250" end="00:29:54.380">work like tracking the point but they really just create those property pops</p>
      <p begin="00:29:54.380" end="00:30:00.890">...you saw following the different events so for</p>
      <p begin="00:30:00.890" end="00:30:09.020">point oppressed we create the property pop up here for poynter move we</p>
      <p begin="00:30:09.020" end="00:30:14.010">for...released we clean-up after ourselves what does it look like getting those property</p>
      <p begin="00:30:14.010" end="00:30:17.920">...what we do two things we wonget the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:17.920" end="00:30:21.710">...properties and then we also check if there's device specific properties for that</p>
      <p begin="00:30:21.710" end="00:30:25.870">input type common properties are relatively easy to get these are all the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:25.870" end="00:30:29.090">sort of first-class properties hanging off the pointer...there's things like</p>
      <p begin="00:30:29.090" end="00:30:33.440">pointer id there's a point that represents the position you can get the x and y</p>
      <p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:38.390">...you can get whether it's in contact or not you can check the...you can get a handle back to the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:38.390" end="00:30:42.350">pointer device and do things with the device...as a number of things all</p>
      <p begin="00:30:42.350" end="00:30:47.210">...share and we point some of out here and then we look at</p>
      <p begin="00:30:47.210" end="00:30:50.930">the type of the...so checking...it...as</p>
      <p begin="00:30:50.930" end="00:30:55.520">...touch and then we go and look for some property specific to those so</p>
      <p begin="00:30:55.520" end="00:31:00.330">in mouse, for example, the first thing we do is get the property bag so each pointer</p>
      <p begin="00:31:00.330" end="00:31:05.010">points has a properties property that is a property bag and it has all the rich</p>
      <p begin="00:31:05.010" end="00:31:09.270">type specific data in it so the grab that property bag and then</p>
      <p begin="00:31:09.270" end="00:31:14.490">from it we can get things like the button states whether somebody's generating a mouse</p>
      <p begin="00:31:14.490" end="00:31:17.250">...if we look at hatch touch?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:18.480" end="00:31:23.970">You can see we can get things like the contact racks the contact tight.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:23.970" end="00:31:28.270">There's some to models for working with the stuff one is you can ask the hardware</p>
      <p begin="00:31:28.270" end="00:31:31.200">...support pressure because, you know, theoretically</p>
      <p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:36.070">attach device could support pressure doesn't have to be a pen so you could ask the hardware and say</p>
      <p begin="00:31:36.070" end="00:31:40.660">do you support share pressure whatever property alternatively all</p>
      <p begin="00:31:40.660" end="00:31:45.480">these properties sort of have smart defaults to and you can just use pressure directly</p>
      <p begin="00:31:45.480" end="00:31:50.020">...application and if it's a input that doesn't support it you'll get some default value like</p>
      <p begin="00:31:50.020" end="00:31:54.050">a median pressure or if you want to use contact wrecked and your</p>
      <p begin="00:31:54.050" end="00:31:58.780">app even just code against it and the contact will be zero for hardware doesn't support it and it will</p>
      <p begin="00:31:58.780" end="00:32:03.460">have some nonzero value for hardware that does support so a lot of these properties are smart</p>
      <p begin="00:32:03.460" end="00:32:11.540">behind-the-scenes and make it easy says...a bunch of if this property exist...my hardware do xyz.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:11.540" end="00:32:18.980">So, pointers relatively simple to work with.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:18.980" end="00:32:24.600">...players good for things like building a paint apple they problem user</p>
      <p begin="00:32:24.600" end="00:32:28.660">...king api for that maybe you're building custom control, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:28.660" end="00:32:32.790">if you're if you're rebuilding button for some reason you use raw pointer events but</p>
      <p begin="00:32:32.790" end="00:32:37.680">a lot of cases you want gestures right if you're trying to rebuild something like scroll of your you'd want to detect</p>
      <p begin="00:32:37.680" end="00:32:39.600">...launched zooms.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:39.600" end="00:32:43.640">Maybe you have some nip your bowl object in your application like a</p>

      <p begin="00:33:59.780" end="00:34:03.180">And, actually before we look at the code let's talk about what zambia gives you</p>
      <p begin="00:34:03.180" end="00:34:07.440">hear so we'll services annals sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:07.440" end="00:34:10.160">This is real simple we've got some ui that toggle</p>

      <p begin="00:34:20.140" end="00:34:26.310">for off-screen and, we've also done some things to control how gesture detection</p>
      <p begin="00:34:26.310" end="00:34:31.150">works here we can constrain the element...</p>

      <p begin="00:34:42.060" end="00:34:46.200">this is all built on stuff that example gives you today so let's look at the code for that</p>
      <p begin="00:34:46.200" end="00:34:53.780">and then we'll take a look at just recognizer how to build the same experience with that?</p>
      <p begin="00:34:53.780" end="00:34:58.760">So, we're talking about the input events available to the in something example you can listen</p>
      <p begin="00:34:58.760" end="00:35:02.960">to more than just happen double tap and right click that we showed the first example you</p>
      <p begin="00:35:02.960" end="00:35:07.700">...listen to richer gesture events like manipulations so that's what we</p>
      <p begin="00:35:07.700" end="00:35:10.240">fucked up here the sample simple just a</p>
      <p begin="00:35:10.240" end="00:35:15.310">...and we're going to set a couple handlers on it so we do</p>
      <p begin="00:35:15.310" end="00:35:18.490">some initialization we set up our transforms.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:18.490" end="00:35:20.080">But, then.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:20.080" end="00:35:23.390">We go and listen to for different manipulation events</p>
      <p begin="00:35:23.390" end="00:35:28.800">so manipulation started fires when you start a...zoom or rotator something like</p>
      <p begin="00:35:28.800" end="00:35:32.890">that manipulation delta fires during the progression of your events while the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:32.890" end="00:35:37.840">users panning you're going to get started and...a bunch of deltas...tracking how far they've moved you have</p>
      <p begin="00:35:37.840" end="00:35:41.480">...completed when all the fingers come up in the manipulation...</p>
      <p begin="00:35:41.480" end="00:35:47.970">inertia design you can also see...manipulation inertia starting event that tells you that...begun.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:47.970" end="00:35:53.290">then manipulate me here is just the name of our ...and the sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:53.290" end="00:35:55.660">Ui elements and sample have a manipulation</p>
      <p begin="00:35:55.660" end="00:35:59.890">mode property on them and here we're configuring it to allow for translation</p>
      <p begin="00:35:59.890" end="00:36:03.640">...the x axis translation the y axis and rotation and we set</p>
      <p begin="00:36:03.640" end="00:36:08.610">up inertia for both of these things so we just or all those together and stick it in this manipulation</p>
      <p begin="00:36:08.610" end="00:36:13.630">mode and now you will start getting manipulation events when you interact with</p>
      <p begin="00:36:13.630" end="00:36:17.700">that ui element so relatively simple the transform stuff that we</p>
      <p begin="00:36:17.700" end="00:36:22.190">set up we initially set...to the identity transform but as we listen</p>
      <p begin="00:36:22.190" end="00:36:28.230">to those manipulation events will be updating the transform the</p>
      <p begin="00:36:28.230" end="00:36:32.150">...transform on that...general start showing up and handling input</p>
      <p begin="00:36:32.150" end="00:36:37.950">in different spots based on the transform so manipulation started?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:37.950" end="00:36:42.800">We're just changing the color of the...to let, you know, you're interacting with it if you remember the sample turns blue when you</p>
      <p begin="00:36:44.050" end="00:36:49.040">...a lot of the real work happens and manipulation delta.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:49.040" end="00:36:54.290">the first thing we do is we save the old transform because what we get</p>
      <p begin="00:36:54.290" end="00:36:58.280">manipulation delta is the new components for</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.280" end="00:37:03.500">translations scale changes and rotation changes it's not accumulative one</p>
      <p begin="00:37:03.500" end="00:37:07.400">there is a cumulative event that you can get to but are just handling</p>
      <p begin="00:37:07.400" end="00:37:11.730">deltas here so the first-order businesses to calculate the center of</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.730" end="00:37:16.150">that interaction if we go back to the sample for a second, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:16.150" end="00:37:20.930">I don't always want to just rotate around the center of the...sometimes on a rotate around a</p>
      <p begin="00:37:20.930" end="00:37:25.590">point like if I grab a corner...I want to build...have that sort of natural interaction file</p>
      <p begin="00:37:25.590" end="00:37:29.990">and rotate...and rotating around this corner and not the center of</p>
      <p begin="00:37:29.990" end="00:37:34.090">the element so we figure out what the center of</p>
      <p begin="00:37:34.090" end="00:37:41.340">the manipulation event that's coming to us is we save that and then we take the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:42.490" end="00:37:47.460">delta coming off...and apply it to our rotation component of our transform</p>
      <p begin="00:37:47.460" end="00:37:51.930">and we take the x and y translation of events the information and them and apply</p>
      <p begin="00:37:51.930" end="00:37:56.860">...xy translation...delta transform this then gets applied to the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:56.860" end="00:38:03.070">...and suddenly example now...new position when inertia starts and when</p>
      <p begin="00:38:03.070" end="00:38:08.250">...completes...change the color again so real simple handlers there so,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:08.250" end="00:38:10.720">the meat of what's happening here and sample is pretty</p>
      <p begin="00:38:10.720" end="00:38:15.700">straightforward you set manipulation mode on the ui element the want to build interact with, you know, whether it's that</p>
      <p begin="00:38:15.700" end="00:38:20.310">...moving around or maybe of a pain that you want pull down you it's just</p>
      <p begin="00:38:20.310" end="00:38:24.680">...why translation or something like that and then you add some of</p>
      <p begin="00:38:24.680" end="00:38:29.380">...you start getting your events and you can calculate a new transformed apply to</p>
      <p begin="00:38:29.380" end="00:38:34.020">that element if we want to look at how we did things like</p>
      <p begin="00:38:34.020" end="00:38:38.910">...to a specific access were just x sorry...your translation</p>
      <p begin="00:38:38.910" end="00:38:43.760">in the y axis...x axis of I want to lock it to the horizontal axis we</p>
      <p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:49.360">...translation why really straightforward you can just change the manipulation mode?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:49.360" end="00:38:51.500">For...for</p>
      <p begin="00:38:51.500" end="00:38:55.550">inertia we just turn off the.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:38:59.920">Scroll oversee can see this we turn off the translation inertia</p>
      <p begin="00:38:59.920" end="00:39:02.640">...rotation...again just manipulating the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:02.640" end="00:39:07.540">manipulation mode property so very straightforward to do this now let's look</p>
      <p begin="00:39:07.540" end="00:39:12.360">at gesture recognizer so we've rebuilt the same sample shush recognizer</p>
      <p begin="00:39:12.360" end="00:39:17.420">to highlight how if you are using just recognizer some of the differences from doing this in</p>
      <p begin="00:39:17.420" end="00:39:22.480">a framework so it behaves the same way you can translate you can rotate it we can</p>
      <p begin="00:39:22.480" end="00:39:28.440">...axes but the codes a little bit different and the main thing that's different</p>
      <p begin="00:39:28.440" end="00:39:33.190">about the code is that the model for just recognizer is that you receive raw</p>
      <p begin="00:39:33.190" end="00:39:36.060">pointer events and then you take...pointer events and you shovel</p>
      <p begin="00:39:36.060" end="00:39:40.810">in the gesture recognizer and it coughs out events for-you you'll see that the manipulation</p>
      <p begin="00:39:40.810" end="00:39:44.140">...recognizer generates are very similar to what you get from sample the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:44.140" end="00:39:48.260">pointer events will be obviously recognizable you configure just...the same</p>
      <p begin="00:39:48.260" end="00:39:51.980">...the main difference from something like this animal sample showed you is that</p>
      <p begin="00:39:51.980" end="00:39:56.220">your manually feeding the gesture recognizer now gives you a lot of our to you could have a bunch of</p>
      <p begin="00:39:56.220" end="00:40:00.860">just recognizers and feed them often the same input or you can decide which inputs go-to gesture</p>
      <p begin="00:40:00.860" end="00:40:05.510">...maybe you don't want to manipulate the...with planar data</p>
      <p begin="00:40:05.510" end="00:40:09.900">sr with...data and you could look at the type of the pointed and choose to feed it or not</p>
      <p begin="00:40:09.900" end="00:40:13.370">...just recognizer having access to the component gives you more flexibility</p>
      <p begin="00:40:14.850" end="00:40:17.290">so we set up the sample the same way</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.290" end="00:40:24.130">we the only new thing is that we're creating a windows...you wide-eyed input gesture.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:24.130" end="00:40:28.000">And, we have a little helper class down here manipulation input processor will show</p>
      <p begin="00:40:28.000" end="00:40:31.620">in a second the code to the set</p>
      <p begin="00:40:31.620" end="00:40:33.280">are transforms and</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.350" end="00:40:40.860">...these axes is pretty much the same source look at how we're setting up.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:40.860" end="00:40:45.450">This helper classmate...so we've</p>
      <p begin="00:40:45.450" end="00:40:50.430">...a couple things we can adjust recognizer hand in the element that we want to manipulate and we hand</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.430" end="00:40:55.900">and something that's our frame of reference which in this case is sort of apparent most element.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:55.900" end="00:41:01.100">We...gesture recognizer and generate some settings if we go look</p>
      <p begin="00:41:01.100" end="00:41:07.890">at what we're doing with gesture settings here you'll see it looks a lot like the sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:07.890" end="00:41:12.820">Area looks...so we're setting x translation</p>
      <p begin="00:41:12.820" end="00:41:17.350">why translation rotation...both of these things we stick it in the gesture settings properties</p>
      <p begin="00:41:17.350" end="00:41:21.820">...configure at the same way you configures animals manipulations</p>
      <p begin="00:41:21.820" end="00:41:24.000">if we go back...main differences</p>
      <p begin="00:41:24.000" end="00:41:29.640">...now listening to some pointer events so we listen to the...pressed...released</p>
      <p begin="00:41:29.640" end="00:41:35.120">and cancel and we set up manipulation handlers here.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:35.120" end="00:41:38.410">Like we did in the previous sample.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:38.410" end="00:41:39.090">Again,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:39.090" end="00:41:44.520">some transform setup that's our setting set-up and</p>
      <p begin="00:41:44.520" end="00:41:48.820">...pointer handlers so when somebody puts their finger down on that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:48.820" end="00:41:50.400">...we're going to start getting</p>
      <p begin="00:41:50.400" end="00:41:54.670">pointer events on it we capture like we were doing and the like</p>
      <p begin="00:41:54.670" end="00:41:59.560">a sliders behind-the-scenes so if your finger starts on the wracked and maybe due to</p>
      <p begin="00:41:59.560" end="00:42:03.600">hire rotating it or maybe you've got scale translations turned on even if your finger</p>
      <p begin="00:42:03.600" end="00:42:07.460">comes slightly off the elemental still send the input to that element</p>
      <p begin="00:42:07.460" end="00:42:12.140">set capture when you come down on it and then we have these process events</p>
      <p begin="00:42:12.140" end="00:42:15.540">...gesture recognizer so you can see here we</p>
      <p begin="00:42:15.540" end="00:42:21.630">call process down and you pass in that...down to gesture recognizer similarly for</p>

      <p begin="00:43:01.890" end="00:43:06.240">We've gotten as far as getting...raw data on a rector getting...data and we've shoveled</p>
      <p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:07.890">...gesture recognizer now just</p>
      <p begin="00:43:07.890" end="00:43:12.760">recognizes working behind the scenes and it figures out what gestures you're seeing so that's when you</p>
      <p begin="00:43:12.760" end="00:43:15.600">start getting these manipulation events so.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:16.650" end="00:43:21.380">Much like the previous sample in manipulation started and in the inertia and complete</p>

      <p begin="00:43:23.340" end="00:43:29.280">in manipulation updated which is like examples manipulation delta events we're.</p>

      <p begin="00:56:37.140" end="00:56:42.050">one final thought before wrap-up it's not just about the code it's about how users interact</p>
      <p begin="00:56:42.050" end="00:56:47.080">with your app and the so ui design to you should think about things in</p>

      <p begin="00:58:03.670" end="00:58:08.700">and will help answer questions about what developers need to think about when their building apps...to be aware</p>
      <p begin="00:58:08.700" end="00:58:14.200">...experience and finally six fifty eight the design talk I just mention this will</p>
      <p begin="00:58:14.200" end="00:58:16.790">...apps users love?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:16.790" end="00:58:21.580">...samples pretty much everything I showed you today has a sample and one shape perform up on get</p>
      <p begin="00:58:21.580" end="00:58:26.490">hub today we will take all the code that we put together for this talk and get cleaned up and</p>
      <p begin="00:58:26.490" end="00:58:29.840">get it up on get...</p>
      <p begin="00:58:29.840" end="00:58:34.610">...today...the biggest take away is universal windows platform is going</p>
      <p begin="00:58:34.610" end="00:58:40.000">to drop hundreds of millions of...address of all systems in your lap and the</p>
      <p begin="00:58:40.000" end="00:58:44.600">platform...really easy few to build apps that run on all those devices the apps</p>
      <p begin="00:58:44.600" end="00:58:49.320">the do best will be the ones that do well across the broad set</p>

      <p begin="00:58:52.550" end="00:58:57.240">...you is that are platform can make easy free to handle input on all those devices</p>
      <p begin="00:58:57.240" end="00:58:58.810">...go forward</p>
      <p begin="00:58:58.810" end="00:59:05.700">...apps hopefully now you have all the tools to build whatever you can envision thank you?</p>
      <p begin="00:59:09.710" end="00:59:12.290">I think we have two minutes for questions</p>
      <p begin="00:59:12.290" end="00:59:16.240">...far questions compton...but,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:16.240" end="00:59:21.350">otherwise I will be at the speakers lounge the insider lounge for the next...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:21.350" end="00:59:28.480">happy answer questions there too.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:28.480" end="00:59:35.690">Can use the mikes so the video can capture?</p>
      <p begin="00:59:35.690" end="00:59:40.170">So, if I wanted to use like capture gesture like I'm swiping over</p>
      <p begin="00:59:40.170" end="00:59:43.870">...particular control...capture that or if I draw a circle I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:59:43.870" end="00:59:47.110">be able to tell the difference between the two of those encode</p>
      <p begin="00:59:47.110" end="00:59:51.610">but I use something like that to do it argue that...question</p>
      <p begin="00:59:51.610" end="00:59:56.370">...so something like a circle isn't a gesture that the system</p>
      <p begin="00:59:56.370" end="01:00:02.010">detects natively it's not part of our core interaction language we don't use you know, sort</p>
      <p begin="01:00:02.010" end="01:00:04.160">...circle gesture for anything you could</p>
      <p begin="01:00:04.160" end="01:00:08.510">though detect things likes wipes and then have your own custom detection the</p>
      <p begin="01:00:08.510" end="01:00:13.340">detects a circle and make some decision about those like that's a great place where you could user gesture recognizer</p>
      <p begin="01:00:13.340" end="01:00:17.660">fit some data and see if you got something like a translation or a</p>
      <p begin="01:00:17.660" end="01:00:21.450">...kind of gesture and also be feeding the data to your own just</p>
      <p begin="01:00:21.450" end="01:00:27.310">...that looks for something that's like a circle and then decide what you want to based on that?</p>
      <p begin="01:00:27.310" end="01:00:32.180">...enc recognizer ...question so...</p>
      <p begin="01:00:32.180" end="01:00:36.260">You have looked at the gradual...new at the step stuff so...get the</p>
      <p begin="01:00:36.260" end="01:00:41.250">...once they've been there for a little while I think they're exposed and when age...to be nice if you</p>
      <p begin="01:00:41.250" end="01:00:44.470">...whatever you're calling...under the hood your</p>
      <p begin="01:00:44.470" end="01:00:48.810">...your tuning gesture recognizer...guessing nice if you</p>
      <p begin="01:00:48.810" end="01:00:54.860">doing core input thing you can't use animal...direct...whatever the subroutine</p>

      <p begin="01:00:58.030" end="01:01:02.240">of yourself that's good feedback you are correct that they're not...today unjust</p>
      <p begin="01:01:02.240" end="01:01:07.930">recognizer you could build those experiences yourself but,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:07.930" end="01:01:12.720">yeah, that's interesting feedback they are exposed at the direct manipulation layer</p>
      <p begin="01:01:12.720" end="01:01:17.860">and in something like example that shows up in scroll viewer or as</p>
      <p begin="01:01:17.860" end="01:01:22.450">cs properties in a web app but if you're using gesture organizer we don't have the</p>
