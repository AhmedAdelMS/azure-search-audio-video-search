      <p begin="00:01:35.290" end="00:01:38.910">...aspects of based on at five and dn x which is what we've built</p>

      <p begin="00:01:59.000" end="00:02:02.560">But, there are couple of the commands as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.560" end="00:02:03.270">So, we have</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.270" end="00:02:08.200">dn x this is the command used actually execute your application right and you can see here</p>

      <p begin="00:02:12.390" end="00:02:18.420">doing in the local folder and what command is that you want to run that's pretty much all this does?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.420" end="00:02:22.280">Then you have been you d new is sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.280" end="00:02:26.590">where everything else goes is the utility of how you build...how you package</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.590" end="00:02:31.540">it's how you create a deployment artifacts and you can pusher websites or might thing is it doing the work or</p>

      <p begin="00:03:02.570" end="00:03:07.540">ones of these commands...using so, if I go back to dane the list?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:07.540" end="00:03:12.470">actually...correctness I'm within back in here you can see the currently I have one</p>

      <p begin="00:04:10.000" end="00:04:13.910">strategy for system but we don't generally recommend that generally this be doing this of the use</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.910" end="00:04:18.290">...level all right so I could change if I wanted to I could say if I go back and say the</p>

      <p begin="00:05:37.480" end="00:05:42.210">And, what that means so we have a...dot net consul application you'll know that when you compile</p>
      <p begin="00:05:42.210" end="00:05:45.020">you can executable and...double-click that you probably have a</p>

      <p begin="00:07:54.640" end="00:07:58.460">later ones you could see how easy to do them so when I run this from the command-line</p>
      <p begin="00:07:58.460" end="00:08:03.230">...this morning the same app in different ways just like I can get into my house from the front...side or,</p>

      <p begin="00:21:25.950" end="00:21:31.720">then we'll just debug that and then we'll use that story in the next talk,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:31.720" end="00:21:35.620">yeah, we could do that what I might do just to speed this up you have</p>

      <p begin="00:23:30.180" end="00:23:35.060">does the goal one after that and that's a unique instance</p>
      <p begin="00:23:35.060" end="00:23:41.660">id for this object instance of that class how many people use make object id all the time.</p>

      <p begin="00:32:35.170" end="00:32:39.860">...solution only really only have one set of card well we've merged into one thing we've made</p>
      <p begin="00:32:39.860" end="00:32:43.510">a first-class concept we borrowed heavily from the work done by</p>
      <p begin="00:32:43.510" end="00:32:49.250">the universal projects system, you know, the...project stuff they did last year to get a local features</p>
      <p begin="00:32:49.250" end="00:32:54.240">of that so if I come over here in my class we can see some of the benefits of the up here in the loop</p>

      <p begin="00:33:03.740" end="00:33:08.840">file get a new context in fact if I come down here and let's say I also want to build this for net</p>
      <p begin="00:33:08.840" end="00:33:11.790">four five one.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:11.790" end="00:33:13.810">They say that.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:13.810" end="00:33:15.280">Say that.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:15.280" end="00:33:18.520">Notice now that dot net framework for five-one showed up in there so</p>
      <p begin="00:33:18.520" end="00:33:23.420">now I'm compiling three times when I build this and the difference here is the using the</p>

      <p begin="00:33:26.590" end="00:33:32.610">four-by-one the way we write...next as a bunch of things a...also...so this is</p>

      <p begin="00:33:37.310" end="00:33:42.430">...the secret when you do it this way it's still the next doing just that uses a different set of references</p>

      <p begin="00:33:46.410" end="00:33:51.150">...ok so when I'm writing card this way though eventually I'm going to hits and</p>
      <p begin="00:33:51.150" end="00:33:56.230">scenes and people often ask me so we have this dot net core thing we have dot...framework</p>
      <p begin="00:33:56.230" end="00:34:00.880">...the new hardness it goes...linux...across platters portable it portable I can make</p>

      <p begin="00:34:09.920" end="00:34:15.770">know that there's one thing that we've moved around which is how you set the culture for the current thread</p>
      <p begin="00:34:15.770" end="00:34:20.940">of internationalization, internationalization right so let's say in the constructor of this ridiculous</p>
      <p begin="00:34:20.940" end="00:34:24.370">...okay so I could do thread?</p>
      <p begin="00:34:24.370" end="00:34:27.910">...control dot now.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:27.910" end="00:34:28.770">Look, at this.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:29.790" end="00:34:34.070">Move this is interesting because we talked about how before</p>
      <p begin="00:34:34.070" end="00:34:38.790">...framework was this monolithic right and now you literally saying that system</p>
      <p begin="00:34:38.790" end="00:34:43.210">dot threading is just a piece it really is a cafeteria plan when you run dot net call when you're not</p>
      <p begin="00:34:43.210" end="00:34:48.480">...yes so if I did using system dot threading this woodwork full</p>
      <p begin="00:34:48.480" end="00:34:51.000">...yes...if I...to is everywhere I need to</p>
      <p begin="00:34:51.000" end="00:34:56.600">pull in this package that lights up that frayed api on all the frameworks</p>
      <p begin="00:34:56.600" end="00:35:00.900">...only ships and uses what it needs and nothing else</p>
      <p begin="00:35:00.900" end="00:35:05.100">...that threading thing it doesn't even show up absolutely...here...go back to my project</p>
      <p begin="00:35:05.100" end="00:35:11.010">...file there...threading...dependency of that thing down there okay so...current</p>
      <p begin="00:35:11.010" end="00:35:15.810">...dot current culture but you'll night if you look at the intelligence here.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:15.810" end="00:35:19.570">See it's giving me it's telling me...little warning triangle in the same completion</p>
      <p begin="00:35:19.570" end="00:35:22.990">...saying hey this method is available in two of those frameworks</p>
      <p begin="00:35:22.990" end="00:35:26.290">this property but not in the last one we call this combined</p>
      <p begin="00:35:26.290" end="00:35:31.050">intelligence you're getting intelligence for all target frameworks at the same time while you're in</p>
      <p begin="00:35:31.050" end="00:35:35.960">the file ok this then again these are all tools to help you in this world of...out on a</p>
      <p begin="00:35:35.960" end="00:35:41.150">...dot net for five code okay over to dot net...building tools to help you do that how would I go</p>
      <p begin="00:35:41.150" end="00:35:45.270">and figure out what I should do...panicking at this point I'm like well why need that so,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:45.270" end="00:35:49.190">yeah, so, that's really good question at the moment the bringing in the...one</p>
      <p begin="00:35:49.190" end="00:35:54.150">of the things we did so if we didn't have that you may be trying to using a will that api doesn't exist right where is</p>
      <p begin="00:35:54.150" end="00:35:58.140">it in a package...in a word is we have that stuff in terms of the case here when you find</p>
      <p begin="00:35:58.140" end="00:36:04.040">...api difference that...documentation right now which is a little early on because we're</p>
      <p begin="00:36:04.040" end="00:36:07.140">...of things force but I can tell you I know-how to do that so I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:36:07.140" end="00:36:12.330">say new culture infer and that's going to.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:12.330" end="00:36:20.010">Experience...go and we'll do in-dash.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:20.010" end="00:36:26.850">So, now I've got I'm saying the current culture to...trying build this project now.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:26.850" end="00:36:31.140">But, note the project name movie here is thread does not contain a definition of</p>
      <p begin="00:36:31.140" end="00:36:33.110">...project contexts project</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.110" end="00:36:38.060">...remember gave me the warning it said this...api isn't available on one of them so I</p>
      <p begin="00:36:38.060" end="00:36:42.500">...I need to fixes I've hit one of those seams between the two well so I can use</p>
      <p begin="00:36:42.500" end="00:36:45.560">...if there and I will admit this experience of</p>
      <p begin="00:36:45.560" end="00:36:49.310">...isn't the best one I think we have a little bit of work to do here to make this</p>
      <p begin="00:36:49.310" end="00:36:54.020">...really nice experience because if that's going to be a little bit more common now...I dn x</p>
      <p begin="00:36:54.020" end="00:37:00.420">...fifty which is the symbol we used to represent when I'm on that</p>
      <p begin="00:37:00.420" end="00:37:04.190">And, I'll do the rest of that down there so in this case of...is backwards</p>
      <p begin="00:37:04.190" end="00:37:07.010">...need to move this code out of there.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:07.010" end="00:37:11.890">And, put that down there okay and then I need to switch on a switch over to this context</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.890" end="00:37:17.030">dot nickel fifty...ethical fifty and wiser importance which content because not</p>
      <p begin="00:37:17.030" end="00:37:21.350">...right this is one of the things I don't like about this experience right now what I</p>
      <p begin="00:37:21.350" end="00:37:27.360">would rather do is if I put my clustering here that becomes the active context.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:27.360" end="00:37:27.850">Yeah, so,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:27.850" end="00:37:33.040">anyway, we're still working on this the right now you just kinda have to understand that you need to do</p>
      <p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:38.510">...sometimes you have to do I don't think I'm that smart I like it this way you like this way well if I</p>
      <p begin="00:37:38.510" end="00:37:43.170">say I think that just by virtue of my cursor being in a different place I would confused, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:43.170" end="00:37:47.340">I don't know so the other thing that you don't see right now is notice before when I had</p>
      <p begin="00:37:47.340" end="00:37:52.880">this when I had this out of it when I had this of...yeah, if I move this outside you could just switch</p>
      <p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:55.720">context now I want actually move that into the on?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:57.580" end="00:38:01.170">This is showing an error here because I switch...if I do this, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:01.170" end="00:38:06.030">what I want to see that squiggly even though I'm not in that context...I want to know</p>

      <p begin="00:38:23.120" end="00:38:27.670">note will work and then I happen to know that to do this on the and I want</p>

      <p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:44.750">pulled in the gi or where what let me switch context to get all that working in the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:44.750" end="00:38:49.640">...against yank...because I mean there which I think is a little bit clumsy</p>

      <p begin="00:39:06.410" end="00:39:11.410">...that's interesting what does that mean so it means something went wrong during reference I'm going to delete</p>

      <p begin="00:39:13.640" end="00:39:17.170">...script and we'll check out there...it's saying is</p>
      <p begin="00:39:17.170" end="00:39:28.670">...is package...this package so I brought in a little bit too...get rid of that.</p>

      <p begin="00:39:32.460" end="00:39:33.690">I might be hitting a</p>

      <p begin="00:39:38.520" end="00:39:43.490">...context into the wrong into too many places I'm going to put this down here so</p>
      <p begin="00:39:43.490" end="00:39:47.870">that fixes...it's interesting because you've got dependencies which is everybody's design</p>
      <p begin="00:39:47.870" end="00:39:52.170">nancy's and then under frameworks he's got dependencies just for this thing up so,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:52.170" end="00:39:55.980">for example, if you were doing ...now we don't have a graphics generator</p>
      <p begin="00:39:55.980" end="00:40:01.010">in core so let's say that you are doing check imaging for a bank or whatever and</p>
      <p begin="00:40:01.010" end="00:40:05.920">then you're moving that over from full framework to core and like up I just had a seem you're</p>
      <p begin="00:40:05.920" end="00:40:10.150">...to go and find a core framework library that does that imaging build</p>
      <p begin="00:40:10.150" end="00:40:12.860">the layer of abstraction on top of it and then if...</p>
      <p begin="00:40:12.860" end="00:40:17.580">around that you would have but you wouldn't want to take that library that new imaging library</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.580" end="00:40:23.070">and reference in the full framework version so that would become some that would go under the dependency so</p>
      <p begin="00:40:23.070" end="00:40:26.940">you say the...dependencies...shared are here</p>
      <p begin="00:40:26.940" end="00:40:31.760">...ones for this framework...here and the ones for...there so you're basically getting references</p>
      <p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:34.720">...that are specific to the target framework that you</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.720" end="00:40:41.780">want to use absolutely I think I have indexing bugging...tenets working in the same</p>
      <p begin="00:40:41.780" end="00:40:46.850">...absolutely so what I've done here is I know I have in...this is the api</p>
      <p begin="00:40:46.850" end="00:40:52.460">that use naps of the current culture and...actually does it come from it's just in threading...different namespaces</p>
      <p begin="00:40:52.460" end="00:40:59.840">...mobilization like I'll...threading current culture that is the one that</p>

      <p begin="00:41:09.240" end="00:41:13.410">...good status documentation up...get hub where they talk about as a movie things around</p>
      <p begin="00:41:13.410" end="00:41:17.500">...why that there's even some interesting videos where you can see the</p>

      <p begin="00:41:38.430" end="00:41:44.870">yeah, is like...developers are not...coding we just young and we have...we have</p>
      <p begin="00:41:44.870" end="00:41:49.200">Just...sit...okay so what I build this which so before we actually get anything when</p>
      <p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:54.370">we build this right...others no been...been debug right what's have a look so here's my</p>
      <p begin="00:41:54.370" end="00:41:57.960">...folder right now here's my ideal how do I get stuff we'll do that and</p>

      <p begin="00:52:59.450" end="00:53:03.860">...string this is actual csharp...he control spicier.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:03.860" end="00:53:05.350">I mean csharp.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:05.350" end="00:53:10.780">So, tag...going fundamentally change...hang on.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:10.780" end="00:53:18.300">Go ahead.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:18.300" end="00:53:22.970">What is...as attempting language when it comes down to it right what defines attempting language has</p>
      <p begin="00:53:22.970" end="00:53:27.520">...it has...opinionated way of doing something spock does something...enamel...something on my</p>
      <p begin="00:53:27.520" end="00:53:29.780">...about taking csharp?</p>
      <p begin="00:53:29.780" end="00:53:33.410">And, html...together with this few seems possible</p>
      <p begin="00:53:33.410" end="00:53:37.820">that previously we did that with the app character you would say at blog you would call help</p>
      <p begin="00:53:37.820" end="00:53:43.010">...would return golf and then of you would guard right we've just gone one step further and said why can't we</p>
      <p begin="00:53:43.010" end="00:53:47.900">just go html attribute equals...have that blobby...</p>
      <p begin="00:53:47.900" end="00:53:52.390">Without me having to switch transition...for tackles that's what we've done that we built in order to</p>
      <p begin="00:53:52.390" end="00:53:56.500">...so this has to be here a number if I...something here that isn't</p>
      <p begin="00:53:56.500" end="00:54:02.870">a number like date time dot now and I closes out so I can finish</p>
      <p begin="00:54:02.870" end="00:54:08.170">wait while a generic who because it's csharp right.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:08.170" end="00:54:11.440">So, let's go back here and I'm going to make this one now if I did have a</p>
      <p begin="00:54:11.440" end="00:54:17.420">...declared...through whatever that would be in...could just...on the model whatever.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:17.420" end="00:54:19.810">So, I have actually implemented anything yet right so let's go</p>
      <p begin="00:54:19.810" end="00:54:22.840">...implement the rest of this help them.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:22.840" end="00:54:25.220">Which is pretty straightforward so...I need to do is</p>
      <p begin="00:54:25.220" end="00:54:26.870">...if counts?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:28.030" end="00:54:32.120">Is...to that again from scratch if count?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:32.120" end="00:54:34.860">Is less than equalizer I'm going to return that</p>
      <p begin="00:54:34.860" end="00:54:41.920">...being nice and defensive otherwise I'm going to do a full loop and say for all?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:45.430">And, I'm going to call back content equals</p>
      <p begin="00:54:47.030" end="00:54:50.580">...on the context object that's passed in this method</p>
      <p begin="00:54:50.580" end="00:54:53.750">hit get child content icing get</p>
      <p begin="00:54:53.750" end="00:54:57.190">...all the content inside the element execute that</p>
      <p begin="00:54:57.190" end="00:55:00.970">...now...executed get by the time this process methods running so that'll</p>
      <p begin="00:55:00.970" end="00:55:04.700">...and they'll keep parsing and chaining everything together right and then let,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:04.700" end="00:55:09.630">you know, at the last and then you'll do...you...to the whoever's above you so it's a stack and we</p>
      <p begin="00:55:09.630" end="00:55:12.780">papa stack as we go down and...unwind through the hierarchy</p>
      <p begin="00:55:12.780" end="00:55:17.930">...html elements now this method is...so it's only going to run once so I can just call it</p>
      <p begin="00:55:17.930" end="00:55:22.420">...here...obviously...what memorized memo onbasically it's like...item</p>
      <p begin="00:55:22.420" end="00:55:28.590">pardoned method you call it once...the same as you just explain a complicated word with another complicated work.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:28.590" end="00:55:38.670">It...the result internally...</p>
      <p begin="00:55:38.670" end="00:55:43.590">From now people can look up...one homework they...</p>
      <p begin="00:55:44.650" end="00:55:47.810">All right we'll computer science...summing all right so</p>
      <p begin="00:55:47.810" end="00:55:52.210">then I'm going to come in here and I'm going to actually append stuff to the outputs on</p>
      <p begin="00:55:52.210" end="00:55:58.820">the output dot content dot append that content.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:58.820" end="00:56:02.570">Now we've been very careful with how we...tag...to have a</p>
      <p begin="00:56:02.570" end="00:56:07.270">...a buffering...we...make sure that we don't just end up creating a huge join string that they</p>
      <p begin="00:56:07.270" end="00:56:11.540">...than right so this output object here is actually of type tag</p>
      <p begin="00:56:11.540" end="00:56:15.460">helper output and when you...content that's...a</p>
      <p begin="00:56:15.460" end="00:56:20.480">...for a reason that is of type tag...content thing it's a thing</p>
      <p begin="00:56:20.480" end="00:56:24.380">...okay custom data structure that knows how to do the right is not string</p>
      <p begin="00:56:24.380" end="00:56:30.200">...that string builders all the way down...it's a custom one that we make sure...over certain size and lots of</p>
      <p begin="00:56:30.200" end="00:56:37.790">...okay so that's what should have to do right those...specific control if?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:37.790" end="00:56:40.820">So, now I think I...to yet right so essentially twice now as</p>
      <p begin="00:56:40.820" end="00:56:47.380">it twice now that's actually looks exactly like the before but just to prove it to you.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:47.380" end="00:56:55.750">As repeated three times okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:55.750" end="00:56:56.930">...encode moi.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:58.480" end="00:57:03.160">Achievement...samoa.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:03.160" end="00:57:08.770">...that's how easy to build...up of let's very quickly to commands...the last two minutes</p>
      <p begin="00:57:08.770" end="00:57:21.500">two minutes one two-and-half minutes challenge I'm not saying we're going to finish you have two minutes twenty...</p>
      <p begin="00:57:21.500" end="00:57:25.980">The demo...might be all right so I'm going to do a</p>
      <p begin="00:57:25.980" end="00:57:30.770">...consul application...smoot smoothed press past</p>
      <p begin="00:57:30.770" end="00:57:36.630">tense of might lighted saluted...smith...</p>
      <p begin="00:57:36.630" end="00:57:39.540">...the common-law so I created a.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:39.540" end="00:57:44.730">Everything in the column we are...consul up on over the project...file...created</p>
      <p begin="00:57:44.730" end="00:57:49.490">a command forming that is itself...of inception going on here from a consul app</p>
      <p begin="00:57:49.490" end="00:57:54.870">indian x is just...the next app web...any it's the same type of thing</p>
      <p begin="00:57:54.870" end="00:58:00.290">...no difference the same thing that has a command configured two-run itself this is</p>
      <p begin="00:58:00.290" end="00:58:04.960">my entry point you've declared...declared my entry point so I have a</p>
      <p begin="00:58:04.960" end="00:58:09.470">...program cs with the static void...this case national static incidence...support instance</p>
      <p begin="00:58:09.470" end="00:58:15.350">...now which is kinda nice so we can do things like depends injection indeo construct.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:15.350" end="00:58:17.810">And, if I want to run this...the command-line now if I do a from</p>
      <p begin="00:58:17.810" end="00:58:24.240">...going to run a particular wide let me go back here and you turn on the magic button.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:24.240" end="00:58:25.790">Build this.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:25.790" end="00:58:27.110">Ok.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:27.110" end="00:58:31.830">Now actually make do anything I probably should write something out there consoled</p>
      <p begin="00:58:33.140" end="00:58:36.170">I actually has a wma skiers something that I do have something nice</p>
      <p begin="00:58:36.170" end="00:58:43.510">...that looks pretty good will come over here output that cm?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:43.510" end="00:58:46.100">Okay, if I run that just prove that works.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:46.100" end="00:58:52.250">...impressed...first...go off so now I've but, I'm building that out to the command-line</p>
      <p begin="00:58:52.250" end="00:58:54.660">...to run this as a command from the command-line let's open</p>
      <p begin="00:58:54.660" end="00:58:58.510">...folder so you just read as a command-line apple regular from...ran it from</p>
      <p begin="00:58:58.510" end="00:59:04.650">...from the right so...would that for me I want to prove that this is actually standalone thing so I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:59:04.650" end="00:59:08.590">do and...think about commands...commands like if you're familiar with node</p>
      <p begin="00:59:08.590" end="00:59:13.170">you've got like grunt and express and things like that they are utilities commands that are</p>
      <p begin="00:59:13.170" end="00:59:16.460">available, you know, possibly globally that you might want to use</p>
      <p begin="00:59:16.460" end="00:59:21.040">...published those somewhere so you all could make commands that then we could go in</p>
      <p begin="00:59:21.040" end="00:59:22.730">new get in to</p>
      <p begin="00:59:22.730" end="00:59:27.480">our web applications and then use as utilities so I've gone into the</p>
      <p begin="00:59:27.480" end="00:59:32.470">at folder inside artifacts...photo down here note there's my...file</p>

      <p begin="00:59:45.060" end="00:59:49.980">You have negative twenty seconds.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:49.980" end="00:59:54.900">...my god...there is the nigger package now is not going to work because</p>
      <p begin="00:59:54.900" end="01:00:00.200">I'm things and that has the same the files in it...the...file...that only but if you...believe me</p>
      <p begin="01:00:01.410" end="01:00:06.760">...so that has the it has those files and I'm going...going...lights are coming up</p>
