      <p begin="00:00:00.830" end="00:00:06.120">Welcome everyone welcome to the asher which...deep dive session and</p>
      <p begin="00:00:06.120" end="00:00:09.580">...a program manager in the as your computing I've</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.580" end="00:00:14.160">...the...for about two years now and I've been working on you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.160" end="00:00:17.820">the new compute stack that is being introduce under-resourced manager</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.820" end="00:00:23.130">today so we'll be spending a lot of time talking about itbefore we go to deep I just</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.130" end="00:00:28.590">...to...get a quick check on how many of, you know, about resource manager of heard about it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.590" end="00:00:35.790">and, you know, listen to...about it thirty forty percent so that's good?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.790" end="00:00:40.650">Because this is the reason I ask...is a...level session we're going to go deep dive you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.650" end="00:00:45.050">talk a lot more about the in a compute advancement that we've made so,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.050" end="00:00:49.090">it does expect a little bit of understanding of what casual virtual machines is</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.090" end="00:00:55.160">I hope most of you are new to virtual machines have listen to the introduction to...action</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.160" end="00:01:01.190">so, this...will be a little bit more high-level so let me just you want...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.190" end="00:01:06.400">so hi my name is marshall I'm a program manager on...cloud platform to scene my team</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.400" end="00:01:11.740">looks after everything related to tooling for what we say hyper</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.740" end="00:01:16.860">...large-scale compute so as your virtual machines service fabric io</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.860" end="00:01:21.650">to scenarios everything that goes back right cool.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.650" end="00:01:27.980">So, manages slide you give us feedback we'd love to hear feedback from you so we can</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.980" end="00:01:29.980">...accordingly and...and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.980" end="00:01:35.280">...right so ...we covering todaywe're going to focus on.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:39.820">Heavily on the isv to stack for folks who don't or not</p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.820" end="00:01:44.360">...at build we announced the introduction of the new compute model compute apis</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.360" end="00:01:49.390">under-resourced manager aviv term this I is vtwo and we're going to color lot</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.390" end="00:01:53.710">...between today session the second part of...we're going to focus a little bit on how</p>
      <p begin="00:01:53.710" end="00:01:58.380">we are improving the devon test story even further but integration of compute network and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:03.000">storage stack under-resourced manager...be going deep dive into some of the tempting</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.000" end="00:02:08.150">...will actually social shows and cool demos...sharepoint and things like that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.150" end="00:02:12.080">then will focus a little bit on how to actually deploy complex applications and I</p>
      <p begin="00:02:12.080" end="00:02:17.160">as will pick up a sample will walk through how to build a complex template and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:17.160" end="00:02:21.860">actually go ahead and deployed...the end we'll talk a little bit about the single unify</p>
      <p begin="00:02:21.860" end="00:02:25.240">...for the compute cloud you might have heard some announcements at the keynote or</p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.240" end="00:02:28.160">the foundation session so we'll talk a little bit about that the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:28.160" end="00:02:32.610">...something that you have not seen before right?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.610" end="00:02:36.030">Given the fact that there's thirty to forty percent of people who have kind of heard about</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.030" end="00:02:39.770">...I'm just going to spend a couple of minutes introducing the concepts for</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.770" end="00:02:44.990">...not heard about it resource groups are up...manager is a new service that is</p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.990" end="00:02:49.450">...and measure has been around for about a year now we've.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:49.450" end="00:02:53.390">We've had support for sql databases websites and a bunch of other</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.390" end="00:02:57.880">...resource providers but compute network and storage announcement happens today happens with the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.880" end="00:03:02.670">build announcement so, I'm going to talk about some basically, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:02.670" end="00:03:08.210">basic...resource group-think of them as a logical container which allows you to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:08.210" end="00:03:11.270">plays a set of resources in a in it together and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.270" end="00:03:18.190">resource scope think of an application you...think of an application like say ...you know, like a</p>
      <p begin="00:03:18.190" end="00:03:22.450">...applicant sharepoint, for example, you can choose to...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.450" end="00:03:26.850">Different years of those application in espresso in special...for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.850" end="00:03:32.490">you can say hey I want my...resource group I want mine you know, sequel</p>
      <p begin="00:03:32.490" end="00:03:37.190">...a separate resource group and data...a database theorem differently so you can choose to do that but the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:37.190" end="00:03:42.050">idea behind resource group is that we provide capabilities on the platform which allows you to manage the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:42.050" end="00:03:46.460">entity as a whole a good example would be in a devon test scenario you actually have a single app</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.460" end="00:03:51.400">...you can choose to delete the entire resource group as a whole which is a big advantage typically if</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.400" end="00:03:56.390">you think about scenarios what you're doing large-scale applications you have hundred nodes that, you know, spinning up and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.390" end="00:04:01.230">spinning down management of those nodes are pretty hard so resource groups allows you the flexibility</p>
      <p begin="00:04:01.230" end="00:04:05.950">to, you know, either delete the entire set of nodes as a single...you make a single</p>
      <p begin="00:04:05.950" end="00:04:08.780">...resource group and we take care of deleting all entities</p>
      <p begin="00:04:08.780" end="00:04:14.060">...now...I want to re-use resource groups...think about it is think...</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14.060" end="00:04:18.970">for properties think about the lifecycle of the resources how do I want my app...look like do I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.970" end="00:04:24.310">place mightier in a separate entity or do I want...or...in a single resource group it's up to you</p>
      <p begin="00:04:24.310" end="00:04:28.800">can choose but keep in mind the lifecycle aspect of it the second is tagging are</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:33.250">billing think about how you want to tagged resources because what we've enabled is</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33.250" end="00:04:38.560">the capability where you can now getthe tags that are...on resources propagated to the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:43.240">...any tagged...for example, like say...in application...good...db,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:43.240" end="00:04:47.700">for example, that tag will not just stay in a ui level...for query</p>
      <p begin="00:04:47.700" end="00:04:52.260">will actually propagate through and be available at the end in your customer...at the end of the month</p>
      <p begin="00:04:52.260" end="00:04:55.430">...cs refile so that you can actually go build rich</p>
      <p begin="00:04:55.430" end="00:04:58.170">...charts to say how you know-how much of my each department</p>
      <p begin="00:04:58.170" end="00:05:03.020">cosco building is a key aspect of how you architect your resource...how you place the resources and resource</p>
      <p begin="00:05:03.020" end="00:05:06.070">group another aspect of as it is rule-based</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.070" end="00:05:11.830">access control think about how who gets access to a particular resources, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.830" end="00:05:16.730">if you have a database...you want to actually give access...access only to the database adnan if</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.730" end="00:05:21.300">you have virtual network instead of networking properties you want to give only the network admin</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.300" end="00:05:24.110">...access to everybody else can get...access but you want to just</p>
      <p begin="00:05:24.110" end="00:05:28.790">...give write access to the other so think about these different aspects when you are</p>
      <p begin="00:05:28.790" end="00:05:33.450">...creating resource group and placing them in a different entities the last one here is if</p>
      <p begin="00:05:33.450" end="00:05:38.340">you're thinking about high availability or dr scenarios...resource could actually spans</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.340" end="00:05:42.970">...you actually have among the db which has the primary sitting in let's...best us but the second</p>
      <p begin="00:05:42.970" end="00:05:47.640">...actually second resource sitting in a different region you can choose to actually plays all of that in a single resource</p>
      <p begin="00:05:47.640" end="00:05:52.920">could because the resource...spans an entire...entire globe...as well as regions that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52.920" end="00:05:58.210">...so keep that in mind ok so the key aspects are if you should,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58.210" end="00:06:01.550">should resources being a same resource group or not you should always think about the common</p>
      <p begin="00:06:01.550" end="00:06:04.840">lifecycle the patterns the building aspects of it and then</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.840" end="00:06:09.340">architecture application accordingly and we don't support this for now but we will</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.340" end="00:06:13.790">act support in the future but even if you make a mistake of actually placing a set of resources</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.790" end="00:06:16.290">in a specific resource...you're like hey I want to move this to</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.290" end="00:06:20.240">...entity because that's where the lifecycle matches better...support apis</p>
      <p begin="00:06:20.240" end="00:06:25.960">where you can actually move resources between resource crips in the future to make your management better?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:25.960" end="00:06:26.950">Ok,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:26.950" end="00:06:32.420">the next aspect is you guys have heard a lot about it going to spend a brief amount of time here I'm going to produce</p>
      <p begin="00:06:32.420" end="00:06:35.660">templates template support has existed in the platform for</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.660" end="00:06:39.230">a about a year now I'm going to go deep into it but I do want to talk about</p>
      <p begin="00:06:39.230" end="00:06:43.940">...of the advantages that it offers when in context of compute</p>
      <p begin="00:06:43.940" end="00:06:49.240">right previously we just had...and databases but with introduction of compute it opens up an entire</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.240" end="00:06:52.260">gamut of applications that you can now go build an architect</p>
      <p begin="00:06:52.260" end="00:06:56.840">on asher and the inherent capabilities that template language provides a is actually</p>
      <p begin="00:06:56.840" end="00:07:02.380">very helpful because templates themselves are item important just because it's so just by saying the templates</p>
      <p begin="00:07:02.380" end="00:07:06.560">...importantly also means that the apis that are backed by the templates but also</p>
      <p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:10.990">important, for example, if you actually have a virtual machine and...you...with</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.990" end="00:07:13.330">...of data disks and you actually do a get</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.330" end="00:07:17.880">...and...back to asher is actually going to accept that request and continue</p>
      <p begin="00:07:17.880" end="00:07:22.610">...process and say it's going to give you a success immediately so all the apis going forward that are supported</p>
      <p begin="00:07:22.610" end="00:07:26.370">...rasio resource manager for compute is item...compute network</p>
      <p begin="00:07:26.370" end="00:07:31.810">...and the...language offers this orchestration capability so,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:31.810" end="00:07:36.870">when I talk about orchestration it has the capability where you can actually define a set of resources to be</p>
      <p begin="00:07:36.870" end="00:07:41.300">dependent on each other say I want to spin up in the case of ad an active directory</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.300" end="00:07:45.320">...you want to have the primary that...boot-up foursome actually be ready for you want</p>
      <p begin="00:07:45.320" end="00:07:48.170">...your second-rate...can actually express the dependency to say</p>
      <p begin="00:07:48.170" end="00:07:52.750">...to depends on the mone before can actually start up so you actually expressed the dependency at</p>
      <p begin="00:07:52.750" end="00:07:55.310">the infrastructure layer and you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:55.310" end="00:08:00.990">with resource groups and resource manager you also get the flexibility of just trashing</p>
      <p begin="00:08:00.990" end="00:08:05.690">...group and you're doing devon...so we don't offer...capability per say but...simplifies</p>
      <p begin="00:08:05.690" end="00:08:10.520">your rollback mechanism...you just start...the deployment you push something to resource group and...hey,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:10.520" end="00:08:13.830">you know, like step three of the whole deployment just failed instead of</p>
      <p begin="00:08:13.830" end="00:08:17.140">just trying to fix that and go and...around with...you can just say</p>
      <p begin="00:08:18.200" end="00:08:23.870">...scratch is actually pretty easy to do that management and as I said earlier with the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:23.870" end="00:08:28.560">integration of compute network and storage it coupling itself with the...cash</p>
      <p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:33.370">...sequel databases of website it opens and entire gamut of applications for you now you can orchestrate</p>
      <p begin="00:08:33.370" end="00:08:37.350">...build an application or a template which contains all of the as</p>
      <p begin="00:08:37.350" end="00:08:42.380">...manager with compute offering so it gives you a lot more flexibility you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:42.380" end="00:08:46.470">review template files us source files that are checked in manage to maintain and,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:46.470" end="00:08:49.140">you know, used by you guys and...stored on your</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.140" end="00:08:55.070">site and it is continuously used for deployment purposes into measure and,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:55.070" end="00:08:59.710">the parameterization...capability in the temperate itself makes it repeatable so</p>
      <p begin="00:08:59.710" end="00:09:03.060">if you actually have, you know, let's say a sharepoint...you're doing some devon</p>
      <p begin="00:09:03.060" end="00:09:07.750">...if you actually go architect one template you can reuse the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:07.750" end="00:09:10.610">...again and again for rebuilding your app again,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:10.610" end="00:09:15.280">so, it's it becomes a very repeatable very easy with...previous cases you have to go</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.280" end="00:09:20.390">write your owns shell scripts our in lc...or partial scripts to go build your app on as</p>
      <p begin="00:09:20.390" end="00:09:26.530">you're using compute ...simplifies that drastically so devon...becomes fundamentally...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:26.530" end="00:09:29.860">Okay, so, just kind of touch on some of the you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:29.860" end="00:09:34.890">the big improvements here complexities made simple I'll show you some samples about the complex applications that</p>
      <p begin="00:09:34.890" end="00:09:39.780">have gone ahead and build on measure now you can blend and build applications using</p>
      <p begin="00:09:39.780" end="00:09:43.710">...and different paths services that are available in the platform when I talk about passive as a</p>
      <p begin="00:09:43.710" end="00:09:46.340">sequel or websites I'll</p>
      <p begin="00:09:46.340" end="00:09:51.440">dived deep into some of the scaleability aspects of the you virtual machines and...the improvements</p>
      <p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:09:55.190">...major...now you'd be able to spin up you know, hundreds of...really</p>
      <p begin="00:09:55.190" end="00:10:00.930">...it really parallel and the integration of rule-based access control...tags you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:00.930" end="00:10:05.010">offers a great flexibility for enterprise and devon test scenarios which will diving</p>
      <p begin="00:10:05.010" end="00:10:10.210">and what you're seeing that on the right side right-hand side is a new a community template section that</p>
      <p begin="00:10:10.210" end="00:10:15.630">...launched with actual this is going to contain about sixty to seventy...templates which are you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:15.630" end="00:10:19.610">some of them are basic starter templates that lets you get started we also have a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.610" end="00:10:25.210">of complex application templates and will be going little-bitty into that...session?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:25.210" end="00:10:30.170">Okay, so, what are the biggest advantages that are being offered and, it comes to</p>
      <p begin="00:10:30.170" end="00:10:36.040">...computes that first one really is the...parallel deployment of virtual machines one of the common</p>
      <p begin="00:10:36.040" end="00:10:39.160">...coins that used exist with xml based apis that support</p>
      <p begin="00:10:39.160" end="00:10:44.640">supported in the platform was we were not able to process of the address</p>
      <p begin="00:10:44.640" end="00:10:49.910">...would not process simultaneous deployment of virtual machines which you would have faced was obviously and,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:49.910" end="00:10:53.850">that's a massive improvement...the stack now you can actually go ask for let's say</p>
      <p begin="00:10:53.850" end="00:10:58.000">twenty m in availability said if you want and we'll go process all of those twenty</p>
      <p begin="00:10:58.000" end="00:10:59.680">...in parallel so,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:59.680" end="00:11:03.680">that's a big difference than what we got used to perform the second aspect of it is</p>
      <p begin="00:11:03.680" end="00:11:08.630">the platform offered the concept of availability sets that we actually physically</p>
      <p begin="00:11:08.630" end="00:11:14.320">please your virtual machines when you say to...and availability sept we physically placed...and to separate</p>
      <p begin="00:11:14.320" end="00:11:18.990">...some to for domains as we call it this ensure that you had high availability from the platform</p>
      <p begin="00:11:18.990" end="00:11:23.670">...platform roles...now with the introduction of the new compute apis we are increasing that</p>
      <p begin="00:11:23.670" end="00:11:27.010">...three-four domain so for...that require you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:27.010" end="00:11:31.860">like core...workloads now you can actually get...ensure that the platform will not take the third you</p>
      <p begin="00:11:31.860" end="00:11:35.590">...will only take one...down in the tvs at any given time</p>
      <p begin="00:11:35.590" end="00:11:40.350">...this ensures that you always have...to make sure you don't obviously you don't go down and there's</p>
      <p begin="00:11:40.350" end="00:11:46.040">a physical of flac failure and, we've made a lots of lots of improvements around the</p>
      <p begin="00:11:46.040" end="00:11:51.210">...extension capabilities as well to make it work well with the templates and...be...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:51.210" end="00:11:56.700">a detail on that ...made a lot of changes around ...and how things are done you don't have to</p>
      <p begin="00:11:56.700" end="00:12:01.190">use a certificate anymore you just...can directly...a...to rsa format</p>
      <p begin="00:12:01.190" end="00:12:05.140">for the certificates going forward and ...support was announced</p>
      <p begin="00:12:05.140" end="00:12:10.290">on the xml based apis two weeks ago with this announcement we also are introducing</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.290" end="00:12:16.440">the premium storage support on top of the...some based apis aren't...resource manager?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:16.440" end="00:12:17.820">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:17.820" end="00:12:22.260">Now I want to spend a little bit of time talking about the...extensions how many of, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:22.260" end="00:12:25.370">about aggravate extensions?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:25.370" end="00:12:30.170">...k so I have to spend more time okay so, actually</p>
      <p begin="00:12:30.170" end="00:12:32.020">...are so,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:32.020" end="00:12:37.510">...I is virtual machines what you get is the capability of getting just infrastructure getting the...cloud but,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:37.510" end="00:12:42.420">that's not all of it right there's just...of work lot-of in the in configuration that you need to do to actually</p>
      <p begin="00:12:42.420" end="00:12:47.990">go get your app up and running inside the virtual machine so we've partnered but a lot of you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:47.990" end="00:12:50.570">a third-party vendors and who've actually, you know, and,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:50.570" end="00:12:55.560">we have some folks from doctor sitting right in front we have a...extension also on the platform we</p>
      <p begin="00:12:55.560" end="00:13:00.030">...partnered with a lot of the third-party vendors to actually go get the extensions like</p>
      <p begin="00:13:00.030" end="00:13:04.730">chef and pop it into the platform to make it easy for customers to in the and configuration on</p>
      <p begin="00:13:04.730" end="00:13:08.290">...in addition to third-party tools like chef and</p>
      <p begin="00:13:08.290" end="00:13:12.610">pop it and darker we've also focused on getting the basic scripting capability so we</p>
      <p begin="00:13:12.610" end="00:13:16.990">...have customs crypt windows we have customs script linux extensions we can actually write a...script a</p>
      <p begin="00:13:16.990" end="00:13:24.430">python script and ask for to be run inside the which machine...a very easy fashion ...and linux and,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:24.430" end="00:13:27.590">we also have first-class dc support the desired state</p>
      <p begin="00:13:27.590" end="00:13:32.330">configure support from partial we also have first-class support for that and...model so the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:32.330" end="00:13:37.360">...works is that the extensions are created first party you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:37.360" end="00:13:42.170">...agents if you will that are being...the platform and v replicate them all over the what's the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:42.170" end="00:13:45.710">number of virtual machines creator measure we and you say hey I want</p>
      <p begin="00:13:45.710" end="00:13:49.860">push of dc agent into the platform we actually take that agent from one of</p>
      <p begin="00:13:49.860" end="00:13:54.030">...globally replicated stores and push that agent inside the box...platform</p>
      <p begin="00:13:54.030" end="00:13:58.690">...constant communication with that agent to be able to give instructions in one case you can say hey</p>
      <p begin="00:13:58.690" end="00:14:01.450">...on the script right we actually take description actually</p>
      <p begin="00:14:01.450" end="00:14:05.900">send instructions down to the agent to be able to go to that work so it actually happens inside the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:05.900" end="00:14:11.650">vm and the our of this with...resource manager really is now</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.650" end="00:14:15.210">where you can express dependencies between these</p>
      <p begin="00:14:15.210" end="00:14:20.070">crypt files as well so you can actually say I have to be m I want to...between them but you can</p>
      <p begin="00:14:20.070" end="00:14:24.740">express a dependency their scripts to on vm to can take a...crypt one-on-one so</p>
      <p begin="00:14:24.740" end="00:14:29.640">you have in...configuration dependency that you can not just express on the infrastructure layer but now</p>
      <p begin="00:14:29.640" end="00:14:33.810">you're expressing dependencies between descriptive positive running across the different...now in</p>
      <p begin="00:14:33.810" end="00:14:37.880">...configuration of...just becomes a really simple so now you can express</p>
      <p begin="00:14:37.880" end="00:14:41.530">dependencies not just the infrastructure layer now you're expressing dependency surprise across the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:41.530" end="00:14:54.120">application layer between the different alignments and you are building complex applications on measure.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:54.120" end="00:14:57.530">Another key part above the new compute network and storage stack</p>
      <p begin="00:14:57.530" end="00:15:02.330">or the changes that we've done is also gone ahead and fundamentally looked at how do we want to</p>
      <p begin="00:15:02.330" end="00:15:06.410">expose networking to customers how do you want...bare-bones networking constructs</p>
      <p begin="00:15:06.410" end="00:15:11.210">...so the first thing that we've done is that earlier used to have the virtual machines would</p>
      <p begin="00:15:11.210" end="00:15:15.820">carry the networking configuration like, you know, I want to reserved ip or I want I want to endpoint for the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:15.820" end="00:15:21.240">...all of the networking...part of the virtual machine itself...broken apart we've really taken the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:21.240" end="00:15:25.630">lego blocks of networking and just started provisioning them so,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:25.630" end="00:15:30.200">going forward you'll have a network interfaces a first-class object to be able to attached to</p>
      <p begin="00:15:30.200" end="00:15:34.830">...so that's the first thing that you create and important part about the network interface here is that</p>
      <p begin="00:15:34.830" end="00:15:42.250">it's not it is a floating network interface when you actually delete vm it's actually not going to get</p>
      <p begin="00:15:42.250" end="00:15:47.140">deleted so the lifecycle of the networking configuration is actually separate from the virtual machine itself and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:47.140" end="00:15:50.490">the good part about this is when you do complex application configuration like, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:50.490" end="00:15:53.820">I want use security group a and then put it in virtual network</p>
      <p begin="00:15:53.820" end="00:15:58.050">be all of the configuration just stays with the version of with the network interface and including</p>
      <p begin="00:15:58.050" end="00:16:04.210">...so you can actually float the network interfaces around to the different virtual machines that you need and, load balance</p>
      <p begin="00:16:04.210" end="00:16:08.900">or this is one of the things that you used to offer as an implicit capability in the old model</p>
      <p begin="00:16:08.900" end="00:16:13.640">load balance is now first-class resource that allows you to define load balance of internal</p>
      <p begin="00:16:13.640" end="00:16:17.030">or public and then attach the net...to the load balance and say hey</p>
      <p begin="00:16:17.030" end="00:16:23.100">...the next I want to load balance as part of this load balance of so you get the flexibility of doing that and,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:23.100" end="00:16:27.950">another improvement that we've made is that on the virtual networking apis if you think about the existing</p>
      <p begin="00:16:27.950" end="00:16:33.530">models used to have a...based model...it was xml to them and if</p>
      <p begin="00:16:33.530" end="00:16:38.500">you had let's say ten virtual networks and subscription you had to toggle and operate using that single</p>
      <p begin="00:16:38.500" end="00:16:43.300">...xml...and actually thaler all...network into the virtual networks in the stack with</p>
      <p begin="00:16:43.300" end="00:16:48.160">improvements here now you get the flexibility of dealing with an operating only for a single virtual network</p>
      <p begin="00:16:48.160" end="00:16:53.140">and we've also added support for targeting individual virtual network through partial and, prospects</p>
      <p begin="00:16:53.140" end="00:16:58.260">...like...let's commands as well so which is it's very flexible and,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:58.260" end="00:17:03.600">we've also added support for public ip addresses we had support for this on the old stack as well but,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:03.600" end="00:17:08.600">...also added in the vtwo stack public ip...can be dynamic or static it can be assigned either to a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:08.600" end="00:17:13.170">...or to load balance and.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:13.170" end="00:17:16.640">The last one here is the network security groups are network security groups</p>
      <p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:20.970">offers both inbound and outbound rules we can actually goal filter based on a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:20.970" end="00:17:25.090">...the inbound rules that I want to set...public ip address or you can actually confident</p>
      <p begin="00:17:26.130" end="00:17:30.910">...as well ok so what are the notable changes in the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:30.910" end="00:17:34.800">apis...things that we havefundamentally changed we used to have something called</p>
      <p begin="00:17:34.800" end="00:17:39.870">...cloud service which offer a lot of these capabilities that's been modified to us</p>
      <p begin="00:17:39.870" end="00:17:46.240">...blocks really so the cloud...that it offered will used to offer us a public ip address</p>
      <p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:50.410">of that used to give and implicit load balance or it used to give...implicit concept called</p>
      <p begin="00:17:50.410" end="00:17:54.260">and availability set the networking configurations...to the virtual machines all of those</p>
      <p begin="00:17:54.260" end="00:17:59.040">...was so tightly coupled with...virtual machine and the object itself we've really broken</p>
      <p begin="00:17:59.040" end="00:18:02.040">them part given the lego blocks if you will and actually</p>
      <p begin="00:18:02.040" end="00:18:06.300">ask you guys to construct and actually make them stitch together the way that you things that I</p>
      <p begin="00:18:06.300" end="00:18:11.230">critical about it and we...lot of samples to make it easy for you to understand how this can be done</p>
      <p begin="00:18:11.230" end="00:18:15.730">and the samples include not just add the template level but also includes you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:15.730" end="00:18:17.720">goes from templates to</p>
      <p begin="00:18:17.720" end="00:18:22.600">...partial command let's two-c allies support including client libraries we've had</p>
      <p begin="00:18:22.600" end="00:18:27.890">...added support...samples for all of these different these so you can actually go to that.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:27.890" end="00:18:31.060">Another key part that I do want to mention here is that going forward in the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:31.060" end="00:18:35.350">...stack virtual machines need to be created...in a virtual network</p>
      <p begin="00:18:35.350" end="00:18:39.290">...you cannot create a virtual machine just by itself it has to be placed in...network is</p>
      <p begin="00:18:39.290" end="00:18:43.900">a security by default we...make sure that every virtual network...creator measure</p>
      <p begin="00:18:43.900" end="00:18:48.950">...a virtual network and you have to explicitly choose to say that you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:18:48.950" end="00:18:52.810">place...internet...creative em by itself it's not going to get and public</p>
      <p begin="00:18:52.810" end="00:18:58.260">...like before it gets secure by default.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:58.260" end="00:19:02.330">And, in you have to ask for public ip address and then you can float these ip addresses that you</p>
      <p begin="00:19:02.330" end="00:19:06.130">...so this is a big difference and what we're doing here?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:06.130" end="00:19:10.420">And, no, more implicit dns names you know, used to get something like something that lot-of</p>
      <p begin="00:19:10.420" end="00:19:13.700">...net if you don't want...you're like hey I don't care about it was just, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:13.700" end="00:19:18.650">added we don't provide that anymore if you want to dns name for your app you need to ask...unique</p>
      <p begin="00:19:18.650" end="00:19:23.560">...public ip address so if...have gone back to the basics of just saying how do we introduce networking how</p>
      <p begin="00:19:23.560" end="00:19:29.450">do we do networking as the basic building blocks and that's what we've solved the new apis.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:29.450" end="00:19:30.100">Okay,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:30.100" end="00:19:35.500">so, with that I'm going to hand-off to boris and talk a little bit about how we've simplify devon test</p>
      <p begin="00:19:35.500" end="00:19:43.020">...so how many of you use adrg iso devon test?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:43.020" end="00:19:46.040">How many of you have actually?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:46.040" end="00:19:47.930">Donner sharepoint deployment before</p>
      <p begin="00:19:49.270" end="00:19:52.390">...okay the reason why I bring that up like in</p>
      <p begin="00:19:52.390" end="00:19:57.340">a microsoft world one of the complexes...deployments or topology as well as</p>
      <p begin="00:19:57.340" end="00:20:02.790">...upon on from and ...what we're going to show what I'm going to show you today</p>
      <p begin="00:20:02.790" end="00:20:08.160">how simple it is so why do we think like the new virtual machine stagg</p>
      <p begin="00:20:08.160" end="00:20:12.340">...new measure stack has drastically simplified as your use iterative</p>
      <p begin="00:20:12.340" end="00:20:18.940">...so first of all when you build your or...days so</p>
      <p begin="00:20:18.940" end="00:20:24.330">I like to call it when you spun of your environment's and measure you probably road tons of partial</p>
      <p begin="00:20:24.330" end="00:20:29.480">scripts because you want to have an automated and repeatable workflow the problem</p>
      <p begin="00:20:29.480" end="00:20:34.000">of our shells scripts at least my experience of what we heard from customers is even though you</p>
      <p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:37.360">...if you want to another environment</p>
      <p begin="00:20:37.360" end="00:20:42.690">that's exactly like that the one that you spun up you run into issues more</p>
      <p begin="00:20:42.690" end="00:20:46.950">...on you need to debugged you need to figure out what's not working and things like that so</p>
      <p begin="00:20:46.950" end="00:20:52.080">it's really cumbersome to share like those our shells scripts of a configuration so</p>
      <p begin="00:20:52.080" end="00:20:56.960">...as a resource manager because we have a declarative way of describing an</p>
      <p begin="00:20:56.960" end="00:21:00.100">environment it's really nice and easy to repeat</p>
      <p begin="00:21:00.100" end="00:21:02.210">...deployments over and over again</p>
      <p begin="00:21:02.210" end="00:21:07.580">another important aspect and that's another big difference my hash mentioned that as a</p>
      <p begin="00:21:07.580" end="00:21:12.490">resource managers item potent that means like think about a partial scripts that you have to</p>
      <p begin="00:21:12.490" end="00:21:17.820">...you want to create a resource and you want to created...to check if the resource...and things like that</p>
      <p begin="00:21:17.820" end="00:21:19.850">...it was all an effort to put that</p>
      <p begin="00:21:19.850" end="00:21:24.180">code in there to check if the resource there and you need to catch it and you need</p>
      <p begin="00:21:24.180" end="00:21:28.210">...handle that situation so...resource manager being item</p>
      <p begin="00:21:28.210" end="00:21:32.800">coda and it's already build so you can think about you have a template to defines</p>
      <p begin="00:21:32.800" end="00:21:35.700">...you publish it or you deployed</p>
      <p begin="00:21:35.700" end="00:21:38.550">once you environment is there now</p>
      <p begin="00:21:38.550" end="00:21:43.850">you're going to repeat this deployment and you just make one change let's say you add another server to it as</p>
      <p begin="00:21:43.850" end="00:21:48.410">a resource manageable only...that additional server to it so that the</p>
      <p begin="00:21:48.410" end="00:21:51.220">sub the succeeding deployments are really fast because</p>
      <p begin="00:21:51.220" end="00:21:56.100">...changes are being impacted by the next employment that's really great?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:56.100" end="00:21:59.600">So, another another advantage of having everything</p>
      <p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:03.080">...one template is you basically can manage entire</p>
      <p begin="00:22:03.080" end="00:22:08.790">application as an entity before you had like I remember when I will like our transcripts</p>
      <p begin="00:22:08.790" end="00:22:12.700">...partial environment tons of scripture tama descriptive things like that</p>
      <p begin="00:22:12.700" end="00:22:18.420">...really hard to keep track of here with the template approach...have</p>
      <p begin="00:22:18.420" end="00:22:23.330">everything in one template and you can...you can source control it you can even track like once</p>
      <p begin="00:22:23.330" end="00:22:26.790">source controlled who may changes so you can really ensure that</p>
      <p begin="00:22:26.790" end="00:22:33.490">everything the entire application is managed as an entity the other aspect I mean I work on the</p>
      <p begin="00:22:33.490" end="00:22:37.820">visual studio side for us the way we think about it is configures code</p>
      <p begin="00:22:37.820" end="00:22:41.500">soulful obviously like a template because it's just a</p>
      <p begin="00:22:41.500" end="00:22:45.360">...file it can be easily integrated in are alike lifecycle tooling</p>
      <p begin="00:22:46.450" end="00:22:51.830">like continue is build and delivery pipeline release manager and the</p>
      <p begin="00:22:51.830" end="00:22:56.380">deaf test left that we have announce...so once you define your environment as a</p>
      <p begin="00:22:56.380" end="00:23:01.590">...blocks easily into our into our stack and if you don't use our stack</p>
      <p begin="00:23:01.590" end="00:23:06.040">it's also good because you can just use cdl high-power shell or any scripting language</p>
      <p begin="00:23:06.040" end="00:23:11.730">...deployed a template another advantage is really easy monitoring</p>
      <p begin="00:23:11.730" end="00:23:16.290">...because with...we...you get exactly actually you get a little</p>
      <p begin="00:23:16.290" end="00:23:21.830">bit more capabilities when it comes to monitoring and alerting so as my hash</p>
      <p begin="00:23:21.830" end="00:23:26.210">described there is this notion of extensions and there is a it's</p>
      <p begin="00:23:26.210" end="00:23:28.810">called actual diagnostics extension which is basically an</p>
      <p begin="00:23:28.810" end="00:23:33.730">...that runs on ibm's collects data about the machine...</p>
      <p begin="00:23:33.730" end="00:23:38.600">that run on top of it so you get that for free its easily to integrated and your application</p>
      <p begin="00:23:38.600" end="00:23:42.440">or you environment is being monitored and obviously you can also hook it into</p>
      <p begin="00:23:42.440" end="00:23:45.460">our alerting system.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:45.460" end="00:23:47.120">Another example</p>
      <p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:51.940">...or wide assist drastically simplified how many of you run a</p>
      <p begin="00:23:51.940" end="00:23:55.390">...test environment...to connected back to on from,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:55.390" end="00:24:01.280">for example, to get certain data so...that we also like make sure you have a good</p>
      <p begin="00:24:01.280" end="00:24:06.260">hybrid connectivity...thing you can use appoint...connection side-to-side or express</p>
      <p begin="00:24:06.260" end="00:24:11.140">...so it's really easy now with that because we talked a lot let's do the first</p>
      <p begin="00:24:11.140" end="00:24:17.230">...and back to here.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:17.230" end="00:24:22.120">Okay, everybody...okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:22.120" end="00:24:25.510">All right so what I have here is virtual studio but...not</p>
      <p begin="00:24:25.510" end="00:24:28.470">...studio code project whatsoever it's really</p>
      <p begin="00:24:28.470" end="00:24:32.590">just a template here it's called deployment template</p>
      <p begin="00:24:32.590" end="00:24:36.510">...jason and you can think about this template describes a</p>
      <p begin="00:24:36.510" end="00:24:40.810">very complex sharepoint form it has like a sharepoint front-end it has a</p>
      <p begin="00:24:40.810" end="00:24:44.950">...and app server and it has a database layer so think about</p>
      <p begin="00:24:44.950" end="00:24:48.500">it could be any topology like that very sophisticated</p>
      <p begin="00:24:48.500" end="00:24:52.000">topology of course I want to follower golden rules I don't want</p>
      <p begin="00:24:52.000" end="00:24:56.890">to start everything from scratch because if I needed to build...template from scratch would take me forever and</p>
      <p begin="00:24:56.890" end="00:25:01.000">it was probably like really hard to do so,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:01.000" end="00:25:06.420">my hash pointed out we have the get hub or them as a marketplace with all those templates</p>
      <p begin="00:25:06.420" end="00:25:11.480">...can go-there grab a template...needs use it put it in visual studio and</p>
      <p begin="00:25:11.480" end="00:25:15.750">customizing or someone in your company might already have defined</p>
      <p begin="00:25:15.750" end="00:25:21.320">...environment in a chase and template and you just elise to the sourceto the to ripple</p>
      <p begin="00:25:21.320" end="00:25:26.030">open it and you can start customizing so as I mentioned what I have here is</p>
      <p begin="00:25:26.030" end="00:25:29.680">...template and I don't want to dive into the tooling here</p>
      <p begin="00:25:29.680" end="00:25:32.300">but the nice thing about it is because it's</p>
      <p begin="00:25:32.300" end="00:25:36.460">a very complex template is we have a so-called chase</p>
      <p begin="00:25:36.460" end="00:25:41.610">an outline view so we don't want to build a designer anything like that we just want to give you an idea</p>
      <p begin="00:25:41.610" end="00:25:44.640">hey what resources what parameterization being used by</p>
      <p begin="00:25:44.640" end="00:25:48.830">...template and make it really easy for you to customizing so in here if</p>
      <p begin="00:25:48.830" end="00:25:53.520">I look at the resources I see I got quite a bunch here is like all my</p>
      <p begin="00:25:54.680" end="00:25:59.560">variables and my virtual machines and things like that and if I</p>
      <p begin="00:25:59.560" end="00:26:02.930">wanted to add something to a resource I could do that but just clicking</p>
      <p begin="00:26:02.930" end="00:26:07.410">at the resource and then I could bring up.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:07.410" end="00:26:09.000">The add new...dialogue</p>
      <p begin="00:26:09.000" end="00:26:16.100">...basically what it what it holds is a bunch of chase and snippets.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:16.100" end="00:26:18.540">And,...so</p>
      <p begin="00:26:18.540" end="00:26:23.100">...a bunch of chasing snippets that define artifacts in your environment so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:23.100" end="00:26:24.580">you could add another virtual machine</p>
      <p begin="00:26:24.580" end="00:26:28.910">...or another extension or another network</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.910" end="00:26:33.260">so as I mentioned before ready deployed the template to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:33.260" end="00:26:38.640">...just to prove it it's here it's basically sharepoint pharma</p>
      <p begin="00:26:38.640" end="00:26:45.190">measure deployed through visual studio so what I'm going to do now is ...here look at</p>
      <p begin="00:26:46.400" end="00:26:52.150">...template the snippet editor okay what I want to do now is I want to show you</p>
      <p begin="00:26:52.150" end="00:26:56.230">the item potency and what I've done here is I created a very simple</p>
      <p begin="00:26:56.230" end="00:26:59.990">low test that basically hammers the sharepoint</p>
      <p begin="00:26:59.990" end="00:27:05.420">website and because I haven't changed anything on my front-end I'm going to start deploying</p>
      <p begin="00:27:05.420" end="00:27:11.730">a template and you should see when we're in a portal that it's still excepting requests?</p>
      <p begin="00:27:11.730" end="00:27:14.980">Students let's run the test.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:14.980" end="00:27:19.770">...test is actually using...virtual studio testing service it's also cloud-based</p>
      <p begin="00:27:19.770" end="00:27:25.560">are not executing...locally because my machine wouldn't be what doesn't have to...to hold</p>
      <p begin="00:27:25.560" end="00:27:30.260">organizations right it's very easy to integrate only downside is it now needs to</p>
      <p begin="00:27:30.260" end="00:27:36.330">requires...resources will take all...should be fairly?</p>
      <p begin="00:27:37.390" end="00:27:39.960">While we.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:39.960" end="00:27:40.640">Configuring the</p>
      <p begin="00:27:40.640" end="00:27:44.500">agents why we start that I'm going to go and deploy.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:45.570" end="00:27:49.110">Via template.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:49.110" end="00:27:50.760">So, in here this is the deploy to</p>
      <p begin="00:27:50.760" end="00:27:54.630">resource group so there is no and again there is no</p>
      <p begin="00:27:54.630" end="00:27:58.620">...studio matching because what we used to deployed a template is really</p>
      <p begin="00:27:58.620" end="00:28:03.250">powerful it's a...that you can just use take</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.250" end="00:28:07.280">customize so it's what every id pro uses so there is no magic</p>
      <p begin="00:28:07.280" end="00:28:11.100">in visual studio whatsoever so in here I'm going to choose my subscription</p>
      <p begin="00:28:11.100" end="00:28:16.350">already have my resource group and then I just want to enter when I show you to paris meters because you</p>
      <p begin="00:28:16.350" end="00:28:20.370">see on the left-hand side in the chase and outline view I had quite a bunch of</p>
      <p begin="00:28:20.370" end="00:28:24.680">our meters but this is fairly, fairly convenient because it gives it</p>
      <p begin="00:28:24.680" end="00:28:29.280">a paradigm and you just need to add what you want what you want named resources</p>
      <p begin="00:28:29.280" end="00:28:42.740">spain so...and then kick-off...it?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:42.740" end="00:28:44.230">Little...so now</p>
      <p begin="00:28:44.230" end="00:28:49.030">...started and if we look down here.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:49.030" end="00:28:54.220">If everything goes well we hope.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:54.220" end="00:28:57.880">It basically has a template is valid so it's been validated by</p>
      <p begin="00:28:57.880" end="00:29:02.350">measure resource manager everything is good in a template then it starts creating</p>
      <p begin="00:29:02.350" end="00:29:08.400">a template deployment and then you should see any minute that the resource creation</p>
      <p begin="00:29:08.400" end="00:29:09.690">is fairly quick</p>
      <p begin="00:29:09.690" end="00:29:14.010">unique to think about is like virtual machines virtual networks and everything but this is</p>
      <p begin="00:29:14.010" end="00:29:18.010">really item potency it really goes in there and says okay already have that I haven't touched</p>
      <p begin="00:29:18.010" end="00:29:24.420">...has changed and basically just goes to the next step it starts</p>
      <p begin="00:29:24.420" end="00:29:26.870">answers availability...storage cones.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:28.140" end="00:29:30.600">Succeeded so,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:30.600" end="00:29:35.860">let's do one thing here as you can see like now it's really start</p>
      <p begin="00:29:35.860" end="00:29:40.120">going right hey I already have to research resource hasn't change go to the next one go</p>
      <p begin="00:29:40.120" end="00:29:45.580">to the next one and while it's doing that if we go in here that's</p>
      <p begin="00:29:45.580" end="00:29:50.580">the server explorer I can go to the sharepoint front-end</p>
      <p begin="00:29:50.580" end="00:29:55.260">click on configure which takes me to portal deep links into the portal we don't want</p>
      <p begin="00:29:55.260" end="00:29:58.450">to have any configuration staff and...studio because we really think</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.450" end="00:30:04.400">...portal or powerless right we to do that so we're going to take into poorly here.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:04.400" end="00:30:06.060">And, then you can see</p>
      <p begin="00:30:06.060" end="00:30:10.730">or sharepoint virtual machine is still running while...deployment is</p>
      <p begin="00:30:10.730" end="00:30:17.200">...and that's I think is really great especially for deft has scenarios.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:17.200" end="00:30:20.200">All right on with that I'm going to switch back to</p>
      <p begin="00:30:20.200" end="00:30:27.370">slide's but I think because most of you have already heard or seen about.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:27.370" end="00:30:29.620">Resent about tags.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:29.620" end="00:30:33.790">And, my hash already mention it I just want to point out a</p>
      <p begin="00:30:33.790" end="00:30:36.580">...things because the tagging.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:36.580" end="00:30:37.960">You think about tagging it's</p>
      <p begin="00:30:37.960" end="00:30:42.650">name value pairs that you can assign to resources are resource groups so not</p>
      <p begin="00:30:42.650" end="00:30:47.500">...test scenario that's pretty convenient because as my hash mentioned you can actually tag</p>
      <p begin="00:30:47.500" end="00:30:51.550">...and say this is my definite...that's my test environment but</p>
      <p begin="00:30:51.550" end="00:30:54.580">they're all the scenarios that I want to point out because there</p>
      <p begin="00:30:54.580" end="00:30:59.790">is like you get a pretty decent inside in your costing right because you can also</p>
      <p begin="00:30:59.790" end="00:31:03.950">tag by department you could say hey those resources are</p>
      <p begin="00:31:03.950" end="00:31:08.900">being used by the finance department those resources are being used by</p>
      <p begin="00:31:10.090" end="00:31:14.990">the engineering department and then you're building...to filter out...tax and you haven't manual of</p>
      <p begin="00:31:14.990" end="00:31:20.290">...the reason why mentioning that is because we also got a lot of complains about our billing system and it was hard to</p>
      <p begin="00:31:20.290" end="00:31:23.820">figure out who uses what resources...</p>
      <p begin="00:31:23.820" end="00:31:29.960">saying what the tagging is good for you could actually tag...jones who works in the as</p>
      <p begin="00:31:29.960" end="00:31:33.760">...resource manager very good example I just repeat that you could actually tag</p>
      <p begin="00:31:33.760" end="00:31:38.380">...resource worth responsible person for the resource for think about you have a</p>
      <p begin="00:31:38.380" end="00:31:43.260">measure mission critical application something goes wrong and you could actually just go to the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:43.260" end="00:31:47.580">...and say who should not contact here so those are just couple high-level samples</p>
      <p begin="00:31:47.580" end="00:31:53.050">...is great the next thing just one of briefly touch on is</p>
      <p begin="00:31:53.050" end="00:31:57.430">research spaced access control so I'm doing a lot of ev season</p>
      <p begin="00:31:57.430" end="00:32:01.720">redman up there about...test in a measure and the very first question we get</p>
      <p begin="00:32:01.720" end="00:32:03.940">okay how do I handle</p>
      <p begin="00:32:03.940" end="00:32:08.270">...subscription management because how should I do this with</p>
      <p begin="00:32:08.270" end="00:32:13.620">developers with my departments so on so forth so far you could only do it like</p>
      <p begin="00:32:13.620" end="00:32:18.510">on a subscription level and you had to add like other people in your department</p>
      <p begin="00:32:18.510" end="00:32:24.130">to subscription or each...its own subscription so with our bag</p>
      <p begin="00:32:24.130" end="00:32:28.750">you really have of at granularity permission control of</p>
      <p begin="00:32:28.750" end="00:32:32.650">...resources so you can basically say I want to give think</p>
      <p begin="00:32:32.650" end="00:32:38.080">about multi-layered application I only want to give a certain?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:38.080" end="00:32:40.000">Group of people access to my</p>
      <p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:44.830">...I just want to give a certain set of people access</p>
      <p begin="00:32:44.830" end="00:32:50.170">to my web front-ends servers and it goes even that...you could say I want to give</p>
      <p begin="00:32:50.170" end="00:32:55.790">the access to...I want to give them permission to certain actions so,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:55.790" end="00:33:00.750">for example, I could say okay I'm going to trust my hash to</p>
      <p begin="00:33:00.750" end="00:33:03.810">access my machine so he can remote desktop into it but</p>
      <p begin="00:33:03.810" end="00:33:10.220">I won't let him shut it down because I needed for demo so this is coming I think</p>
      <p begin="00:33:11.480" end="00:33:16.060">So, overall I think our...way of controlling access</p>
      <p begin="00:33:16.060" end="00:33:20.630">to your resources and we got that feedback from you over and over again and there</p>
      <p begin="00:33:20.630" end="00:33:27.280">...so thing it's really good I just want to skip over those two slides here because.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:27.280" end="00:33:31.340">Going to switch back to them.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:31.340" end="00:33:36.280">Right cool so I think that was a good introduction about how we can continue use you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:36.280" end="00:33:40.020">devon tester measure... using templates...new apis.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:41.040" end="00:33:45.670">What I'm going to focus a little bit on is the of data...a great story when,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:45.670" end="00:33:50.440">you know, the announcement of apis and template support now you have to models in which you can actually go</p>
      <p begin="00:33:50.440" end="00:33:55.120">...virtual...can actually say hey I'm going to define it using a template...app</p>
      <p begin="00:33:55.120" end="00:33:58.870">...apply that or you can use the old model the way you guys have done before</p>
      <p begin="00:33:58.870" end="00:34:03.300">to say I'm going to optimize own custom partial script is going to create using you actually in,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:03.300" end="00:34:06.300">for example, so, we will continue to support both models</p>
      <p begin="00:34:06.300" end="00:34:10.870">...support for template is really all about the ability where it makes it</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.870" end="00:34:15.500">easy for you to deploy an application now when you think so</p>
      <p begin="00:34:15.500" end="00:34:19.990">we talked a lot about first-time deployment now when you think about a greater update story you have</p>
      <p begin="00:34:19.990" end="00:34:24.470">the flexibility do whatever you want you can choose to say my deployment model and</p>
      <p begin="00:34:24.470" end="00:34:29.350">...management model that as you're going for is going to be all about templates because the templates...item...</p>
      <p begin="00:34:29.350" end="00:34:34.120">and all that you can do is you can actually go deploying app and say two months later you come back and say hey my perform of</p>
      <p begin="00:34:34.120" end="00:34:38.690">...and performance is not that great...I'm actually going to add a cashier and you want to bring a cashier with a</p>
      <p begin="00:34:38.690" end="00:34:43.300">couple more beams, for example, you just take the same template file...modify the temperate file to say</p>
      <p begin="00:34:43.300" end="00:34:47.160">had couple more ibm's just deployed again so your update</p>
      <p begin="00:34:47.160" end="00:34:50.520">...a great story can still be used...dom using the same...</p>
      <p begin="00:34:50.520" end="00:34:55.350">orange completely say hey I'm just going to use this for my first-time deployments and then use this out,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:55.350" end="00:35:00.120">you know, template but after the first-time deployments done online maintenance and management and for...updates like</p>
      <p begin="00:35:00.120" end="00:35:04.660">...added data...I want to change that gets all of that can done be done using existing</p>
      <p begin="00:35:04.660" end="00:35:08.850">tools introduce...and continue to use the...like tools and that's</p>
      <p begin="00:35:08.850" end="00:35:13.200">...absolutely update you so we all that we've opened up...another layer are model that</p>
      <p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:18.110">makes it simply the job simplified...end of the day you get the tools that you that used</p>
      <p begin="00:35:18.110" end="00:35:21.300">to exist before continue to manager which...the same way like you did</p>
      <p begin="00:35:21.300" end="00:35:26.890">before okay now the manageability in the debugging story</p>
      <p begin="00:35:26.890" end="00:35:32.040">is now is interesting as well because now you're triggering a template deployment it's going to run for like let's say,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:32.040" end="00:35:32.500">you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:32.500" end="00:35:38.090">half an hour one-hour right so...aspects of is actually very critical because let's say you</p>
      <p begin="00:35:38.090" end="00:35:40.890">...fifty-minute and durant app is dead so</p>
      <p begin="00:35:40.890" end="00:35:44.690">it's not very useful so we have added support at multiple levels we have</p>
      <p begin="00:35:44.690" end="00:35:49.170">supported the partial tooling we have...exploits the likely we have support in the portal for</p>
      <p begin="00:35:49.170" end="00:35:54.120">you to be exactly see what happened to a template deployment let's say you had ten resources that</p>
      <p begin="00:35:54.120" end="00:35:58.080">your spinning up you can actually go exactly look at van was the seventh resource that was fun up</p>
      <p begin="00:35:58.080" end="00:36:00.720">what was the error message you can actually have a fridge filter</p>
      <p begin="00:36:00.720" end="00:36:05.010">...shows you what happened we also support auditing like any other...you know, like we...</p>
      <p begin="00:36:05.010" end="00:36:09.900">of before auditing on the all of these operations so we store the data...nineties you can actually look at what</p>
      <p begin="00:36:09.900" end="00:36:16.800">happened during this time and another key part here that I do want to touch on is when</p>
      <p begin="00:36:16.800" end="00:36:20.840">you use resource groups and actually have a bunch of resources in some cases you have</p>
      <p begin="00:36:20.840" end="00:36:26.360">hb data like storage...a lot of...very helpful?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:26.360" end="00:36:28.510">Maximal deletion of resource could means that accident</p>
      <p begin="00:36:28.510" end="00:36:33.440">pollution of data so we support the capability of management...so you can actually go into resource</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.440" end="00:36:37.910">...locks and resources that doesn't have to believe that you can actually protect those resources from</p>
      <p begin="00:36:37.910" end="00:36:39.700">be deleted so when you actually try to read delete</p>
      <p begin="00:36:39.700" end="00:36:44.460">resource group all the other resource will go away but the ones that you had the management locks on will not be</p>
      <p begin="00:36:44.460" end="00:36:48.770">...we stuck patrol...looking at the large you'll be able to figure out saying I've</p>
      <p begin="00:36:48.770" end="00:36:53.060">...management lock on resource to ensure it doesn't get accidentally deleted so it</p>
      <p begin="00:36:53.060" end="00:37:00.040">is powerful of the same time you can make mistakes we provided the capabilities...you can...use the management...skip.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:00.040" end="00:37:04.850">And, we've also added support for resources...as a dot com today in the session I'm not going to go</p>
      <p begin="00:37:04.850" end="00:37:08.930">dive deep into it but do note that link the tree structure view</p>
      <p begin="00:37:08.930" end="00:37:14.280">all the entire subscription can actually go look at the just the data like it would</p>
      <p begin="00:37:14.280" end="00:37:18.720">just execute the get calls and all the resources and list to the tree structure view it's</p>
      <p begin="00:37:18.720" end="00:37:23.340">a very helpful very powerful tool especially if you're using the and extensions you can</p>
      <p begin="00:37:23.340" end="00:37:28.340">...authoring or developing scripts yang quickly look at what happened to might the output of my skip</p>
      <p begin="00:37:28.340" end="00:37:32.310">you don't have to go to partially don't have to go to see like you just run a template to quickly go</p>
      <p begin="00:37:32.310" end="00:37:38.790">...resources rasio dot com look at the vm and see what went wrong on the popular script executions...very powerful?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:38.790" end="00:37:41.740">Okay, so, let me switch here.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:42.810" end="00:37:52.750">To a quick demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:52.750" end="00:37:56.740">...able to see okay the front okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:56.740" end="00:38:02.650">Right so what I have here is which is to your code so, what I'm doing here is I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="00:38:02.650" end="00:38:07.290">have a deployment which is think of it is a scalable vector of I have a set of the m I've</p>
      <p begin="00:38:07.290" end="00:38:12.190">...as the front-end now I'm going to showcase an example that is how we</p>
      <p begin="00:38:12.190" end="00:38:16.620">have simplified the ability that you can now scale that web...in a very simple fashion so in</p>
      <p begin="00:38:16.620" end="00:38:21.480">the sample we're looking at a template which has the pedometer section so you know, the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:21.480" end="00:38:25.850">...templates of contains for important sections forces the parameters,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:25.850" end="00:38:30.830">parameters make a template repeatable more...more you parameterized more options you have or the flexibility that you</p>
      <p begin="00:38:30.830" end="00:38:35.110">...to repeatedly deploy that again and again the second section is the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:35.110" end="00:38:39.950">variable section mostly runtime constance that you can assign the third section is really the resources</p>
      <p begin="00:38:39.950" end="00:38:44.680">section resources are the set of resources that...spinning up for app classrooms outputs,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:44.680" end="00:38:50.060">outputs are used for looking at whether...operational successful or not so in this case you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50.060" end="00:38:54.490">I'm obviously, you know,...using password as...input storage account...input and</p>
      <p begin="00:38:54.490" end="00:38:59.470">...but the important part that I'd want you...note here is accepting of value call number of instances</p>
      <p begin="00:38:59.470" end="00:39:04.290">in this template the number of instances here I just said hey I want to go...up ibm's so</p>
      <p begin="00:39:04.290" end="00:39:10.640">that's important now after that instances a...resources action that I'm spinning up I'm speaking</p>
      <p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:15.400">of a storage account by my disks will be placed and creating virtual network there my...m will</p>
      <p begin="00:39:15.400" end="00:39:20.370">replaced now let's look at the public ip addresses so in this section...want you guys</p>
      <p begin="00:39:20.370" end="00:39:25.350">to focus on this aspect so what we have here is a new capability</p>
      <p begin="00:39:25.350" end="00:39:29.780">...copy capability inside the template language so what does offers is the capability</p>
      <p begin="00:39:29.780" end="00:39:31.090">where you can</p>
      <p begin="00:39:31.090" end="00:39:35.670">...this in a template file and actually asking to be executed and number of times so in the case</p>
      <p begin="00:39:35.670" end="00:39:40.280">...excepted that's...what this is going to do is actually going to create to public ip addresses</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.590" end="00:39:46.180">simon simultaneously because there are no dependencies and I can also use the capability called copy</p>
      <p begin="00:39:46.180" end="00:39:52.270">index which allows me to name the resources correctly so in this case what happens is the resource</p>
      <p begin="00:39:52.270" end="00:39:54.460">...be named...zero public ip one</p>
      <p begin="00:39:54.460" end="00:39:58.780">...and start creating that resource the good part is I can now extend the copy</p>
      <p begin="00:39:58.780" end="00:40:03.590">index capability to other resources as well so actually have the same thing here</p>
      <p begin="00:40:03.590" end="00:40:08.700">for network interface I'm saying here's the...and creating to network interfaces because I want</p>
      <p begin="00:40:08.700" end="00:40:13.070">...to virtual machines so you can continue to extrapolate that and then it keeps</p>
      <p begin="00:40:13.070" end="00:40:17.920">applying itself now another important part here is that I can also express dependencies between a</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.920" end="00:40:20.660">number of resources and creating so I created to public ip</p>
      <p begin="00:40:20.660" end="00:40:25.830">addresses and to mix I can also expressive dependency that says?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:25.830" end="00:40:29.750">My...zero actually depends on public ip zero so</p>
      <p begin="00:40:29.750" end="00:40:34.750">implicitly without actually having to go ahead and declare all of these instances again and again you have the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.750" end="00:40:40.300">capability to just, you know, implicitly specify here's...dependency so public near-zero</p>
      <p begin="00:40:40.300" end="00:40:45.240">...depends on public ip...being available...one depends on public ip one being available to express that</p>
      <p begin="00:40:45.240" end="00:40:50.350">dependency right here and the same applies for virtual machines I go and extend that...use that you've</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.350" end="00:40:55.300">...all over now what I have here is that I've already gone ahead and deployed this template with a couple of...</p>
      <p begin="00:40:55.300" end="00:41:01.970">so I'm just going to go...quickly show that so if you see this I actually have a couple of the m here.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:01.970" end="00:41:06.640">Medium zero...one with a couple of...ip is.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:06.640" end="00:41:11.370">Can also look at the scalable that...here and there a couple of instances of virtual machines</p>
      <p begin="00:41:11.370" end="00:41:14.570">...what I'm going to do is I'm going to quickly modify?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:15.840" end="00:41:20.590">I have a parameters file for this template...quickly modify this to say twenty so the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:20.590" end="00:41:27.050">simple click of changing this number I'm going-to go ahead and now start to deploy this.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:27.050" end="00:41:31.780">Whole thing so I'm doing a new actually subscript deployment into the scalable that</p>
      <p begin="00:41:31.780" end="00:41:36.700">...resource group I'm...that I'm giving the...of the parameter file that I just modified and the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:36.700" end="00:41:44.240">...to the template file the template file with the same template...used before.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:48.390">Disco make sure...</p>
      <p begin="00:41:48.390" end="00:41:55.570">Okay, all right.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:55.570" end="00:42:00.180">All right so these templates are posted on to addresses manager the template is valid...deployment is now</p>
      <p begin="00:42:00.180" end="00:42:05.750">being created in this case what happens is it now it's going to look at wait we mone and mtwo</p>
      <p begin="00:42:05.750" end="00:42:10.210">...up and running and the...asking for twenty more...so will automatically start provisioning</p>
      <p begin="00:42:10.210" end="00:42:14.650">the meaning eighteen the end...based on this template so it shows the item potency nature of</p>
      <p begin="00:42:14.650" end="00:42:19.230">a template it also shows the scalable nature of the stack so as you can see slowly the ip addresses</p>
      <p begin="00:42:19.230" end="00:42:27.090">will start getting created the network interfaces that are...on...start getting created.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:27.090" end="00:42:32.030">And, this is a key part not just purely from a deployment standpoint but also the fact</p>
      <p begin="00:42:32.030" end="00:42:38.090">that the scalability of the stack right previously if you wanted to go do this against</p>
      <p begin="00:42:38.090" end="00:42:42.980">...based apis you would have to wait a couple of minutes for equal to the next operation would not be able to add the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:42.980" end="00:42:45.490">gm's but improvement here really is around how we</p>
      <p begin="00:42:45.490" end="00:42:49.560">have fundamentally simplified the ability to go to this forced at the language</p>
      <p begin="00:42:49.560" end="00:42:53.760">level and template you can just do this by single change a number and also the underlying</p>
      <p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:42:59.880">...significantly improved to provide...capability for scaling up really fast.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:59.880" end="00:43:01.250">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:01.250" end="00:43:03.210">You can see these...are going to continue to run</p>
      <p begin="00:43:03.210" end="00:43:13.190">...ensure in shortness of time I'm going to jump back in again to the slide deck.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:13.190" end="00:43:18.260">So, the next part over going to focus onhow do we go about...complex applications now we just</p>
      <p begin="00:43:18.260" end="00:43:22.630">looked at a simple app that just, you know, the front...I had a website running there I just...it</p>
      <p begin="00:43:22.630" end="00:43:26.990">...not that big a deal sure we know we could do this using partial script but we simplify this using</p>
      <p begin="00:43:26.990" end="00:43:31.490">...manager but how do we fundamentally simplify complex right so one of the things</p>
      <p begin="00:43:31.490" end="00:43:35.230">that, you know, we've heard about you must have heard about it before but, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:35.230" end="00:43:39.740">we have support for a lot of the windows and linux workloads on the platform but,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:39.740" end="00:43:42.420">the key part and we have, you know, the tooling support</p>
      <p begin="00:43:42.420" end="00:43:47.730">...in configurations for but the important part here is now the work that you've done</p>
      <p begin="00:43:47.730" end="00:43:52.680">for application templates if you look at the bottom most part of it those are all the different apps</p>
      <p begin="00:43:52.680" end="00:43:58.030">...have templates for already longer dp or...containers and actually code deploying and app the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:58.030" end="00:44:03.270">...or...data stacks so we have real-world production application</p>
      <p begin="00:44:03.270" end="00:44:07.900">templates that are available right now for us to go on trial right previously if you had to go</p>
      <p begin="00:44:07.900" end="00:44:11.180">to this by yourself and if you want to architect this application it would take</p>
      <p begin="00:44:11.180" end="00:44:14.890">...take any like couple of weeks to just know what you need to do understand</p>
      <p begin="00:44:14.890" end="00:44:18.460">...different constructs but now what we've done is we've simplified the ability that these</p>
      <p begin="00:44:18.460" end="00:44:22.730">applications templates are available for you to go start from...actually just start from a</p>
      <p begin="00:44:22.730" end="00:44:25.260">...cluster...go look at all here's always been a</p>
      <p begin="00:44:25.260" end="00:44:29.850">...cassandra cluster you take that template back go...in a city modifications...</p>
      <p begin="00:44:29.850" end="00:44:37.030">that you want and then go deployed again so you get that flexibility from the platform and?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:37.030" end="00:44:39.630">The next part is.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:39.630" end="00:44:44.880">When you think about ...templates on this section what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you guys a little bit more insight into</p>
      <p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:50.810">what you need to think about when deploying...templates for your complex applications just</p>
      <p begin="00:44:50.810" end="00:44:55.950">...faults think of them and break them down into infrastructure...vm configuration pieces and,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:55.950" end="00:44:59.430">you break them down into infrastructure think of them as a what I'm an</p>
      <p begin="00:44:59.430" end="00:45:05.430">...the template for...just for a single production environment or I might architect...this for multiple and one</p>
      <p begin="00:45:05.430" end="00:45:08.340">...notion of doing this for like a deft devon</p>
      <p begin="00:45:08.340" end="00:45:11.610">...testament a product...what my different requirements how many of</p>
      <p begin="00:45:11.610" end="00:45:16.860">...do I need to...and each one of these different...if I were to use the same template again and again and,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:16.860" end="00:45:20.510">then for common application infrastructure...I'm going to show you a sample</p>
      <p begin="00:45:20.510" end="00:45:25.540">it would be a good idea to break them apart like...creating a single virtual network where the entire thing is going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:45:25.540" end="00:45:30.310">deployed I would recommend that you actually create a separate template just for the infrastructure pieces like</p>
      <p begin="00:45:30.310" end="00:45:34.470">creating a storage count operating the virtual network and leave the other pieces out</p>
      <p begin="00:45:34.470" end="00:45:39.620">and the other part is you can also leave...and configuration the separate template you can actually go</p>
      <p begin="00:45:39.620" end="00:45:44.560">...template that just is responsible for deploying the app and configuring the app let's among the</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.560" end="00:45:49.520">db or other apps right so you can keep separate template and obviously the multiple</p>
      <p begin="00:45:49.520" end="00:45:55.250">actually resources like, for example, if you're doing websites or...db keeping...gone ahead and deploy</p>
      <p begin="00:45:55.250" end="00:45:58.160">...created five or seven different templates now how do you go</p>
      <p begin="00:45:58.160" end="00:46:02.950">...them together so we have the capability in the platform template linking and I'll show you sample</p>
      <p begin="00:46:02.950" end="00:46:09.800">of that is actually going to go ahead and allow you to stitch all of these different template</p>
      <p begin="00:46:09.800" end="00:46:14.360">and express dependencies between them you can express dependencies between the not just</p>
      <p begin="00:46:14.360" end="00:46:19.140">...particles express dependencies between in the and aspects of it when you think about the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:19.140" end="00:46:22.310">indian configuration what I need to do inside the vm always think about</p>
      <p begin="00:46:22.310" end="00:46:26.330">architected in a way you take out and...apart the common</p>
      <p begin="00:46:26.330" end="00:46:31.160">...that you need to run across a bunch of nodes and actually have separate scripts for that and then do the app specific</p>
      <p begin="00:46:31.160" end="00:46:35.440">...as well so if I were to just think about this and look at,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:35.440" end="00:46:39.850">you know, try...diagram around it what you will have is you will have</p>
      <p begin="00:46:39.850" end="00:46:44.610">...you have to define the set of parameters that you want to plays or accept your template across different</p>
      <p begin="00:46:44.610" end="00:46:49.140">environments...test and...and then have a master template is responsible for actually going</p>
      <p begin="00:46:49.140" end="00:46:52.470">and deploying the whole app but knows how to call into the rights of apps</p>
      <p begin="00:46:52.470" end="00:46:56.360">...the dependencies I'll show you some samples that and have some</p>
      <p begin="00:46:56.360" end="00:47:01.310">logic or strategies for how you would place or except input from the use of that targets</p>
      <p begin="00:47:01.310" end="00:47:05.760">different alignments dev test...production and then have these different member resource templates</p>
      <p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:11.740">of shared resource templates when I say member resource these are templates that would be responsible for the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:11.740" end="00:47:16.490">blind the actual the m and stuff like that but...resource template more are on the infrastructure and storage</p>
      <p begin="00:47:16.490" end="00:47:21.970">counts and things that you need to go create and, in other cases the...could also be a website and,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:21.970" end="00:47:26.400">then the actual you can actually have a simple template that is responsible for spinning of singly</p>
      <p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:30.830">...and you can go ahead and use the looping capability to call it again and again you can accept the user</p>
      <p begin="00:47:30.830" end="00:47:35.360">input says...up seventy m...cassandra cluster but actually have a single</p>
      <p begin="00:47:35.360" end="00:47:41.430">bm setup clustered and then call it again and again sometimes to actually go...can architect doesn't...app from a single template</p>
      <p begin="00:47:41.430" end="00:47:45.610">...and then from the template file you can choose to...into the different extensions</p>
      <p begin="00:47:45.610" end="00:47:50.350">or the scripts themselves and say hey, you know, go called one of these basic script that are just pushed pull down</p>
      <p begin="00:47:50.350" end="00:47:55.810">...the muggy or the cassandra database specific, you know, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:55.810" end="00:47:58.300">exes...files and then run specific</p>
      <p begin="00:47:58.300" end="00:48:02.000">...to do configuration based on...that your...and for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:07.060">for the data in some cases the shatters templates could also choose...call-in to you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:07.060" end="00:48:12.770">the scripts themselves so in...in this example what I'm going to do is I'm going to talk a little bit about</p>
      <p begin="00:48:12.770" end="00:48:16.840">...app which we've built and it's available for us to go try is the data stacks</p>
      <p begin="00:48:16.840" end="00:48:21.220">on which machines we do so, datasets as an industry leader in developing and you</p>
      <p begin="00:48:21.220" end="00:48:26.160">know, delivering solutions based on apache cassandra right...it's and they have</p>
      <p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:30.810">two skews available they actually have a communities to available they also have a datasets enterprise skew available for</p>
      <p begin="00:48:30.810" end="00:48:35.410">...to guys to go use and...commercial advisory</p>
      <p begin="00:48:35.410" end="00:48:41.820">no sequel database right so, a we have we have quite a few customers of already started using cassandra on as</p>
      <p begin="00:48:41.820" end="00:48:46.640">...so what we're going to look at is how do we go spin up this and our cluster and measure is</p>
      <p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:51.270">going to look at how you can have this front-end or the...vm and then you can specify</p>
      <p begin="00:48:51.270" end="00:48:55.950">accept a set of input nodes are input vm from the customer and be able to spin up the entire data</p>
      <p begin="00:48:55.950" end="00:49:02.330">text cassandra cluster okay here's a quick view of what you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:02.330" end="00:49:07.200">when I walk through the template...when I go to the following...a bunch of these things I just want to give you a perspective and we</p>
      <p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:12.250">talked about the must attempted that's the as a deployed a json ...we talked about you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:12.250" end="00:49:14.750">breaking apart the different pieces you could think of the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:14.750" end="00:49:18.950">data that the cassandra nodes themselves that could be the ephemeral</p>
      <p begin="00:49:18.950" end="00:49:23.630">...you actually have a file the defines that specific configuration you have the...center vm with which</p>
      <p begin="00:49:23.630" end="00:49:28.700">you actually login monitor the entire datasets...that could be separate you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:28.700" end="00:49:33.690">json file I've all the also broken down the installation of the...configuration the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.690" end="00:49:38.130">ops intervene as a separate json...the extension from the script running inside the vm to configure</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38.130" end="00:49:42.910">...center is...faulty and actually break all of these different files and scripts themselves to go</p>
      <p begin="00:49:42.910" end="00:49:53.300">...run so let me go ahead and switch over?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:53.300" end="00:49:56.780">So,...earlier demo that I showed succeeded</p>
      <p begin="00:49:56.780" end="00:50:00.980">...important part...here is that if you actually see we started</p>
      <p begin="00:50:00.980" end="00:50:04.560">one eleven but one fifteen four minutes you</p>
      <p begin="00:50:04.560" end="00:50:10.370">get twenty virtual machine which is phenomenal different right so.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:10.370" end="00:50:16.050">All right let me jump back.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:16.050" end="00:50:20.830">Let me go here okay so.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:20.830" end="00:50:26.310">If you look at here's the ...pfizer folders that...that actually construct this data stacks</p>
      <p begin="00:50:26.310" end="00:50:29.810">of template so as I mentioned earlier we have a attribute deployed</p>
      <p begin="00:50:29.810" end="00:50:32.890">...some that's your master file and then you have the if</p>
      <p begin="00:50:32.890" end="00:50:36.750">...nodes which is the specific nodes that are the json files that are used for spinning up the data</p>
      <p begin="00:50:36.750" end="00:50:41.620">...the nodes and you actually have the...center resources start json which is actually</p>
      <p begin="00:50:41.620" end="00:50:44.590">...center configuration of the vm...the obstinate of</p>
      <p begin="00:50:44.590" end="00:50:48.810">...install resources of just running the customs crypt extension inside the which machine to configure</p>
      <p begin="00:50:48.810" end="00:50:54.830">...center so if you look at this template once again very similar you have the parameter section and</p>
      <p begin="00:50:54.830" end="00:50:59.610">...important part here with this template specifically is that accepts.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:59.610" end="00:51:03.060">Cluster node count this is the number of nodes that you want to specify the</p>
      <p begin="00:51:03.060" end="00:51:07.960">cassandra clusters it's very similar to the other template...used but here will be using a different strategy for actually going</p>
      <p begin="00:51:07.960" end="00:51:13.460">and applying such a complicated app so let's go back in here.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:13.460" end="00:51:18.610">First thing that I want to point out to you guys here is the resources section we have a model</p>
      <p begin="00:51:18.610" end="00:51:23.550">...I talked about how you can actually have different templates we have introduces model that you</p>
      <p begin="00:51:23.550" end="00:51:28.540">can have a template linking capability this...specifically here.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:28.540" end="00:51:33.200">This template linking capabilities what allows you to teach all of these different templates together to global</p>
      <p begin="00:51:33.200" end="00:51:38.070">...I to of app right so, we...passing the location of a template</p>
      <p begin="00:51:38.070" end="00:51:42.880">link here and say hey here's the location for this particular deployment which is the first one here is the</p>
      <p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:47.300">share template url which means that it's been of the virtual...accounts actually setting of the environment</p>
      <p begin="00:51:47.300" end="00:51:51.920">...the basic infrastructure...starting from there so that's the first template first deployments being</p>
      <p begin="00:51:51.920" end="00:51:56.620">skewered the second deployment here is the cluster nodes you're actually triggering the deployment of the cluster</p>
      <p begin="00:51:56.620" end="00:52:01.600">...specifically your creating let's say we start with the datasets cassandra cluster five nodes are seven nodes those</p>
      <p begin="00:52:01.600" end="00:52:07.370">are the nodes that will get created next so it's the cluster nodes template url and that gets created</p>
      <p begin="00:52:07.370" end="00:52:12.230">if you look at it actually...the note camp information...gets passed into five or seven or ten</p>
      <p begin="00:52:12.230" end="00:52:15.250">except that input and actually goes...create so many other nodes if</p>
      <p begin="00:52:15.250" end="00:52:20.200">you look inside that template that is actually going to create one virtual machine with a copy having seminar</p>
      <p begin="00:52:20.200" end="00:52:21.530">fighting...input.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:22.590" end="00:52:29.260">And, the last section is the ...center thing let me go back here.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:29.260" end="00:52:33.900">So, this is the actual quick...templates action that I talked about earlier so these this is the announcement</p>
      <p begin="00:52:33.900" end="00:52:37.180">...made if you actually go to...dot com go-to community and then go to the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:37.180" end="00:52:42.260">template section you actually land here these are the different templates that I talked about earlier so we have</p>
      <p begin="00:52:42.260" end="00:52:45.260">about sixty or seventy...templates and very,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:45.260" end="00:52:50.490">you know, application oriented templates as...we have caf...parkharden works cloud</p>
      <p begin="00:52:50.490" end="00:52:59.140">error data stacks all these different available on the platform let's go pick data stacks and...to.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:59.140" end="00:53:03.970">So, right from agile dot com you can actually go ahead and deploy this template into your subscriptions we can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:53:03.970" end="00:53:07.060">...see deployed...</p>
      <p begin="00:53:07.060" end="00:53:12.020">What this is going to do is it actually goes going-to-take the...on file and it's going to take it into the</p>
      <p begin="00:53:12.020" end="00:53:14.960">porta dot com parse the file and allow you to</p>
      <p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:19.260">...the parameters and actually go to apply this right into your subscription so that's what you're saying so</p>
      <p begin="00:53:19.260" end="00:53:22.850">now it is loading the whole template into the portal and</p>
      <p begin="00:53:22.850" end="00:53:27.600">it's going to generate a custom ui for you actually go and take the based on a number</p>
      <p begin="00:53:27.600" end="00:53:32.350">...we looked at like let's say all of these different parameters that we're looking at</p>
      <p begin="00:53:32.350" end="00:53:43.700">here will now be loaded up here in this template file will actually allow you to...this file in a single click?</p>
      <p begin="00:53:43.700" end="00:53:48.210">Yep, so, that template file is now directly loaded into the portal from a single click you have</p>
      <p begin="00:53:48.210" end="00:53:52.990">...you have the flexibility to go.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:52.990" end="00:53:55.670">Into the values for this...is the entire template file that we just looked</p>
      <p begin="00:53:55.670" end="00:54:06.160">at it actually has all the deployments I'm going to just go ahead and save it...edit the parameters.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:10.120">Is tanks...six-seven?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:10.120" end="00:54:14.130">School use that theme.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:14.130" end="00:54:20.300">Go ahead and get some parameters.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:20.300" end="00:54:22.340">Ethree.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:22.340" end="00:54:28.690">...up five of cluster.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:28.690" end="00:54:32.360">Perfect...existing subscription...create a...</p>
      <p begin="00:54:32.360" end="00:54:38.140">Research group.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:38.140" end="00:54:39.680">And,...pick.</p>

      <p begin="00:54:52.810" end="00:54:57.350">And, this is...so deploying data stacks and measure which used to be...a long</p>
      <p begin="00:54:57.350" end="00:55:02.230">processes fundamentally simplified...where you can just go from any of the existing templates you can</p>
      <p begin="00:55:02.230" end="00:55:07.550">just go start creating that deployment just not possible before so that's what we've done so,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:07.550" end="00:55:11.030">let's give it a minute I'll go back to show you the progress of the deployment but given</p>
      <p begin="00:55:11.030" end="00:55:15.030">interest of time I already have a data stacks such template that I was that</p>
      <p begin="00:55:15.030" end="00:55:18.580">I've already deployed so I'm going to just so many little bit the same</p>
      <p begin="00:55:18.580" end="00:55:23.740">five instance deployment I had created you can actually see...virtual machines here that's five data</p>
      <p begin="00:55:23.740" end="00:55:28.300">...notes and one of center node and I'm going to just want</p>
      <p begin="00:55:28.300" end="00:55:34.140">...to the here's the ops...write the network interface for the...if you look closely</p>
      <p begin="00:55:34.140" end="00:55:41.750">here's the public ip this for that vm and I'm going to navigate to show you the exact.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:41.750" end="00:55:48.540">Dns name so this is the...that we're going to...and look at the data stacks configuration.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:48.540" end="00:55:52.180">So, this right here is that location so it's data stacks.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:52.180" end="00:55:57.640">Which is six...about...com...with the single click what-you got was a five node data stacks</p>
      <p begin="00:55:57.640" end="00:56:03.560">cassandra cluster in just less than fifteen minutes which was not possible before so that's the our of</p>
      <p begin="00:56:03.560" end="00:56:05.910">the a single note the</p>
      <p begin="00:56:05.910" end="00:56:10.450">...manager integrated compute you can look at the nodes...actually look at what's happening</p>
      <p begin="00:56:10.450" end="00:56:29.130">in each one of those different nodes what's the running tasks all of this is possible which just a single click?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:29.130" end="00:56:31.180">Cool so,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:31.180" end="00:56:35.750">just kind of wrapping up the last part about this is all of these templates</p>
      <p begin="00:56:35.750" end="00:56:40.900">in the language that we talked about the apis themselves not just one template side but also the apis</p>
      <p begin="00:56:40.900" end="00:56:46.020">...tools and...partial commandments all of this is going to be consistent</p>
      <p begin="00:56:46.020" end="00:56:48.220">...I...consistent this is a single unify</p>
      <p begin="00:56:48.220" end="00:56:53.460">asher api stack that is going to be shipping with on...as well so the amount of</p>
      <p begin="00:56:53.460" end="00:56:56.930">the effort the code the anything that you any absentee build</p>
      <p begin="00:56:56.930" end="00:56:59.810">are right on top of the apis for the vtwo</p>
      <p begin="00:56:59.810" end="00:57:04.960">...is we to stack is going to be consistent so the same aps will actually work against a measure on</p>
      <p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:11.620">...as well and I'm going to give it back to...so you can actually do a quick demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:11.620" end="00:57:19.990">So, what do you guys things so far like...stove?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:19.990" end="00:57:25.850">All right sake of time as my hash mentioned by being consistent we truly</p>
      <p begin="00:57:25.850" end="00:57:29.990">means what you've seen here you will be able to do exactly</p>
      <p begin="00:57:29.990" end="00:57:33.990">the same thing on premises and jan on premises environment over</p>
      <p begin="00:57:33.990" end="00:57:40.320">time just to prove the point here that we are not just making that up I can</p>
      <p begin="00:57:40.320" end="00:57:44.590">show you work-in-progress right now switching back to.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:47.080" end="00:57:51.240">So, again, this visual studio I know it's hard and I assertions to look at</p>
      <p begin="00:57:51.240" end="00:57:55.980">virtual studio but it gets the point across thing so if I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:57:55.980" end="00:58:06.940">start with a new template...I could do that here hopefully.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:06.940" end="00:58:10.980">Click as a resource group and now you can think about you get this template selection</p>
      <p begin="00:58:10.980" end="00:58:14.270">...as I mentioned will integrate with get hop so you will be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:58:14.270" end="00:58:19.470">...down from get hub or from any other repository so let's check the</p>
      <p begin="00:58:19.470" end="00:58:24.320">virtual machine template for now just a very simple on and what you'll get</p>
      <p begin="00:58:24.320" end="00:58:29.540">is basically project I will show you before with...sharepoint template but the biggest difference and</p>
      <p begin="00:58:29.540" end="00:58:33.500">again that's work-in-progress the biggest difference now is that?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:34.550" end="00:58:41.640">If I'm going to go in here so here's my temperatures to set.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:41.640" end="00:58:46.120">This template now if I common here and say deploy create</p>
      <p begin="00:58:46.120" end="00:58:50.400">a new deployment so it's he's my account...sign-in with might be</p>
      <p begin="00:58:50.400" end="00:58:55.020">shown account but it also knows I have a on</p>
      <p begin="00:58:55.020" end="00:59:00.130">premise measure environment so I can come in here and say hey which</p>
      <p begin="00:59:00.130" end="00:59:05.670">...want to...that thing too you want to deployed into public...you want to deployed into the private</p>
      <p begin="00:59:05.670" end="00:59:10.410">...so here I'm going to choose private cloud.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:10.410" end="00:59:15.090">And, then...my subscription it knows it's actually pretty cool I think because I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:59:15.090" end="00:59:20.200">...with my idea...knows that I have access to private cloud lists dn</p>
      <p begin="00:59:20.200" end="00:59:21.780">...access to</p>
      <p begin="00:59:21.780" end="00:59:26.510">...resource groups and again there's no resource corbin there right now but I think you get</p>
      <p begin="00:59:26.510" end="00:59:30.550">to point so eventually at some point you will be able</p>
      <p begin="00:59:30.550" end="00:59:35.440">to take that very same template and just decide which environment you want</p>
      <p begin="00:59:35.440" end="00:59:38.140">to employed into and I think this is a really,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:38.140" end="00:59:43.350">really great story we have here and was that was really a very short demo</p>
      <p begin="00:59:43.350" end="00:59:49.500">...we just want to prove the point that we're working on that so.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:53.600" end="00:59:59.640">All right so in closing I think we wanted to get you guys...on the new</p>
      <p begin="00:59:59.640" end="01:00:04.400">...we to stack some of the...made not just the fact that it kiss come under</p>
      <p begin="01:00:04.400" end="01:00:07.660">as resource manager but also that...been fundamentally improvements and features that</p>
      <p begin="01:00:07.660" end="01:00:12.300">...been added we've gone back talk the talk a little more about the networking constructs</p>
      <p begin="01:00:12.300" end="01:00:15.640">...into the fundamentals broken down...lego blocks and</p>
      <p begin="01:00:15.640" end="01:00:20.590">aviv added phenomena more capabilities on the and extensions and how it integrates with reese's manager</p>
      <p begin="01:00:20.590" end="01:00:25.280">...actually go build and app think of apps more than the infrastructure that was the</p>
      <p begin="01:00:25.280" end="01:00:28.340">goal...so much...moi?</p>
