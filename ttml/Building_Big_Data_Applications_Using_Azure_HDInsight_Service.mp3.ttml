      <p begin="00:00:03.850" end="00:00:07.540">Hello, everyone thanks for coming I'm a silicon I'm a</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.540" end="00:00:09.970">...program manager in the big data team</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.970" end="00:00:14.470">in as your time join here with tim I'm tim bedrock I'm a</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.470" end="00:00:19.560">technical evangelist based out of chicago so thanks everyone for coming I know it's six thirty</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.560" end="00:00:25.930">in the evening and having some amazing session throw diving attending as well and I know</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.930" end="00:00:31.150">there's a party right after this so I really appreciate people who came</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.150" end="00:00:37.660">The...itself isbig data and actually there's a lot to cover normally like at</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.660" end="00:00:41.850">this big data has lot-of technologies in there and v coverage in like</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.850" end="00:00:43.780">...for sessions.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.780" end="00:00:46.510">And, I was I was telling</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.510" end="00:00:51.870">the that organizer like oy so I have one-hour to cover and you're like, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.870" end="00:00:55.010">don't worry that people who come for build has really high iq and I said</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.010" end="00:00:57.850">mom I can by that?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.850" end="00:01:01.980">So, if I stream through the dec...you don't understand</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.250" end="00:01:10.660">the demo then you don't fit in his definition but...just following</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.660" end="00:01:17.430">his definition so what I have is like literally like seven eight slides in this</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.430" end="00:01:22.140">...to set of the context and the idea is that we go</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.140" end="00:01:26.790">and build actual apps end-to-end over here?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.790" end="00:01:30.720">And, the and the daggers...literally have not go into too much</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:36.820">depth and there are some topics I will just mention but, I will try to covered most of the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:36.820" end="00:01:46.540">ones which we will using the demo itself okay so...that get started.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.540" end="00:01:51.320">I think this is like there's a variable do the check in terms of like maybe I'm just.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.320" end="00:01:56.150">Visiting my thirty seconds because we've already noise so how many people are familiar with the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.150" end="00:02:01.740">with big data...do this whole ecosystem...using it.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:04.610">Ogre...spend thirty seconds so,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.610" end="00:02:10.290">basically the question is like why do we care about the big data right so</p>
      <p begin="00:02:10.290" end="00:02:14.680">like data has been there forever and there have been some awesome technologies both build</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.680" end="00:02:18.090">...microsoft and out and, other companies which is like whether</p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.090" end="00:02:22.150">it is relational store or whether it is like for biif</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.150" end="00:02:25.800">annals a analytics for each dl so what</p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.800" end="00:02:28.290">...what changed and why suddenly there</p>
      <p begin="00:02:28.290" end="00:02:33.610">is so much hype around like a big data and all of that I think it is less about like</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:38.365">it's not just about like what you want to goal and do with the data I</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.365" end="00:02:42.950">think like that the primary thing that changes the type of the data and how it</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.950" end="00:02:46.790">is being generated so of course the volume</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.790" end="00:02:49.920">changed like now everyone wants to send some</p>
      <p begin="00:02:49.920" end="00:02:55.630">...somewhere and, producing lots and lots of data and it is also about</p>
      <p begin="00:02:55.630" end="00:02:59.700">...the speed the data is being produced and as a result people are becoming</p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.700" end="00:03:05.130">...data-driven that literally like last month I was talking</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.130" end="00:03:10.190">to some executives from some fromcompany and they do...they have</p>
      <p begin="00:03:10.190" end="00:03:15.100">retail stores and it's not like a website they have like physical retail stores and they were like</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.100" end="00:03:19.880">also if we if during this sales season if my store opens on</p>
      <p begin="00:03:19.880" end="00:03:23.680">the east coast like by the time the time comes for the vest</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23.680" end="00:03:27.900">post can I'm going to get some analytics so I can I can read a range</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.900" end="00:03:33.260">staff and the physical store and all that like wow really so basically like you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:33.260" end="00:03:37.550">get the data from the registers as people are buying stuff sanded</p>
      <p begin="00:03:37.550" end="00:03:42.430">into the cloud analyze it you have your data size people ahead of time...be</p>
      <p begin="00:03:42.430" end="00:03:47.260">define some models which can be used put it into a biif and have your business</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47.260" end="00:03:52.240">decision-makers look at it and call someone on the rest vesco so they can be can</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52.240" end="00:03:57.430">...something physically wow that's impressive so basically it's also about like time to insight</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.430" end="00:04:03.280">and then again the ...the for thing is about like the type of the data is becoming is</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:07.790">not generated because it is...define schema and everything because</p>
      <p begin="00:04:07.790" end="00:04:12.480">...is easy to when process downstream like all varying type of data is</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:17.620">generated like even in microsoft like when we go and analyze the data which is</p>
      <p begin="00:04:17.620" end="00:04:22.300">coming from the support calls like that is literally the guy on the phone and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:22.300" end="00:04:26.650">he's typing...as someone who's calling and saying like I have this issue like icon</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.650" end="00:04:31.190">research my password and this and that and like the guys capturing all of that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:31.190" end="00:04:35.250">...there and they are they want to get that data maybe one hundred thousands of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:35.250" end="00:04:40.170">calls and do machine learning on it so you have to would to organize it you have to analyze</p>
      <p begin="00:04:40.170" end="00:04:45.030">...a different way and again the scale is big I want to...throw the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.030" end="00:04:49.280">year how many calls have...in what was the primary reason I want to go</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:54.150">and classify it I want to label it I want to model it so the challenges are becoming really,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:54.150" end="00:04:56.800">really interesting and that's where the whole big data</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:05:02.050">and the new set of technologies comes in so even primarily talk about</p>
      <p begin="00:05:02.050" end="00:05:07.010">...so again because the data itself is a huge topic and there's a lot in it and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.150" end="00:05:09.340">...results again</p>
      <p begin="00:05:09.340" end="00:05:14.310">...of a decade back and ...how do...like I have to really, really, really,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:14.310" end="00:05:19.240">really simplify this slide because if you go and look at some of the...slides out on the web it because</p>
      <p begin="00:05:19.240" end="00:05:23.560">it's an open-source technology they talk about large of other stuff so,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23.560" end="00:05:25.280">there's a reason I like...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:25.280" end="00:05:30.000">made it very simple are there are three things there is batch which I'm going to talk about there is no</p>
      <p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:34.050">...store which is h base I want to talk about and there's a streaming solution which is</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.050" end="00:05:38.430">stall and these are all the technologies that come under them</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.430" end="00:05:42.810">...hd insight which is the big data service on and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:44.620" end="00:05:49.750">I will take one by one and give you an introduction and then I will show you in the code of what you can go and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:49.750" end="00:05:51.370">do with that?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:51.370" end="00:05:57.200">So, how as I said...is the aggregate offering what they do is that they take</p>
      <p begin="00:05:57.200" end="00:06:03.120">...brought the...which has been done outside which is which is how do it's not that my</p>
      <p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:05.480">...is not contributing their microsoft another big</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.480" end="00:06:10.190">enterprises your contributing but they all go back into the into the main trunks everyone else</p>
      <p begin="00:06:10.190" end="00:06:16.710">...benefit this has a lot like in terms of the velocity</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.710" end="00:06:21.190">...which you can develop and the number of the reviews that you get on the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:21.190" end="00:06:26.360">...itself like this has been amazing for us to go and take a back on this</p>
      <p begin="00:06:26.360" end="00:06:30.650">open-source...platform so some of the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:30.650" end="00:06:33.800">can like question that come to me is like so,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:33.800" end="00:06:38.170">this is how do like if I go to the apache trunk how's that different than what I get on</p>
      <p begin="00:06:38.170" end="00:06:42.940">...there's a lot of differences one is that there's not change like we don't change the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:42.940" end="00:06:46.130">...if you add something we added back into the trunk but the key</p>
      <p begin="00:06:46.130" end="00:06:52.740">things are that it is fully managed so I don't know like how many people have</p>
      <p begin="00:06:52.740" end="00:06:57.030">...about big data like pick any book from...anywhere like first each represent how</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57.030" end="00:07:00.170">...set of your cluster because it is so hard to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:00.170" end="00:07:06.040">set of these clusters so the first thing you will get is that and...you go in and you say I want I want</p>
      <p begin="00:07:06.040" end="00:07:10.490">...I one-star my one how do and I want to five hundred more cluster and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.490" end="00:07:15.060">...in fifteen minutes you have a five hundred node cluster all set of for you and it's</p>
      <p begin="00:07:15.060" end="00:07:19.520">not just scripts because even if a single node goes down it is a</p>
      <p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:24.810">us who will wake up and fix it for you so it is fully manage service so we provide</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.810" end="00:07:27.500">you nsa lay-offs ninety nine-point nine up</p>
      <p begin="00:07:27.500" end="00:07:32.150">percent up time so you don't have to go and worry so these are the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:32.150" end="00:07:39.820">two big points which people don't understand if they just say this is an open-source thing which</p>
      <p begin="00:07:39.820" end="00:07:45.790">we are offering the third thing is that the understand our customers we understand</p>
      <p begin="00:07:45.790" end="00:07:49.890">...more...customers...enterprises we know that many of those have</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.890" end="00:07:55.030">of spender lies building applicationsin dot net and as, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:55.030" end="00:07:59.580">most of these open-source technology...support dot net or they don't have any binding into the into</p>
      <p begin="00:07:59.580" end="00:08:03.860">the visual studio...for the development environment and that's...we go in and</p>
      <p begin="00:08:03.860" end="00:08:08.350">we really invest...invest in the productivity we want to make sure that people</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08.350" end="00:08:13.050">who are who have been familiar with microsoft tools with gs and others they can go in</p>
      <p begin="00:08:13.050" end="00:08:16.460">the use these you want to make sure that if you are writing your next</p>
      <p begin="00:08:16.460" end="00:08:21.390">in js application or your for your windows phone or for your for tablet you can</p>
      <p begin="00:08:21.390" end="00:08:26.340">go and connected these technologies and all the bindings that api and dot net</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.340" end="00:08:31.290">libraries are idea for you to build but at the same time if you want to be the one who</p>
      <p begin="00:08:31.290" end="00:08:35.860">...in scholar and enclosure and java like...all work as well</p>
      <p begin="00:08:35.860" end="00:08:41.740">actually like the even do some work to make that one easy as...so that is like the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:41.740" end="00:08:45.260">key...prob that we provided that is what like</p>
      <p begin="00:08:45.260" end="00:08:48.240">...ideas a-z site is the big data offering on</p>
      <p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:55.280">as so you can go and build your applications on top of on top of these clusters?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:55.280" end="00:09:00.670">So, three slides the last two slides one for each of the first one is five of</p>
      <p begin="00:09:00.670" end="00:09:05.720">...talk about...is a query language literally you goal of</p>
      <p begin="00:09:05.720" end="00:09:09.940">...you go in and you start putting your data and agile very typical scenario I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.940" end="00:09:14.410">talking about either your data is just is born in the cloud...your data</p>
      <p begin="00:09:14.410" end="00:09:19.880">is being generated from your io devices or somewhere and you throw it into the cloud</p>
      <p begin="00:09:19.880" end="00:09:25.530">...they basically one example is like a while one of the companies like just giving...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:25.530" end="00:09:30.260">are there you...based company they do for charities and all of that they</p>
      <p begin="00:09:30.260" end="00:09:35.840">did an awesome project they took all of their data put it in the cloud and</p>
      <p begin="00:09:35.840" end="00:09:39.010">they build a...in...off like how people are related and,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:39.010" end="00:09:44.200">what are the...what are the places...give charities in which organizations and in</p>
      <p begin="00:09:44.200" end="00:09:49.410">this case like they were able to come up with this very interesting insights and they even have a case studies so</p>
      <p begin="00:09:49.410" end="00:09:55.270">...you are being...google for it just giving yean site you will find the case study so</p>
      <p begin="00:09:55.270" end="00:10:00.110">very interesting stuff people have done with it so the basic concept is that the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:00.110" end="00:10:06.400">high of is a very powerful query language ...can create a table and when I say create</p>
      <p begin="00:10:06.400" end="00:10:10.110">a table like the one difference you see is that in the big data into</p>
      <p begin="00:10:10.110" end="00:10:15.410">...the old-style like basically you define the schema first and then you</p>
      <p begin="00:10:15.410" end="00:10:20.690">write it in the...data world you right first and then you define the schema and that</p>
      <p begin="00:10:20.690" end="00:10:25.130">sleight change changes the...you handle with data because once</p>
      <p begin="00:10:25.130" end="00:10:30.120">venue are storing the data you don't need to worry about what I will...do with it</p>
      <p begin="00:10:30.120" end="00:10:34.420">...be the questions I will ask how...relations should be defining anything like all you do</p>

      <p begin="00:10:38.890" end="00:10:43.640">...your laws or the streams...coming from diode you just keep the storing that?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:43.640" end="00:10:47.770">And, then when the time...you want to go and do something you define the table and then you</p>
      <p begin="00:10:47.770" end="00:10:50.920">...writing your kuwaitis the second one is age</p>
      <p begin="00:10:50.920" end="00:10:55.250">...is bases and, also store it gives you a really,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:55.250" end="00:11:00.090">really, really fast read and write access like, for example,...facebook, facebook messaging</p>
      <p begin="00:11:00.090" end="00:11:04.190">...it's built on each base like millions of people are going in there and they will</p>
      <p begin="00:11:04.190" end="00:11:08.080">...look at the messages will...they will righted the redid</p>
      <p begin="00:11:08.080" end="00:11:13.180">...uses a lot in age base for their stuff so it's a really,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:13.180" end="00:11:16.440">really powerful store that you can go and</p>
      <p begin="00:11:16.440" end="00:11:20.440">...your data and then build application on top of it and this is one of the stores that</p>
      <p begin="00:11:20.440" end="00:11:26.860">people use today to build the application the last one is strong its</p>
      <p begin="00:11:26.860" end="00:11:32.410">user for streaming the one thing which I want really of one beautiful classes the is the</p>
      <p begin="00:11:32.410" end="00:11:38.030">...box and, the thing which is in there is...topology...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:38.030" end="00:11:39.140">...you will hear a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:11:39.140" end="00:11:44.450">...the next forty-five minutes is topology and apologies made of</p>
      <p begin="00:11:44.450" end="00:11:49.320">spouting...so that's what it shows it's seems like the water's coming into the</p>
      <p begin="00:11:49.320" end="00:11:54.360">actually the data is coming in so you write...spout which is a connector so you go and you connect to</p>
      <p begin="00:11:54.360" end="00:11:58.540">a source what is your source data coming from your device coming from your</p>
      <p begin="00:11:58.540" end="00:12:03.180">...coming from your computer...from your phone coming from</p>
      <p begin="00:12:03.180" end="00:12:07.010">the twitter stream anything that is your spouse so basically you're</p>
      <p begin="00:12:07.010" end="00:12:12.170">spouse available for many of the things which are out there and then you do your business operations</p>
      <p begin="00:12:12.170" end="00:12:17.170">I want...doing of...in function I want...in...I want to...redid from</p>
      <p begin="00:12:17.170" end="00:12:22.020">...age base anything and those are the...so the reason I'm spending an extra minute on it is like</p>
      <p begin="00:12:22.020" end="00:12:28.200">...you build application we will be doing a lot so let me go and, a spout for this data</p>
      <p begin="00:12:28.200" end="00:12:33.260">source or...will go and add this...which does this thing and then together they</p>
      <p begin="00:12:33.260" end="00:12:40.100">...topology ok so just...talk about this one of the one of the scenarios</p>
      <p begin="00:12:40.100" end="00:12:45.060">...are working very closely with one of the big automobiles in</p>
      <p begin="00:12:45.060" end="00:12:50.530">us and later this year they...with one of the brands...they</p>
      <p begin="00:12:50.530" end="00:12:56.020">have built a really, really interesting disconnected carson...and again,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:56.020" end="00:13:01.640">this is much simplified than what it is there but, the idea is similar we're like the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:01.640" end="00:13:06.440">...keep sending data and you can do a lot of interesting scenarios including the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:06.440" end="00:13:09.640">preventive...maintenance so they look at the data coming from the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:09.640" end="00:13:14.590">sensors the outside temperature how the current has been behaving...they have already loaded</p>
      <p begin="00:13:14.590" end="00:13:19.480">lot-of their data in the store so they do a join so it's like when was this</p>
      <p begin="00:13:19.480" end="00:13:24.550">car came in for the last check-up and all of that so basically based on that they have</p>
      <p begin="00:13:24.550" end="00:13:27.260">...a very nice end-to-end</p>
      <p begin="00:13:27.260" end="00:13:30.320">...scenario and in terms of the technologies the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:35.310">...the one which data game-like agile provides you alteration so you can slapping and...</p>
      <p begin="00:13:35.310" end="00:13:40.700">about different type of stores and all of that is some of the one which I displayed here like</p>
      <p begin="00:13:40.700" end="00:13:44.210">again, storm is the one which is the pipeline of how the data</p>
      <p begin="00:13:44.210" end="00:13:49.400">slowing and then you can do multiple operation in india ok so</p>
      <p begin="00:13:49.400" end="00:13:55.800">...of talking...things in mind big data has the capability to query to</p>
      <p begin="00:13:55.800" end="00:13:57.780">...it has...also...which</p>
      <p begin="00:13:58.800" end="00:14:03.230">...streaming pipeline which is which is called the storm and then in there you</p>
      <p begin="00:14:03.230" end="00:14:06.420">build the topology is vcr...off the spouse</p>
      <p begin="00:14:06.420" end="00:14:16.560">...ok so let's switch to demo?</p>
      <p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:24.220">Okay, so, I have a visual studio here I will startwith...with a new project.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:24.220" end="00:14:29.090">in their you will notice that...in as part of the templates that get shipped are there is a</p>
      <p begin="00:14:29.090" end="00:14:34.210">...site in there and what this allows you is that it gives you the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:34.210" end="00:14:38.930">...you don't have to worry about the dependencies you don't even have to worry about like</p>
      <p begin="00:14:38.930" end="00:14:42.470">...do I what is the interface that I need to add for my spout and</p>
      <p begin="00:14:42.470" end="00:14:45.650">...it will give you an empty spouting...bold and</p>
      <p begin="00:14:45.650" end="00:14:50.610">an empty topology which are connected so that is the advantage you get so one thing which I did was</p>
      <p begin="00:14:50.610" end="00:14:55.640">actually I wanted that if someone wants to follow us along they can do it so every</p>
      <p begin="00:14:55.640" end="00:14:59.750">code which I'm doing I have put it...online galley we hope to clean it up and also</p>
      <p begin="00:14:59.750" end="00:15:04.270">ship it as part of the vs so if you go to the to the online one and then search</p>
      <p begin="00:15:04.270" end="00:15:08.240">...here and then search for let's say hd</p>
      <p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:17.150">inside one-click...thank you?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:17.150" end="00:15:18.980">So, you will get this the starter</p>
      <p begin="00:15:18.980" end="00:15:24.090">...template the so...for this one and this one agnes and online...so you can all</p>
      <p begin="00:15:24.090" end="00:15:31.670">get it what this does is that let me just call it?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:31.670" end="00:15:37.170">Demo build.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:37.170" end="00:15:41.830">So, this gives you the same scaffolding plus little more and what it does is that</p>
      <p begin="00:15:41.830" end="00:15:46.750">also demanding brainstorming in terms of like up what is the demo we do in and,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:46.750" end="00:15:51.160">it does the source of the stream does not make a huge difference and then you...</p>
      <p begin="00:15:51.160" end="00:15:56.030">connect to some stream...just coming from your device...is coming from anywhere so</p>
      <p begin="00:15:56.030" end="00:16:00.760">what we thought was that it would be interesting if we can pick if you connect...twitter because...that and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:00.760" end="00:16:06.020">give-me continuous stream and then we can go and analyze it will be much more readable</p>
      <p begin="00:16:06.020" end="00:16:10.900">then if I tell you that this...thing which is coming is from the device and trust me it</p>
      <p begin="00:16:10.900" end="00:16:16.310">is real or something so this gives you more readable stuff that comes in so, as</p>
      <p begin="00:16:16.310" end="00:16:21.380">a result what we have is remember the spouting...discussions so it has one spout and one</p>
      <p begin="00:16:21.380" end="00:16:24.240">...if you click on the spout</p>
      <p begin="00:16:24.240" end="00:16:32.100">basically it uses the I will build it so that it resolve the dependencies it uses the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:32.100" end="00:16:37.970">treat I envy which is an object...by as it is one of the csharp libraries to go and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:37.970" end="00:16:43.650">...like...like you can use it in your any dot net application there are many other</p>
      <p begin="00:16:43.650" end="00:16:48.170">...libraries out there you can use any real quick I think that's highlights the our of when you're</p>
      <p begin="00:16:48.170" end="00:16:53.160">building a csharp application of your connecting to a source and, you know, how to connect to it because you</p>
      <p begin="00:16:53.160" end="00:16:57.840">built, you know, you...the worker role you build something already you can leverage that a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:16:57.840" end="00:17:04.600">that existing code and that knowledge you have right here in your in your topology yep so,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:04.600" end="00:17:08.080">basically, yeah, so, you can pretty much use any library so if you are, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:08.080" end="00:17:13.560">you are writing to sql you can you...not in this algorithm...you use it so,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:13.560" end="00:17:15.200">in there you come in and</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.200" end="00:17:19.250">...this library requires you to say what are the hash tags you are looking</p>
      <p begin="00:17:19.250" end="00:17:24.080">for so in the template avi just...coffee and nhl you can change it</p>
      <p begin="00:17:24.080" end="00:17:28.900">you can say like I'm looking for build two thousand and fifteen</p>
      <p begin="00:17:30.340" end="00:17:37.650">and I can make some more variations of this I can say?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:37.650" end="00:17:38.750">Build.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:38.750" end="00:17:45.660">And, then this one as.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:45.660" end="00:17:50.340">An looks good that's good okay so now it will go and look for these two</p>
      <p begin="00:17:50.340" end="00:17:55.210">issues are coming in but it connects using my developer api that is the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:55.210" end="00:17:59.500">one which I did not share...so you get your on us but I will go</p>
      <p begin="00:17:59.500" end="00:18:03.660">and add...very quickly so you...quality it get your</p>
      <p begin="00:18:03.660" end="00:18:09.820">cameras writing on it so we're here you go and see if</p>
      <p begin="00:18:09.820" end="00:18:15.660">and close so, I put in my...developer key in there so now I can use that develop</p>
      <p begin="00:18:15.660" end="00:18:17.710">...to google...to twitter.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:19.380" end="00:18:24.300">There is nothing else so this pretty much is basically does next to each</p>
      <p begin="00:18:24.300" end="00:18:25.800">which comes in it adds to the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:25.800" end="00:18:31.170">q and then when it says next apple again this is a deeper topic in terms of in spout</p>
      <p begin="00:18:31.170" end="00:18:35.400">...is one method which is the most critical which is next...and</p>
      <p begin="00:18:35.400" end="00:18:41.540">...as soon as it has process one event it will automatically call next double for the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:41.540" end="00:18:46.220">next one and it continuously keep doing it a very fast rate?</p>
      <p begin="00:18:46.220" end="00:18:50.090">So, basically when this happens the big the one from the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:50.090" end="00:18:57.020">...which is a local in memory and then send you the next one as I said there is this was the spout</p>
      <p begin="00:18:57.020" end="00:19:02.650">then there is a...doesn't do anything other than that says this is the schema and it puts</p>
      <p begin="00:19:02.650" end="00:19:07.730">...method in the addresses execute tweet and this is for you to go</p>
      <p begin="00:19:07.730" end="00:19:12.680">...any business logic you can say filter out for...only english or do</p>
      <p begin="00:19:12.680" end="00:19:18.990">there'slike whatever you want to...you do it will do it on every operation these are the two classes then this is</p>
      <p begin="00:19:18.990" end="00:19:23.190">a topology the topology the one which binds or</p>
      <p begin="00:19:23.190" end="00:19:27.130">stitches together the spouse in the...so?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:27.130" end="00:19:30.800">Inherit right now you can see that there is one spout and there's one</p>
      <p begin="00:19:30.800" end="00:19:36.190">...so to quickly go through it basically this</p>
      <p begin="00:19:36.190" end="00:19:40.550">...takes like the name then it takes context which comes from the get</p>
      <p begin="00:19:40.550" end="00:19:45.360">method then it says what is your schema and the schemas just the tweet</p>
      <p begin="00:19:45.360" end="00:19:49.990">and that's it and then it says the parallelism and I have project one so that</p>
      <p begin="00:19:49.990" end="00:19:54.970">...we are we were be unable to go and jump in and when detailed is</p>
      <p begin="00:19:54.970" end="00:20:00.670">how the scale outings happen basically...whether you talk about storm</p>
      <p begin="00:20:00.670" end="00:20:04.680">hb is how do they have many things in parallel which is about the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:04.680" end="00:20:09.080">scalability which is about the fault tolerance all of this so</p>
      <p begin="00:20:09.080" end="00:20:12.750">...you whether I write discord and analyze five</p>
      <p begin="00:20:12.750" end="00:20:16.090">...or I analyze five million tweaks this code does not</p>
      <p begin="00:20:16.090" end="00:20:22.650">change and all you have to do is maybe you increase the size of the cluster</p>
      <p begin="00:20:22.650" end="00:20:27.440">and on that also I will show you in a second how you do it in the...so</p>
      <p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:31.960">with this much pretty much I can go and compile it and put it on my</p>
      <p begin="00:20:31.960" end="00:20:36.920">...cluster and you will see the tweets but the problem is...see that reach...you</p>
      <p begin="00:20:36.920" end="00:20:43.550">...front-end and eigenvalue that it is analyzing but, you can't see it so,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:43.550" end="00:20:46.920">basically what they will do now is that you will quickly create</p>
      <p begin="00:20:46.920" end="00:20:51.660">...and then we can connect the two sides and then go from there sounds good and</p>
      <p begin="00:20:51.660" end="00:20:56.860">real quick and the second pull down here where the where the twitter bowl that's where I would put business</p>
      <p begin="00:20:56.860" end="00:21:00.440">logics like by and other reference data that I want...maybe I have</p>
      <p begin="00:21:00.440" end="00:21:05.090">...twitter handles and I had information my serum about them I would...I could join it in there and then</p>
      <p begin="00:21:05.090" end="00:21:09.710">...to another downstream system okay all right so I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:21:09.710" end="00:21:13.770">to build the front-end so if I'm going to build this front-end traditionally</p>
      <p begin="00:21:13.770" end="00:21:16.870">as a dot net developer I would want to use some sort of web</p>
      <p begin="00:21:16.870" end="00:21:21.770">...technology to connect my...my front-end so since this is all in csharp my able to use signal</p>
      <p begin="00:21:21.770" end="00:21:24.930">are yep that's a great one basically strong uses the</p>
      <p begin="00:21:24.930" end="00:21:29.820">push mechanism so basically any application or anything</p>
      <p begin="00:21:29.820" end="00:21:35.000">which are very you can push your stream of data is an ideal one like the recent riza our</p>
      <p begin="00:21:35.000" end="00:21:39.300">...also allows that so you can also use our...you where you can...the data directly to</p>
      <p begin="00:21:39.300" end="00:21:44.280">your dashboard all right so I've got visual studio and to make sure there's no magic going on</p>
      <p begin="00:21:44.280" end="00:21:49.750">behind the scenes I'm...to do file new project right from here to do asp dot net app we'll call</p>
      <p begin="00:21:49.750" end="00:21:51.530">it build twenty fifteen?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:52.830" end="00:21:56.720">Avi demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:21:57.430">And, I'm going to do</p>
      <p begin="00:21:57.430" end="00:22:04.030">an empty whether api app and I'm not...in the cloud just yet and click on okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:04.030" end="00:22:07.970">The reason I chose to do what api app is I'm going to just have</p>
      <p begin="00:22:07.970" end="00:22:11.650">an index page that is going to connect a single our community</p>
      <p begin="00:22:11.650" end="00:22:15.940">...smell page and then eventually we might connect to our</p>
      <p begin="00:22:15.940" end="00:22:20.660">age base data stream and I'll do that through api and pull that into my front-end.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:20.660" end="00:22:24.130">So,...this creates.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:24.130" end="00:22:29.220">So, here's my basic build demo so the first thing since we're going to use signal</p>
      <p begin="00:22:29.220" end="00:22:33.910">are is I'm going-to go ahead and in stall the signal our new get package</p>
      <p begin="00:22:33.910" end="00:22:43.810">...install anyone know what it is...for bonus points.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:43.810" end="00:22:47.250">Yes, whoever said that was right now yeah, so, it's a single are is</p>
      <p begin="00:22:47.250" end="00:22:52.360">...that...are you can always do this through the gooey as well I just think that installs</p>
      <p begin="00:22:52.360" end="00:22:57.200">little faster if you do it through the command-line hopefully it will do this.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:57.200" end="00:22:59.490">There we go.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:59.490" end="00:23:03.180">...afraid I'm going to type in a spell...wrong...some than my codes going to fail</p>
      <p begin="00:23:03.180" end="00:23:06.880">...I have someone else's library right so we have then</p>
      <p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:10.680">stalwarts and song you can see its adding all...references for j query</p>
      <p begin="00:23:10.680" end="00:23:14.060">and single are all that I need to use so I haven't had...</p>
      <p begin="00:23:15.080" end="00:23:18.950">Do much yet?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:18.950" end="00:23:23.360">What is done it gives me this nice read me that reminds me that I need to create a</p>
      <p begin="00:23:23.360" end="00:23:25.810">owen startup class?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:25.810" end="00:23:29.470">I'm going to use the our visual studio to write click on my projects.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:30.600" end="00:23:32.510">And, go to add.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:32.510" end="00:23:42.040">Is going to say hey you want to...owen startup class which I do call it startup?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:42.040" end="00:23:45.410">And, right here it's...put app.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:45.410" end="00:23:50.600">Dot...how many people here...use signal...before all right so you guys I'm glad I'm going to go through</p>
      <p begin="00:23:50.600" end="00:24:02.470">this pretty quick...so right so now add-in index file.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:02.470" end="00:24:07.670">All right we'll call this...storm.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:07.670" end="00:24:11.910">I've got some snippets here to cheat so I'm just going to dragon my script references which</p>
      <p begin="00:24:11.910" end="00:24:16.610">I'll go through so I'm you...to use when js to style thisalso going</p>
      <p begin="00:24:16.610" end="00:24:21.300">to have my connection to j query to signal...and this is, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:21.300" end="00:24:25.150">the dynamic how that's created is a script here and then on...in the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:25.150" end="00:24:29.780">...js control library cause I'm going to...js and my app logic</p>
      <p begin="00:24:29.780" end="00:24:35.560">for this particular page will be stored in app js file that we will create all right</p>
      <p begin="00:24:35.560" end="00:24:40.360">we'll come into the body so since I'm using when js I'm going to have all my app logic</p>
      <p begin="00:24:40.360" end="00:24:43.450">...space called app so put that here.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:43.450" end="00:24:47.580">And, I'm going to add in my well, that was already did...</p>
      <p begin="00:24:47.580" end="00:24:52.440">edit toolbar so we have a nice toolbar at the top and it's just going to have a little header called</p>
      <p begin="00:24:52.440" end="00:24:55.530">storm signal are and we can change that to be</p>
      <p begin="00:24:55.530" end="00:25:00.460">...on demo right and then it's got a button that's a toggle button so many click it</p>
      <p begin="00:25:00.460" end="00:25:04.250">...to recede tweets...could start my connection and I'll click it</p>
      <p begin="00:25:04.250" end="00:25:08.800">...it so super simple that's our toolbar we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:25:08.800" end="00:25:13.190">display some the text of the tweets so we're going to have a tweet...template that just as an</p>
      <p begin="00:25:13.190" end="00:25:18.540">h to tag that's going to be bound to the contents of the tweet dot text.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:18.540" end="00:25:20.170">And, the last thing we need is a list</p>
      <p begin="00:25:20.170" end="00:25:24.780">view to hold all those tweets so this is cool about when js obviously I</p>
      <p begin="00:25:24.780" end="00:25:29.320">could've done this and angular I could users to j query doesn't matter what I do this in</p>
      <p begin="00:25:29.320" end="00:25:33.810">...js I just telling my item data source...bind it to a variable called</p>
      <p begin="00:25:33.810" end="00:25:39.390">app dot tweets which will be a list so...that go into my scripts.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:39.390" end="00:25:41.070">That's our front-end.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:41.070" end="00:25:45.950">Let's add-in javascript file called app.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:45.950" end="00:25:50.260">And, here if I wanted I could use bauer and I could pull down a</p>
      <p begin="00:25:50.260" end="00:25:55.700">when js starter but I've got it's just a few lines of code so a guy here got my</p>
      <p begin="00:25:55.700" end="00:25:57.780">solving closed function that's got my</p>
      <p begin="00:25:57.780" end="00:26:00.860">...called app that's what we called it and then a statement a</p>
      <p begin="00:26:00.860" end="00:26:06.850">processes so within the app I've already coded up the definition which is pretty</p>
      <p begin="00:26:06.850" end="00:26:11.580">straightforward it's got a tweets object the whole the list of tweets</p>
      <p begin="00:26:11.580" end="00:26:15.580">...what bound to our list view and then I put in a couple code</p>
      <p begin="00:26:15.580" end="00:26:18.140">...some code to kind of demo it before I connect</p>
      <p begin="00:26:18.140" end="00:26:22.940">it lives I've got an interval id when I click the button I'm going to generate some fake tweets</p>
      <p begin="00:26:22.940" end="00:26:28.060">the just says a new build tweet with the straying it's going to do this every second</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.060" end="00:26:42.320">so let's stop here intestine make sure that our app is running?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:42.320" end="00:27:00.270">Share front-end is doing what we expect.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:00.270" end="00:27:02.170">...maybe you should try ee, yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:05.560" end="00:27:08.310">We'll go with that all right so here's storm demo I</p>
      <p begin="00:27:08.310" end="00:27:11.630">click live and hopefully I've got my new tweet so this</p>
      <p begin="00:27:11.630" end="00:27:16.080">is what our front-end looks like it's not anything fancy but we built in what thirty seconds</p>
      <p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:20.790">so if I stop and...started clears...list and goes again so now let's connect</p>
      <p begin="00:27:20.790" end="00:27:23.500">this to signal r so we already have our</p>
      <p begin="00:27:23.500" end="00:27:28.460">startup class the next thing we need is a hub for signal are so</p>
      <p begin="00:27:28.460" end="00:27:31.970">we'll go here again we knows what new get packages we've</p>
      <p begin="00:27:31.970" end="00:27:34.910">...suggesting we have a single art class so I</p>
      <p begin="00:27:34.910" end="00:27:42.240">will add that we'll call it storm hub because we're going to connect...storm.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:43.600">So, this is where I now have my</p>
      <p begin="00:27:43.600" end="00:27:48.350">storm this is where I will build the function that assad is going to put into the bolt to</p>
      <p begin="00:27:48.350" end="00:27:52.560">send to us so let's call this probably show tweets.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:53.760" end="00:28:01.140">And, let's take a few strings will take the tweet id and the tweets.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:01.140" end="00:28:06.120">And, then ...come in here and we'll say show tweet to our clients.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:06.120" end="00:28:09.620">And, we'll just pass in the same text.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:09.620" end="00:28:15.090">now we've got our...server code that's going to connect with the...that is going to start sending our</p>
      <p begin="00:28:15.090" end="00:28:21.380">front-end clients tweets...the last thing we need to do is wire that up in our javascript.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:21.380" end="00:28:25.940">So, we'll come right here and sort of type...down I have it</p>
      <p begin="00:28:25.940" end="00:28:30.880">right here so what is going to do is going to connect to a storm hub which is...our connection</p>
      <p begin="00:28:30.880" end="00:28:35.550">...then going to should run here's the show tweet function we created which is</p>
      <p begin="00:28:35.550" end="00:28:40.380">ads a tweet to our apps dot tweet list right...the same thing...test</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.380" end="00:28:46.140">code is doing so we'll get rid of our test code inhabit start our connection so we'll get rid of</p>
      <p begin="00:28:46.140" end="00:28:51.230">that now our connection is started and we will stop it and sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:28:51.230" end="00:28:54.980">...interval so now we no longer have some test data being generate every second it's</p>
      <p begin="00:28:54.980" end="00:29:00.050">going-to be coming from our hub and we'll get rid of this down there.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:00.050" end="00:29:05.130">So, just like that we should be able to deploy this to add here and have assad...data so to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:05.130" end="00:29:08.840">should highlight again the visual studio tooling will...click on our project and</p>
      <p begin="00:29:08.840" end="00:29:13.650">...publish and writer visual studio I can come in here click a new</p>
      <p begin="00:29:13.650" end="00:29:16.480">websites...call let's?</p>
      <p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:18.920">Build twenty fifteen avi</p>
      <p begin="00:29:18.920" end="00:29:28.920">demo see if that's available and it is...in the west us.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:28.920" end="00:29:31.210">So, this is going to the edge portal creating</p>
      <p begin="00:29:31.210" end="00:29:35.500">...the website a web server and the west united states and,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:35.500" end="00:29:40.140">it once it creates a will download the publishing profile and we'll have publishable package of</p>
      <p begin="00:29:40.140" end="00:29:45.380">...code and send it out here it is.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:45.380" end="00:29:49.520">So, hopefully as developers maybe you've done this before...not the kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:29:49.520" end="00:29:54.470">shows you how quickly you can use visual studio in the tools that measure provides to get</p>
      <p begin="00:29:54.470" end="00:30:01.560">...just like we have html sites the web team is done a great job as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:01.560" end="00:30:03.080">And, so.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:03.080" end="00:30:07.320">Here we go up online is build twenty fifteen hd demo dot</p>
      <p begin="00:30:07.320" end="00:30:11.810">edu websites net and once we connect assad starts connecting that to</p>
      <p begin="00:30:11.810" end="00:30:16.750">our data we can all come here and we'll see it live...</p>
      <p begin="00:30:16.750" end="00:30:22.460">great so...association of you have the front-end so we will use strong</p>
      <p begin="00:30:22.460" end="00:30:28.530">and from strongly will go and...push these...streams to that and point.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:28.530" end="00:30:31.340">So, the one thing now we need is another</p>
      <p begin="00:30:31.340" end="00:30:36.580">...so remember I hope you have not forgotten so basically there was one spout reading from</p>
      <p begin="00:30:36.580" end="00:30:41.380">...than one bolt that was pretty much not doing anything and then we need another</p>
      <p begin="00:30:41.380" end="00:30:46.450">both that is a...it to the signal are so, again, this is</p>
      <p begin="00:30:46.450" end="00:30:54.330">one of the once we just published online all you...you say op-ed new item.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:54.330" end="00:30:57.070">And, in there if you go and search like my</p>
      <p begin="00:30:57.070" end="00:31:09.940">...already...with this is the signal are both you can go and add this one.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:09.940" end="00:31:12.620">And, now has added this both let me just move it under the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:12.620" end="00:31:18.100">boats directory and if you go and look at it basically</p>
      <p begin="00:31:18.100" end="00:31:21.740">what it does is that it takes the tweets which are coming in and how a</p>
      <p begin="00:31:21.740" end="00:31:26.630">and which are coming is from the board which is which is behind this and then it pushes it</p>
      <p begin="00:31:26.630" end="00:31:30.350">to the website where do I put the website and the hub name all</p>
      <p begin="00:31:30.350" end="00:31:34.740">...of that is captured in the conflict file again it's a good design</p>
      <p begin="00:31:34.740" end="00:31:40.480">...just put everything in there so if you go in there I will go and</p>
      <p begin="00:31:40.480" end="00:31:44.470">add the website here?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:44.470" end="00:31:47.010">Through the snippets.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:47.010" end="00:31:52.530">So, basically it...for the website url and, the signal our hop</p>
      <p begin="00:31:52.530" end="00:31:57.650">again I...hobbies the same you use the...I use the storm...is what I called it yes and</p>
      <p begin="00:31:57.650" end="00:32:03.370">then so the site is...twenty fifteen.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:03.370" end="00:32:06.240">Hd I demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:06.240" end="00:32:09.420">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:09.420" end="00:32:13.900">So, knowledge has the address now there's one thing missing I don't know</p>
      <p begin="00:32:13.900" end="00:32:18.900">if anyone can remember we have not stitch this together as part of the topology</p>
      <p begin="00:32:18.900" end="00:32:23.200">sly added and they're both but it is hanging up in the air so I have to put it as part</p>
      <p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:28.250">of my topology so I will go back to the topology and...</p>
      <p begin="00:32:28.250" end="00:32:33.660">do another set...against the to save time I will just add this thing of</p>
      <p begin="00:32:33.660" end="00:32:36.750">it says the...signal are</p>
      <p begin="00:32:36.750" end="00:32:41.430">and added these for lines so basically it gives...name signal</p>
      <p begin="00:32:41.430" end="00:32:46.800">our bolt and then it gives the get method it gives you the schema</p>
      <p begin="00:32:46.800" end="00:32:51.000">and it says from there that we just coming and that we just coming from the previous</p>
      <p begin="00:32:51.000" end="00:32:55.200">board so this is how it is stooges together the topology the</p>
      <p begin="00:32:55.200" end="00:32:58.010">...just look for the name space.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:58.010" end="00:33:07.030">Which is this one and I will added there?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:07.030" end="00:33:10.180">Hopefully not should come file.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:10.180" end="00:33:14.480">Yep, okay, so, again, just repeat what we did was we added another</p>
      <p begin="00:33:14.480" end="00:33:19.400">...this...takes the data from coming from the from the spout into the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:19.400" end="00:33:23.910">...and this is a signal are both...just needs an address</p>
      <p begin="00:33:23.910" end="00:33:28.600">...just keep pushing everything that it is getting at the streams so.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:28.600" end="00:33:31.910">Now if...go...compile this thing we can go and actually deploy</p>
      <p begin="00:33:31.910" end="00:33:36.080">it to my big data storm cluster...did I get the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:36.080" end="00:33:41.970">strong cluster again, I commuted beforehand because it takes fifteen minutes for the cluster to spin</p>
      <p begin="00:33:41.970" end="00:33:46.900">up like how many people have actually seen the as your portal like either this one or the new one</p>
      <p begin="00:33:48.120" end="00:33:55.270">...a great otherwise I would have one back to the slidesso, basically you can see new and then you can go</p>
      <p begin="00:33:55.270" end="00:33:58.600">...inside and then you can take the type of the cluster you want this is the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:58.600" end="00:34:03.450">...cluster I have two one is the hardest online let-me</p>
      <p begin="00:34:03.450" end="00:34:08.510">...this thing and the other one is database one which I will use for other purposes</p>
      <p begin="00:34:08.510" end="00:34:13.400">so I will go and deploy to this cluster if you go on the scale you can see right now it's a</p>
      <p begin="00:34:13.400" end="00:34:16.200">...cluster but even if a whether it</p>
      <p begin="00:34:16.200" end="00:34:21.700">...even if that apologies deployed or not I can literally</p>
      <p begin="00:34:21.700" end="00:34:27.200">take this and go all the way here and I can go to any number of nodes right now I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:34:27.200" end="00:34:33.040">...eighty-one because that's because of the...but if I if I want I can make it...order five hundred nodes</p>
      <p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:40.100">...once I ...in the demo then I go to email that how much money</p>
      <p begin="00:34:40.100" end="00:34:46.400">...wasted then I don't do that so we'll keep it to for node so,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:46.400" end="00:34:50.890">let's go back here and deploy so the other thing which we have done is that we have</p>
      <p begin="00:34:50.890" end="00:34:54.650">made really easy from the visual studio to go and deploy into any of the</p>
      <p begin="00:34:54.650" end="00:34:59.320">...or...clusters so if you goal here and rightly you will see the option since is</p>
      <p begin="00:34:59.320" end="00:35:03.130">a is a strong topology that submit to the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:03.130" end="00:35:05.130">...insights dom.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:05.130" end="00:35:11.240">It will show me all the clusters that I have in my subscription because I have installed as</p>
      <p begin="00:35:11.240" end="00:35:14.130">...that comes for visual should use</p>
      <p begin="00:35:14.130" end="00:35:18.980">...you get two-point-five now I can go in I can deployed to the to</p>
      <p begin="00:35:18.980" end="00:35:22.930">the staging cluster and isa submit.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:22.930" end="00:35:26.280">At this point it will take that code and hopefully if I have not made</p>
      <p begin="00:35:26.280" end="00:35:29.130">an error it will go and deployed in my</p>
      <p begin="00:35:29.130" end="00:35:34.120">...as soon as it gets deployed it will</p>
      <p begin="00:35:34.120" end="00:35:38.940">it will run and it will start reading the to each that are coming in it will look for the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:38.940" end="00:35:43.170">...hash codes that the defined in over spout because</p>
      <p begin="00:35:43.170" end="00:35:48.150">...the connector save look for all that which coming under this subject heading and then</p>
      <p begin="00:35:48.150" end="00:35:54.200">it will give you it will send it to the next...and...ascended to the third...</p>
      <p begin="00:35:54.200" end="00:36:00.450">is the signal...similarly say what have to do all I have to push it to a site and it will</p>
      <p begin="00:36:00.450" end="00:36:05.770">push there seems like there was another one which...kill actually?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:05.770" end="00:36:09.750">So, this is some old topology I will just skillet in</p>
      <p begin="00:36:09.750" end="00:36:11.550">...while we're waiting for the topology</p>
      <p begin="00:36:11.550" end="00:36:16.240">deploy if you're so inclined you can pull out your phone and write-up a tweet</p>
      <p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:20.910">with the hash tags either has tag build twenty fifteen or build fifteen or build</p>
      <p begin="00:36:20.910" end="00:36:26.280">win but we all them just any of them and once we do that at all show</p>
      <p begin="00:36:26.280" end="00:36:34.620">up live on the screen...is...address...twenty fifteen hci demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:34.620" end="00:36:43.490">Demo dot as...websites dot net.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:43.490" end="00:36:55.730">You can see we're getting tweets that are coming in now.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:55.730" end="00:36:58.720">So,...basically irrespective of</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:03.570">...is this is the part ofstreaming twitter data is where's all planned it</p>
      <p begin="00:37:03.570" end="00:37:10.230">moi all...bad because we wanted to see some smil so,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:10.230" end="00:37:14.990">basically again like irrespective of what are the data is the key thing is that...you need</p>
      <p begin="00:37:14.990" end="00:37:19.890">an api to connect whether you connect to the event of whether you connect to your device</p>
      <p begin="00:37:19.890" end="00:37:24.790">you connect to another source in this case we chose to connect to the twitter so again the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:24.790" end="00:37:29.770">...because...a little more interesting and then it is about how you build app by connecting</p>
      <p begin="00:37:29.770" end="00:37:32.270">...together and then you use</p>
      <p begin="00:37:32.270" end="00:37:38.580">various technologies of whether for storing or for displaying ok so let's do something</p>
      <p begin="00:37:38.580" end="00:37:43.740">as right...make itlike deed...can we go and add to it,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:43.740" end="00:37:48.610">yeah, so, we're receiving data from a stream but that's not very useful we can't do analysis on it we</p>
      <p begin="00:37:48.610" end="00:37:52.770">can't review it later so why don't we start and use h</p>
      <p begin="00:37:52.770" end="00:37:57.270">base and start storing this data age base yep let's do that so I will</p>
      <p begin="00:37:57.270" end="00:38:04.650">go ahead so, again, this part is all we build it out as part of for deploying</p>
      <p begin="00:38:04.650" end="00:38:09.210">...whole strom topology management is within the visual</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09.210" end="00:38:13.800">...I can go and say let me guild...topology?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:13.800" end="00:38:18.940">And, now...the...will stop coming to the website and v will</p>
      <p begin="00:38:18.940" end="00:38:23.920">add the hbo and as...is saying what it gives you is that it gives you a persistent</p>
      <p begin="00:38:23.920" end="00:38:28.770">storage most of the time who are people who are building streaming applications</p>
      <p begin="00:38:28.770" end="00:38:33.760">...they do both batch and stream so they do streaming just like the you signal</p>
      <p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:38.690">...our by or any other life dashboard but at the same time they don't want to lose the data</p>
      <p begin="00:38:38.690" end="00:38:42.510">which is coming in they want to store the data that is used for brand</p>
      <p begin="00:38:42.510" end="00:38:48.100">analysis for historical data for machine learning for deeper analysis of your data and this</p>
      <p begin="00:38:48.100" end="00:38:52.890">dumb is like has become very common which is called the lambda architecture them lend architecture is</p>
      <p begin="00:38:52.890" end="00:38:57.770">very splits the stream for real-time and it also sources in batch so what we will do</p>
      <p begin="00:38:57.770" end="00:39:02.670">that we will go and use nh basic...and put all these trees that are coming in into the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:02.670" end="00:39:06.520">...as well as continue to get it on our live dashboard.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:06.520" end="00:39:09.300">So, what I will do is that of coming back to</p>
      <p begin="00:39:09.300" end="00:39:13.150">over application I will go here and now add another</p>
      <p begin="00:39:13.150" end="00:39:15.610">...and this time it will be the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:15.610" end="00:39:20.870">hbo right board so I add new item and again all of these are and,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:20.870" end="00:39:25.210">not in vs but online so if you click on the online and then search for it you should be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:39:25.210" end="00:39:27.830">see these ones?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.830" end="00:39:37.930">As I will say that ...bolt.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:37.930" end="00:39:41.390">And, let me just move it under here.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.390" end="00:39:46.620">And, again, same standard process we will if you want to go and modify something in</p>
      <p begin="00:39:46.620" end="00:39:53.250">...we can go and modify that this is a very general-purpose</p>
      <p begin="00:39:53.250" end="00:39:57.290">...is...we did a few modification so that the number of lines we</p>
      <p begin="00:39:57.290" end="00:39:59.960">have digest to match the schema</p>
      <p begin="00:39:59.960" end="00:40:04.630">...we can avoid those things but in general this is a very john urbanization</p>
      <p begin="00:40:04.630" end="00:40:07.510">...boarded...you have to just give the address of your</p>
      <p begin="00:40:07.510" end="00:40:11.340">...base and the schema you want to go in the table name and if you go</p>
      <p begin="00:40:11.340" end="00:40:16.260">into it before I do that let me go in actually...connected to my age base...so this is my age</p>
      <p begin="00:40:16.260" end="00:40:20.480">base cluster and again this is the topic I'm not going to...which is like</p>
      <p begin="00:40:20.480" end="00:40:24.670">...a...has a has a shel where you can say show me the tables show me the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:24.670" end="00:40:29.080">...show me everything which is in there so, for example, you can go ahead and you can say</p>
      <p begin="00:40:29.080" end="00:40:33.390">list and...show you all the tables and right now there is no table india so</p>
      <p begin="00:40:33.390" end="00:40:39.750">...starting with an empty age base cluster...look up a come back to advanced once</p>
      <p begin="00:40:39.750" end="00:40:45.870">the once the data xr to come in and...table which is created.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:45.870" end="00:40:46.380">So, again,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:46.380" end="00:40:52.540">this similar process which we did we will go to theto the conflict file and</p>
      <p begin="00:40:52.540" end="00:40:58.390">...the information about our were ...cluster so in</p>
      <p begin="00:40:58.390" end="00:41:02.150">...the add the...the name of the...</p>
      <p begin="00:41:02.150" end="00:41:07.780">cluster username password the column name as well as the schema which I</p>
      <p begin="00:41:07.780" end="00:41:13.210">want to...in define and this is the one which will be picked up by this board so now</p>
      <p begin="00:41:13.210" end="00:41:18.200">if you remember the last thing is that we have to stitched to the topology but otherwise it is just a free-floating</p>
      <p begin="00:41:18.200" end="00:41:22.310">...so I come here I have to the my one and then similarly what I</p>
      <p begin="00:41:22.310" end="00:41:28.280">see is that the name the get method of what is the schemaand,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:28.280" end="00:41:35.770">from where does it get the data.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:35.770" end="00:41:40.570">I added those things so it's the same eigen define the name...the get method I</p>
      <p begin="00:41:40.570" end="00:41:45.920">define the schema in this case the schema is not that much useful because this</p>
      <p begin="00:41:45.920" end="00:41:49.700">board is the lost in the...not sending any there so I could</p>
      <p begin="00:41:49.700" end="00:41:54.460">...this part in it will not make a difference and then from there does it get the data it gets</p>
      <p begin="00:41:54.460" end="00:41:59.290">the data from the from this board which is that reachable so?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:59.290" end="00:42:05.750">So, now with these three changes if I go and again, build my.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:05.750" end="00:42:06.420">My project.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:07.510" end="00:42:12.320">Again,...the redeployment I should be able to see the data</p>
      <p begin="00:42:12.320" end="00:42:18.740">matches coming...now stored as a as part of my age base.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:18.740" end="00:42:28.290">So, now we can again goal here two-minus cluster.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:28.290" end="00:42:33.700">The storm cluster.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:33.700" end="00:42:35.670">And, right now you can see there's no topology because,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:35.670" end="00:42:41.280">because the last one so as soon as this comes up you will start again seeing</p>
      <p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:45.960">...the tweets flowing through it and the number the number of to is that are</p>
      <p begin="00:42:45.960" end="00:42:49.420">process act again like some of the details region go in but</p>
      <p begin="00:42:49.420" end="00:42:56.260">there's lot of somebody that comes displayed as part of the topology when you go and run it.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:56.260" end="00:42:58.090">Now if I go and open the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:58.090" end="00:43:02.620">...and had the back-end or you just see if it search straining,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:02.620" end="00:43:07.890">yeah, so, it will go to just us artistry...here again.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:07.890" end="00:43:08.650">And, as some</p>
      <p begin="00:43:08.650" end="00:43:14.140">...comes in I can go and...that is also going into the age base.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:14.140" end="00:43:17.060">Let me go and see.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:17.060" end="00:43:33.020">So, you can see there is still zero in here.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:33.020" end="00:43:37.520">I don't know what website are.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:37.520" end="00:43:49.530">It's our build twenty fifteen hd demo.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:49.530" end="00:43:54.420">Ok, so, now basically again this was the party had already seen but now if you go into the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:54.420" end="00:43:59.530">age base and now if you say list you should see the table which is the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:59.530" end="00:44:04.740">trick-or-treat underscore dvr table and all that was that are coming on the screen are also being</p>
      <p begin="00:44:04.740" end="00:44:10.860">saved here so if you say let's say right now we don't have that many so</p>
      <p begin="00:44:10.860" end="00:44:18.910">...can even do a scan which will go in print all of them.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:18.910" end="00:44:22.370">So, this is go...printing all...are in there so now all</p>
      <p begin="00:44:22.370" end="00:44:25.990">the tweets are coming on the signal are and they're also going into the</p>
      <p begin="00:44:25.990" end="00:44:29.110">...base and getting persisted and now this is a</p>
      <p begin="00:44:29.110" end="00:44:32.450">very powerful store you can go and do anything with it you can go and build</p>
      <p begin="00:44:32.450" end="00:44:36.930">...a lot of different type of applications so</p>
      <p begin="00:44:36.930" end="00:44:42.010">this one like do you want to go and build something on top of it like what's,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:42.010" end="00:44:46.770">what's your plan...so what we'll do now is we'll build and I'll show you how you would take</p>
      <p begin="00:44:46.770" end="00:44:51.590">and connect that to api comptroller so you can start pulling in the data through a restful api</p>
      <p begin="00:44:51.590" end="00:44:52.930">...ahead and switch over?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:54.250" end="00:44:58.400">All right so we're seeing my screen so it's utc time right now is two thirteen am</p>
      <p begin="00:44:58.400" end="00:45:03.230">I want remember that because that's when we started this job so when we view our</p>
      <p begin="00:45:03.230" end="00:45:07.780">api control review the tweets...pulled back the first...be around to twelve in the</p>
      <p begin="00:45:07.780" end="00:45:13.980">mornings restoring them on the server and utc time so let's go ahead and go individual studio.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:13.980" end="00:45:16.610">And, the first thing like with single are will want to do is</p>
      <p begin="00:45:16.610" end="00:45:20.520">install there's a new get package to the csharp library to connect</p>
      <p begin="00:45:20.520" end="00:45:23.500">h base so we'll install that and that's install.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:24.540" end="00:45:29.270">Package microsoft dot age base dot client.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:29.270" end="00:45:35.330">So, this is the csharp the csharp client that connects to the age based apis</p>
      <p begin="00:45:35.330" end="00:45:40.000">so you can insert data and you can pull down data and this is the same</p>
      <p begin="00:45:40.000" end="00:45:44.990">...library that we had in a...code invisible</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.990" end="00:45:50.490">so now that we've got that installed we can keep going on so we've installed the</p>
      <p begin="00:45:50.490" end="00:45:54.550">new get package the next thing we should probably do is create a web</p>
      <p begin="00:45:54.550" end="00:45:59.420">...and api comptroller for receiving this service will come in</p>
      <p begin="00:45:59.420" end="00:46:05.130">will create a new scaffolding item for a web empty what api controller.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:05.130" end="00:46:11.200">And, we'll call it tweets api.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:11.200" end="00:46:17.460">So, as a saddam hussein is the data is stored...h base but age</p>
      <p begin="00:46:17.460" end="00:46:22.450">bases schema less so he define the schema as he was writing it and if we if we would have seen</p>
      <p begin="00:46:22.450" end="00:46:27.080">...he was doing as you...youencoding all of the data into a</p>
      <p begin="00:46:27.080" end="00:46:30.050">...array and storing that so what we'll have to do is define</p>
      <p begin="00:46:30.050" end="00:46:32.860">our model and then do the same thing take it from a biter</p>
      <p begin="00:46:32.860" end="00:46:37.790">...into our model so I'm going-to go ahead and add-in a model that is the same</p>
      <p begin="00:46:37.790" end="00:46:42.860">as the model that assad used so this is where it within the same solution you</p>
      <p begin="00:46:42.860" end="00:46:49.860">could reference the other ones but otherwise you would have the to duplicate this code so we'll call it tweet?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:49.860" end="00:46:54.440">And, the model I have is right here so there's a model it's got the id the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:54.440" end="00:46:58.800">string the idea of the tweet represented a...got created at the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:58.800" end="00:47:02.410">...of the tweet and other characters or other data that assad</p>
      <p begin="00:47:02.410" end="00:47:07.950">is saving for that the other thing that we should add...we're here is an ad</p>
      <p begin="00:47:07.950" end="00:47:09.100">...existing item</p>
      <p begin="00:47:09.100" end="00:47:14.250">...item is all on get hub and we'll provide the link here at the end of the demo but,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:14.250" end="00:47:21.070">what it's the age base reader class so there's this class is what connects to rh</p>
      <p begin="00:47:21.070" end="00:47:26.710">base cluster and then does the does the scan on the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:26.710" end="00:47:31.800">apis and retrieves back the data so that's where I was saying it's going to do a scan and it's going to</p>
      <p begin="00:47:31.800" end="00:47:36.760">...back all the information and we're going to take it from a wide array and put it into a straying or</p>
      <p begin="00:47:36.760" end="00:47:39.140">...integer a daytime whatever we're storing it</p>
      <p begin="00:47:39.140" end="00:47:45.310">from so this is what also enables the api...go really fast so it saying</p>
      <p begin="00:47:45.310" end="00:47:50.000">that we are missing the name space for the tweet that we created so let's go ahead and add-in</p>
      <p begin="00:47:50.000" end="00:47:56.680">are using statement for that and this is good so now we can wire up</p>
      <p begin="00:47:56.680" end="00:47:59.760">Our web comptroller api again this code will share</p>
      <p begin="00:47:59.760" end="00:48:05.690">is all on is all on get hub so we'll pose that link?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:05.690" end="00:48:09.490">At the end here so I'm just going to add in our name space again for our...so that we've got the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:09.490" end="00:48:19.610">age base reader I don't know why tweet...pull...do the same.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:19.610" end="00:48:24.290">...and it's we need to add-in a...</p>
      <p begin="00:48:24.290" end="00:48:28.410">All right so now we've got our wedding api that's connecting to h...it's doing</p>
      <p begin="00:48:28.410" end="00:48:33.550">a scan and it's going to return the data as a json object and, restful</p>
      <p begin="00:48:33.550" end="00:48:38.630">service so the last thing...to do is add-in rh base.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:38.630" end="00:48:40.080">Connection information so that</p>
      <p begin="00:48:40.080" end="00:48:44.760">I can connect so I have that saved again it's the same is assad had</p>
      <p begin="00:48:44.760" end="00:48:50.040">...connecting to his cluster with his name password in the table that we want to retrieved from</p>
      <p begin="00:48:50.040" end="00:48:56.730">some save this and now if I run as locally.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:56.730" end="00:49:00.760">I can run this locally because the data is connecting to the to the clouds I can</p>
      <p begin="00:49:00.760" end="00:49:05.150">deploy this and I would work and if I try and run this locally hit live it's not going to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:05.150" end="00:49:09.620">work as the tweets aren't coming here but I can show you the api comptroller and,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:09.620" end="00:49:20.430">I can deploy it to the clouds all-clear this might be a little faster so we'll see.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:20.430" end="00:49:25.120">Well, that's...and paste in the url so it's connecting this is, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:25.120" end="00:49:30.710">what api routing so it's going to my api called tweets api it's got</p>
      <p begin="00:49:30.710" end="00:49:35.720">the topic and then a time...the time that you want to get tweets from so that we can scan</p>
      <p begin="00:49:35.720" end="00:49:39.750">are table maybe we want to jump to our we want to go back in time and</p>
      <p begin="00:49:39.750" end="00:49:44.430">how many do we want and the one thing that I saw side do is our topic isn't</p>
      <p begin="00:49:44.430" end="00:49:48.670">...general...do that so by hit this?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:48.670" end="00:49:52.510">We should see tweets starting around the to twelve am</p>
      <p begin="00:49:52.510" end="00:49:57.010">...and here we go so the first one was put in</p>
      <p begin="00:49:57.010" end="00:50:00.490">...twelve and twenty seven seconds so</p>
      <p begin="00:50:00.490" end="00:50:03.290">now this is api is going through and</p>
      <p begin="00:50:03.290" end="00:50:08.920">its pulling down the data that assad is storing...base so if I was to come in here and,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:08.920" end="00:50:12.650">...only want ten this will then come down and filter my list</p>
      <p begin="00:50:12.650" end="00:50:14.730">...ten I can change my date and</p>
      <p begin="00:50:14.730" end="00:50:19.260">time if I want to jump into something more recent I can come in here and put</p>
      <p begin="00:50:19.260" end="00:50:23.410">in my time and I want to go to the...is it now so maybe</p>
      <p begin="00:50:23.410" end="00:50:36.620">two eighteen and, hit this so now we'll jump.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:36.620" end="00:50:41.130">All right I don't know the time syntax to get it to go to the actual time but when you</p>
      <p begin="00:50:41.130" end="00:50:44.830">connect adding url encoded it-would pull down in jumped into the next</p>
      <p begin="00:50:44.830" end="00:50:50.490">the next set so this is kind of a very generic example of we're taking</p>
      <p begin="00:50:50.490" end="00:50:54.520">tweet were archiving them or saving them but some of the business use case you can see</p>
      <p begin="00:50:54.520" end="00:50:58.060">ismaybe you are the build keynote,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:58.060" end="00:51:03.010">for example, we've got build going on and you want to archive all of the keynote all the tweets that are coming in</p>
      <p begin="00:51:03.010" end="00:51:08.300">...the keynote so that you can run analysis and run sentiment and understand what was the most</p>
      <p begin="00:51:08.300" end="00:51:13.120">tweet what time period where the most treated was it when we announced the visual studio code was it</p>
      <p begin="00:51:13.120" end="00:51:17.310">when it...showed how low...right so you could go and you could archive and</p>
      <p begin="00:51:17.310" end="00:51:22.010">start doing analysis and say okay which features was everyone more excited about and one thing that</p>
      <p begin="00:51:22.010" end="00:51:26.160">I thought of as we're doing this demo is I often don't</p>
      <p begin="00:51:26.160" end="00:51:29.380">watch live tv so I didn't get a chance to watch the keno</p>
      <p begin="00:51:29.380" end="00:51:34.570">...actually flying and I'm a...so I sometimes like to watch the</p>
      <p begin="00:51:34.570" end="00:51:37.040">...tweets but I can't do that if I</p>
      <p begin="00:51:37.040" end="00:51:42.200">fdr so what we created we kind of package this up a little bit more and we created</p>
      <p begin="00:51:42.200" end="00:51:47.310">data dvr dot com so if you this is the code that will share on get...is</p>
      <p begin="00:51:47.310" end="00:51:49.090">...project so if you go to data</p>
      <p begin="00:51:49.090" end="00:51:53.950">...dot com I we just did a few topics I like the any I'm a huge</p>
      <p begin="00:51:53.950" end="00:51:56.420">...gel fan so I got my play-off we're going on for the black</p>
      <p begin="00:51:56.420" end="00:52:00.650">...as we got nhl topics being monitored we've got build and we've got</p>
      <p begin="00:52:00.650" end="00:52:05.400">gamma drones so if we click on build we can see this is during the keno right around the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:05.400" end="00:52:09.250">time we announced the...robot came out so we can</p>
      <p begin="00:52:09.250" end="00:52:13.450">help play and this is going to start showing all those tweets that were happening at</p>
      <p begin="00:52:13.450" end="00:52:18.270">one-thirty right so we kinda took this and made a consumer use case of</p>
      <p begin="00:52:18.270" end="00:52:22.890">it but the real business use case of archiving these tweets might be that</p>
      <p begin="00:52:22.890" end="00:52:27.770">we are doing sentence sentiment analysis were seeing what most people are excited about so, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:27.770" end="00:52:32.810">big data can have multiple facets of areas when you want to know and answer different problems</p>
      <p begin="00:52:32.810" end="00:52:37.690">...exactly like basically...tim said like basically this is initially like you can go to either that</p>
      <p begin="00:52:37.690" end="00:52:42.030">...like...keynote and then you open this on the side and then</p>
      <p begin="00:52:42.030" end="00:52:47.190">...the as if it happened at that time and...to reading about it and,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:47.190" end="00:52:51.670">it is exactly using the same topology like this is...policy that we finished</p>
      <p begin="00:52:51.670" end="00:52:56.480">building is using the stream version and it is using the cash version and</p>
      <p begin="00:52:56.480" end="00:53:01.470">...app is sitting where it allows both you if you take the time then it will go...base and</p>
      <p begin="00:53:01.470" end="00:53:06.110">pick-up from the cache version if you will see...live at this point so literally now</p>
      <p begin="00:53:06.110" end="00:53:09.060">if likes anyone of you treat it will go</p>
      <p begin="00:53:09.060" end="00:53:13.850">ahead and show it right away so this is that we that is coming in like if someone from the</p>
      <p begin="00:53:13.850" end="00:53:18.520">room to each type raise your hand and, you can...one of these hash tags</p>
      <p begin="00:53:18.520" end="00:53:23.300">...when we made thison sunday we forgot that build twenty fifty</p>
      <p begin="00:53:23.300" end="00:53:27.610">...probably the more popular tweet so it's only as build microsoft build</p>
      <p begin="00:53:27.610" end="00:53:35.710">when so it would have to be one of those tweet if you want appear on-screen but, yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:35.710" end="00:53:38.310">Anyone tweets and appears on screen raise your hand</p>
      <p begin="00:53:38.310" end="00:53:43.160">...funder...out but anyways that's great so basically the one</p>
      <p begin="00:53:43.160" end="00:53:48.370">...which I want to ensure and then we can have two and a ...you have all these like</p>
      <p begin="00:53:48.370" end="00:53:51.060">...seven minutes is the</p>
      <p begin="00:53:51.060" end="00:53:59.640">...so basically let me switch the machine?</p>
      <p begin="00:53:59.640" end="00:54:05.720">Now we got some from greece streaming online how nice, yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:05.720" end="00:54:08.250">Okay, so.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:08.250" end="00:54:12.350">So, basically the...the...pieces the...pieces recovered is</p>
      <p begin="00:54:12.350" end="00:54:18.030">...and...the third one which I will talk about is the high...again like majority...people who are</p>
      <p begin="00:54:18.030" end="00:54:22.990">right now using I do they are using...deposit is a very powerful query language either</p>
      <p begin="00:54:22.990" end="00:54:28.040">...use big or some other query language to cleanse their data modify join data and</p>
      <p begin="00:54:28.040" end="00:54:32.010">then they have the high squeeze go against it and, do all</p>
      <p begin="00:54:32.010" end="00:54:39.340">sort of interesting stuff on top of it so ...me connect to the same cluster which is the</p>
      <p begin="00:54:39.340" end="00:54:43.440">...staging cluster and I will say I will write</p>
      <p begin="00:54:43.440" end="00:54:47.200">...query so, these are the odds of one</p>
      <p begin="00:54:47.200" end="00:54:51.730">...which I've taken in this case is that high of works when you have the data in the</p>
      <p begin="00:54:51.730" end="00:54:55.940">...fs energy-efficient the file system and in case of casual</p>
      <p begin="00:54:55.940" end="00:55:00.850">or that means as long as your data is in the blob store you can you have for that</p>
      <p begin="00:55:00.850" end="00:55:05.800">...api on top of its you can write height so literally anyone out there</p>
      <p begin="00:55:05.800" end="00:55:09.560">who's data is in agile blob can go and ria star writing</p>
      <p begin="00:55:09.560" end="00:55:13.890">highs queries by spinning up and a-z site cluster in this case</p>
      <p begin="00:55:13.890" end="00:55:18.110">...I build the topology I could have sure I could have chosen to take all that</p>
      <p begin="00:55:18.110" end="00:55:20.890">...are coming in and rather than storing...hbo</p>
      <p begin="00:55:20.890" end="00:55:25.670">story directly into the blob store but since I did not do it I just want to show it the</p>
      <p begin="00:55:25.670" end="00:55:31.010">hives what...do is that you can still create a...of table on top of on top of</p>
      <p begin="00:55:31.010" end="00:55:35.400">...base and this is through the survey which is the extensibility nh base with</p>
      <p begin="00:55:35.400" end="00:55:38.420">...lets you use the civilization dc analyzer and</p>
      <p begin="00:55:38.420" end="00:55:43.370">...lies that does that so basically if you if you if you're not doing on</p>
      <p begin="00:55:43.370" end="00:55:47.410">age base but you're just directly doing it on the blob then all you do is use a</p>
      <p begin="00:55:47.410" end="00:55:52.970">create table and then give the schema right now I have to say directional table so now</p>
      <p begin="00:55:52.970" end="00:55:57.610">I'll give you an example of the hives and what people can do is like you can do really,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:57.610" end="00:56:01.930">really deep operations and then is...us analysis</p>
      <p begin="00:56:01.930" end="00:56:06.850">or the machine learning part of the to give you a quick example what I'll do is like I will take all that</p>
      <p begin="00:56:06.850" end="00:56:11.240">...use that are in this cluster and this cluster I don't have many like basically if I</p>
      <p begin="00:56:11.240" end="00:56:19.930">do the count right now because this is the one which we just set up?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:19.930" end="00:56:24.630">Basically the I'll just have...we just started this one but I will go and look at these</p>
      <p begin="00:56:24.630" end="00:56:27.670">one thirty-five queries and I will say...and, gramm and</p>
      <p begin="00:56:27.670" end="00:56:32.080">...is like people go and see which to words or...of the</p>
      <p begin="00:56:32.080" end="00:56:36.420">most commonly together and then you can say show me the top ten</p>
      <p begin="00:56:36.420" end="00:56:43.780">grams of something so basically there is a function...can say...the...grams.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:43.780" end="00:56:47.920">And, what it takes is the is the token and,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:47.920" end="00:56:52.830">in this case I don't have the tokens all I have is the is this is</p>
      <p begin="00:56:52.830" end="00:56:56.290">the strings are the or that...that are coming in so I have</p>
      <p begin="00:56:56.290" end="00:57:00.790">the text instead as what I will do is that I will say?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:00.790" end="00:57:03.610">Make it lower.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:03.610" end="00:57:12.250">And, then I will to organize it and there is a function for that as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:12.250" end="00:57:17.380">So, now it is to organised and then I can say am I looking</p>
      <p begin="00:57:17.380" end="00:57:22.840">at diagrams...or...or force so I'm looking at ...let's</p>
      <p begin="00:57:22.840" end="00:57:26.810">see the bigram and I want to look at the top them.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:26.810" end="00:57:32.110">And, then I can...as and...from and the from is the table name which</p>
      <p begin="00:57:32.110" end="00:57:36.080">in this case is the is that we table and then I just</p>
      <p begin="00:57:36.080" end="00:57:40.910">a select annals of...writing my query select and</p>
      <p begin="00:57:40.910" end="00:57:45.710">grams and now what will happen is just it'll just print the one</p>
      <p begin="00:57:45.710" end="00:57:50.490">big line of like the...that comes out so I want to just printed out on each</p>
      <p begin="00:57:50.490" end="00:57:53.710">separate line so I can use another function which says the</p>
      <p begin="00:57:53.710" end="00:57:59.350">explode which makes it on a separate line.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:59.350" end="00:58:04.570">And, hopefully if I type everything correctly now what I'm doing is I'm taking</p>
      <p begin="00:58:04.570" end="00:58:05.950">...text from the</p>
      <p begin="00:58:05.950" end="00:58:09.850">...making it lower-case then I'm make to...it then I'm doing the</p>
      <p begin="00:58:09.850" end="00:58:14.260">n gramm's looking for the bigram then I'm exploding it so that every shows up in</p>
      <p begin="00:58:14.260" end="00:58:19.260">a separate line now from visual studio I can since I'm connected to measure</p>
      <p begin="00:58:19.260" end="00:58:24.710">cong I can say submit and it will go and submit this query</p>
      <p begin="00:58:24.710" end="00:58:29.060">and again, highly is still so basically if you are used to sequel yup,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:29.060" end="00:58:33.820">yeah, like you have to wait a minute but, again,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:33.820" end="00:58:38.970">it's nobody's powerful...this thing on those one hundred thirty five degrees or</p>
      <p begin="00:58:38.970" end="00:58:42.860">...righted on a billion art which doesn't matter like...just go</p>
      <p begin="00:58:42.860" end="00:58:52.300">and perform and get me the results so here you can see the job status.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:52.300" end="00:58:58.690">So, once it finishes we can go and look, at the results and it'll show you as I said like the</p>
      <p begin="00:58:58.690" end="00:59:03.630">top ten and gramm's on a separate lines so basically hopefully this</p>
      <p begin="00:59:03.630" end="00:59:09.360">guy as I said like the...a lot of topics...are covering here big data how you build</p>
      <p begin="00:59:09.360" end="00:59:14.160">application...stop-off it what other type of things you can go into how you build your stormed apologies</p>
      <p begin="00:59:14.160" end="00:59:18.990">use h base and then like a ten-minute ten seconds into the high but,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:18.990" end="00:59:23.060">that's pretty much what we wanted to cover update take you to a journey</p>
      <p begin="00:59:23.060" end="00:59:26.350">off like taking one data source and build some interesting app out</p>
      <p begin="00:59:26.350" end="00:59:32.610">of it as tim said like most of the stuff we showed you is already out there you can go</p>
      <p begin="00:59:32.610" end="00:59:36.510">to data dvr dot com right now you can play with it like this if</p>
      <p begin="00:59:36.510" end="00:59:41.140">...did it and deployed on sunday evening around seven so at least during</p>
      <p begin="00:59:41.140" end="00:59:45.440">that last for days you can go to any time and pick the topic and it will show you the</p>
      <p begin="00:59:45.440" end="00:59:50.170">tweets as if they are happening right now...is there the</p>
      <p begin="00:59:50.170" end="00:59:55.110">...sense...I use their all online soI hope this was useful for</p>
      <p begin="00:59:55.110" end="01:00:00.320">you if you have questions we...just two more minutes lunch but this wide up...with the thank you?</p>
