      <p begin="00:00:00.330" end="00:00:03.010">Welcome to build a hi there I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:00:03.010" end="00:00:07.370">...there I am the software...a</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.370" end="00:00:12.160">...software engineering manager here at microsoft working on the visual</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.160" end="00:00:16.410">studio id team getting this talk on writing visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.410" end="00:00:21.990">extensions I'm going to sort of give you an overview of how to get started some tips</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.990" end="00:00:26.250">antics along the way and by the end of the talk I hope that you'll have enough under your</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.250" end="00:00:32.670">belt to go back and start building extensions for visual studio ...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.670" end="00:00:38.100">The agenda for this talk is I'm going to start with a vary basic</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.100" end="00:00:43.380">a extension and, walk you through the process of understanding what goes</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.380" end="00:00:48.570">into extension then we'll go about publishing extension and as we goal</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.570" end="00:00:54.810">down the road...different aspects of visions...extensibility fundamentals like math</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.810" end="00:00:58.490">...packages and whatnot and</p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.490" end="00:01:03.030">the towards the end we'll put it all together to sort of get a sense of what we have accomplished and what</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.030" end="00:01:10.510">more you could actually accomplish in terms of building extensions...studio?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.510" end="00:01:14.360">...to the asset is very powerful and extensible there's tons of functionality</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.360" end="00:01:18.070">...visual studio comes with so,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.070" end="00:01:23.500">much...that sometimes I wonder where that...too much in there and,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.500" end="00:01:28.250">what would you do but then I just step back and say what would you do if you...some of the functionality</p>
      <p begin="00:01:28.250" end="00:01:34.290">does not even exist that, for example, if I had a swiss army knife and, I needed to use</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.290" end="00:01:38.880">...to start the flame or hammer to break all something like that right may not missing some</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:45.460">function because obviously cannot use ...me knife to break a while so,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.460" end="00:01:48.490">that's the sort of...make within...when we build a feature</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.490" end="00:01:54.530">...functionality we look at it and say is this something thatextension author can...if an</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.530" end="00:01:59.390">...author can extended then probably will think a little bit more before we add that functionality</p>
      <p begin="00:01:59.390" end="00:02:03.910">...years but at times we are also realize that some function to cannot be added by</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.910" end="00:02:07.890">an extension author at all right then we go about adding the function</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.890" end="00:02:13.580">...so there's a reason why there's tons of functionality in...there's a method to the magnus right</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.610" end="00:02:19.800">...visual studio given that it has so much functionality in there it's completely configure...like a</p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.800" end="00:02:25.560">lot of things that can...for example, in this case I'm using the?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.560" end="00:02:29.190">Light team if I wanted to change the team for visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:02:29.190" end="00:02:31.600">...go about and say.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.600" end="00:02:36.110">Such for team in the quick lunch ...there and then that puts</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.110" end="00:02:41.550">...tools options window and then right now I'm using blue I could go change it to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.550" end="00:02:45.060">...team and well-off.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:45.060" end="00:02:50.550">I'm using that came now for the purpose of this demo I'm going to continue usinglight</p>
      <p begin="00:02:50.550" end="00:02:57.680">team because it's sort of sits well with the rest of the slide deck I'm going to use the blue thing that.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:02.510">So, visual...like this is just an example of how configured able visual studio...but,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:02.510" end="00:03:06.940">then there is a reason why it's still extensible well,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:06.940" end="00:03:12.710">there's lots of...configured able that might still be places waiting ...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.710" end="00:03:18.820">you might realize that whatever comes in the...standard configuration option might not be good enough for you and,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:18.820" end="00:03:22.800">you could change a...studio behavior for that are using cord</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:29.330">...xml file...of the back let's jump into our</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29.330" end="00:03:32.890">first demo it's if it's going to be very simple bsix project.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.950" end="00:03:39.910">For that what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.910" end="00:03:43.040">...project pulls in.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:48.730">The new project dialogue box and,...there I have I'm on the extensibility not I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:03:48.730" end="00:03:52.700">...mean this extensibility not x exists right now because ahead</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52.700" end="00:03:57.490">...for the demo purposes and I select the basics project now I'm talking</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.490" end="00:04:02.660">vsix but ortiz we six basics is a file that gets generated from a</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02.660" end="00:04:06.330">...project that's what we're doing right now the vsix file</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.330" end="00:04:12.250">...unit of deployment for visual studio extension visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.250" end="00:04:15.340">...extension and, install the contents of the file to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:15.340" end="00:04:19.960">the right location vsix file is...zip file and,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21.170" end="00:04:26.050">that uses open packaging...and...can rename that art basics extension</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.050" end="00:04:30.910">to dot zip and you can see the contents of the zip file basically I'm using any zip</p>
      <p begin="00:04:30.910" end="00:04:35.160">...like windows file explorer even if you ask me what we six</p>
      <p begin="00:04:35.160" end="00:04:42.620">...well I would say it's real studio installer for extensions.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:42.620" end="00:04:48.770">So, now going back to...project that just got...you see that it doesn't have any</p>
      <p begin="00:04:48.770" end="00:04:52.490">...at all and it just has a bsix manifest and the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:52.490" end="00:04:56.860">...right now in the manifest design...there are a few feeds in</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.860" end="00:05:00.410">here that I'd like to take some time to walk you through.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:02.040" end="00:05:07.520">The first one is the product name this is what shows up...someone installs this</p>
      <p begin="00:05:07.520" end="00:05:11.350">extension rate when you go into extensions...sell-out box names that you</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.350" end="00:05:16.200">...here these are the extensions that are installed for me the names in here</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.200" end="00:05:21.450">...pick from the product name that are specified by that specific extension author</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.450" end="00:05:25.890">from the author name by default gets put in from the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:25.890" end="00:05:30.890">...information that they used design individual studio the product</p>
      <p begin="00:05:30.890" end="00:05:35.330">...by default combination of product name and author name and denigrate you can also</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.330" end="00:05:40.290">...will also have to specify...venue update your of extension and uploaded together</p>
      <p begin="00:05:40.290" end="00:05:45.190">you'll keep changing the version number so that your customers who are using your vsix get updated</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.190" end="00:05:50.820">russians there are there is a description and what not you can also provide</p>
      <p begin="00:05:50.820" end="00:05:55.430">license has well it's in the form of...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:55.430" end="00:06:00.010">So, forext I'm going to.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.010" end="00:06:04.030">Provide.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.030" end="00:06:07.800">License file.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.800" end="00:06:13.020">And, then now let's look at install targets and what that means so,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.020" end="00:06:16.370">...targets here what it's saying is this</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.370" end="00:06:19.700">basics installs on fourteen dot</p>
      <p begin="00:06:19.700" end="00:06:25.020">...all russian of visual studio targets...of...which is basically visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:06:25.020" end="00:06:30.600">...and, then it also says that...targets pro?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:30.600" end="00:06:35.550">...us look at all the other plausible options of the product identifier a bunch of options in here</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.550" end="00:06:39.360">...what do each of these mean before we understand what each of these</p>
      <p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:45.870">mean we'll have to take a small...art to understand the visual studious q model basically</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.870" end="00:06:50.820">...model he's...channel model integrated shell is the smallest</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.820" end="00:06:56.890">...in there it's the and, what ships with visual student</p>
      <p begin="00:06:56.890" end="00:07:00.580">...is the integrated development environment</p>
      <p begin="00:07:00.580" end="00:07:05.390">...and source control integration it does not have any programming language</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.390" end="00:07:08.390">included with it and,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:08.390" end="00:07:12.170">this is usually used by extend as...to sort of at their</p>
      <p begin="00:07:12.170" end="00:07:18.600">own programming language and have their own custom visual studio an environment so,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.600" end="00:07:22.970">if you...to build and extension that targets integrated...then</p>
      <p begin="00:07:22.970" end="00:07:27.360">...extension would be install not only on the...visuals</p>
      <p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:32.510">...skills by a by all the other extend those who might have build their own</p>
      <p begin="00:07:32.510" end="00:07:36.210">...using integrated...rate and on top of visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:07:36.210" end="00:07:40.590">...integrated shel you have express...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:40.590" end="00:07:45.400">the community skew express q does not have third-party extensibility support</p>
      <p begin="00:07:45.400" end="00:07:49.260">community skew is a free...visual studio that</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.260" end="00:07:54.250">does have support for extensibility the excuse effort specific targeted scenarios like web</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.250" end="00:08:00.120">development windows desktop application development the pros and enterprise</p>
      <p begin="00:08:00.120" end="00:08:05.650">...at page skills that are on top of community skew?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:05.650" end="00:08:10.760">So, now if you were to have you extension target community what that means is...extension would instagram</p>
      <p begin="00:08:10.760" end="00:08:15.030">...professional enterprise skews if you said</p>
      <p begin="00:08:15.030" end="00:08:19.910">...just targets pro then it will install...pro enterprise basically it won't</p>
      <p begin="00:08:19.910" end="00:08:23.080">install and community so,...overview...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:23.080" end="00:08:27.920">letters jump onto dependencies you can specify dependencies for extension as well by</p>
      <p begin="00:08:27.920" end="00:08:34.100">default what your vsix manifest is seeing here is a requires</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.100" end="00:08:40.230">...forgot...or higher you can add neuron?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:40.230" end="00:08:44.720">Dependency as well and you could say I want to specify dependency from something that's already</p>
      <p begin="00:08:44.720" end="00:08:49.690">installed on this machine and you could probably pick something like well.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.690" end="00:08:53.450">How about?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:54.600" end="00:08:58.390">...and, what you're seeing here is well as long as accord analysis</p>
      <p begin="00:08:58.390" end="00:09:03.270">extension questions from fourteen dot org fifteen dot all basically fifteen</p>
      <p begin="00:09:03.270" end="00:09:06.950">...fifteen...installed...this extension would not install anything which is what</p>
      <p begin="00:09:06.950" end="00:09:10.580">...or higher basically measure version of...article and then this</p>
      <p begin="00:09:10.580" end="00:09:18.450">...this extension...should be...that specify that?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:18.450" end="00:09:21.570">And, now.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.570" end="00:09:26.950">The other piece that I wanted to sort of touch upon is with the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:26.950" end="00:09:31.990">install targets going back and start targets...something that I wanted upon that I did not</p>
      <p begin="00:09:31.990" end="00:09:37.820">color these to check boxes...by default a vsix in...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.820" end="00:09:43.070">for just the user...initiating...this...if however</p>
      <p begin="00:09:43.070" end="00:09:48.030">you want to the vsix to be installed by all the users that use the machine then you</p>
      <p begin="00:09:48.030" end="00:09:52.480">would check this box rate this is mostly used by extensions that</p>
      <p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:55.840">install a lot of productivity features have machine</p>
      <p begin="00:09:55.840" end="00:10:01.240">wide licensing associated with them and use this typically have paid some</p>
      <p begin="00:10:01.240" end="00:10:06.090">sizable amount of money to buy those features and expect this features to be...begins to</p>
      <p begin="00:10:06.090" end="00:10:10.760">...and be available to all the users that use the machine basically and,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:10.760" end="00:10:16.130">there is this another ...here which essentiallyis used</p>
      <p begin="00:10:16.130" end="00:10:21.640">in a different sort of a scenario basically ...basics basically packages</p>

      <p begin="00:10:39.630" end="00:10:44.690">set faces the functionality that's provided in the vsix package?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:44.690" end="00:10:50.470">when your...in certain situations you might want to actually like if</p>

      <p begin="00:11:45.120" end="00:11:46.600">And, build the solution.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:47.750" end="00:11:55.600">And, you'll see that...end...generating...basics package.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:12:00.370">And, then what we'll do is?</p>

      <p begin="00:12:09.910" end="00:12:18.430">So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:18.430" end="00:12:26.560">Go to the location I'm going to rename.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:29.470">And, then we can go look at.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:29.470" end="00:12:33.850">The basics package and its contents great you can see that the license files included than there is the</p>

      <p begin="00:13:45.330" end="00:13:51.010">And, then we'll see that it just ...the contents of the vsix which was the manifest</p>

      <p begin="00:15:46.920" end="00:15:50.500">Let's go back in here.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:50.500" end="00:15:56.810">Let's start visual studio to actually see the extension sharp.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:56.810" end="00:16:01.610">Although it doesn't do anything meaningful we can still...it listed in extensions updates</p>

      <p begin="00:16:04.970" end="00:16:09.270">...because the extension was actually in started out of product and we maintain a</p>

      <p begin="00:16:13.570" end="00:16:18.030">restart bs for that reason you can see that the ext it was</p>
      <p begin="00:16:18.030" end="00:16:25.170">...in fact let me go ahead and install extension because they want to.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:25.170" end="00:16:28.040">Do something else as well which</p>
      <p begin="00:16:28.040" end="00:16:34.090">is to actually goal publish ...gallery?</p>

      <p begin="00:17:09.910" end="00:17:13.330">you picked and I just gave the extension that we just built it's pretty much</p>
      <p begin="00:17:13.330" end="00:17:18.270">...dummy extension does nothing much I hope you don't upload them extensions</p>

      <p begin="00:17:23.230" end="00:17:26.370">I'm going to delayed this extension right after that amos I'm going to give</p>
      <p begin="00:17:26.370" end="00:17:32.070">it some description which is not probably very meaningful here but,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:32.070" end="00:17:40.060">the reason why I'm giving this is so that you sort of.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:40.060" end="00:17:56.290">See the process here so.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:56.290" end="00:18:03.340">So, it's going about saving it's not published yet I'm going...publish.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:03.340" end="00:18:07.700">And, then lights published let me...check.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:07.700" end="00:18:10.710">If it's actually published from...</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.710" end="00:18:14.340">I'm going-to go-to online tag deception for the extensions</p>

      <p begin="00:18:56.840" end="00:19:00.180">The now...get back to.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:00.180" end="00:19:02.670">Slide to sort of wrap-up</p>
      <p begin="00:19:02.670" end="00:19:06.440">of the fast tiny little demo here so,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:06.440" end="00:19:12.620">what we ...so, far ...is we talk about what's in the</p>
      <p begin="00:19:12.620" end="00:19:16.170">vsix package manifest we did the publishing what we did not do is</p>
      <p begin="00:19:16.170" end="00:19:27.710">actually talk about the debugging and experimental instance select me?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:27.710" end="00:19:33.760">The same project and then we look at.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:33.760" end="00:19:36.920">Debugging specifically.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:36.920" end="00:19:41.220">So, let's look at.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:41.220" end="00:19:46.460">Debug properties for this project.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:46.460" end="00:19:52.050">So, shared enough ...is the action when you had debug is to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:52.050" end="00:19:54.830">...external program apparently okay and,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:54.830" end="00:19:59.940">then it says run devon dot...well that's visual studio so it says just...to your to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:59.940" end="00:20:03.440">run my extension project makes sense because you want extent extension</p>
      <p begin="00:20:03.440" end="00:20:08.940">...within visual studio cone because...that makes sense the next thing is area</p>
      <p begin="00:20:08.940" end="00:20:12.510">there's a command line argument as well that supplied which happens to be</p>
      <p begin="00:20:13.580" end="00:20:18.690">...exp what this says is experimental instances where this thing so</p>
      <p begin="00:20:18.690" end="00:20:24.790">what's experimental instance let's sort of take a moment to understand that and why that even</p>
      <p begin="00:20:24.790" end="00:20:27.620">exist?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:27.620" end="00:20:33.990">...experimental instance official studio is...you basically to...a different registry...case when</p>
      <p begin="00:20:33.990" end="00:20:40.250">we are looking at the if you remember we were looking at the...</p>
      <p begin="00:20:40.250" end="00:20:45.340">Hi, earlier so, the experimental instance has its own...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:45.340" end="00:20:49.550">the point of the this isolation not only does it have a</p>
      <p begin="00:20:49.550" end="00:20:52.050">high of its own the extensions also get installed</p>
      <p begin="00:20:52.050" end="00:20:57.530">...different location from the standard instance of</p>
      <p begin="00:20:57.530" end="00:21:02.000">visual studio the point of this isolation is so that you are development environment</p>
      <p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:07.730">...is distinctly separate from your debug environment so that if you</p>
      <p begin="00:21:07.730" end="00:21:12.090">had any extensions which are developing which are not good enough then that doesn't pollute...</p>
      <p begin="00:21:12.090" end="00:21:17.580">development environment and sort of getting to bad situations the other piece that you want also</p>
      <p begin="00:21:17.580" end="00:21:23.520">not make not...is all the extensions that...debugging and</p>
      <p begin="00:21:23.520" end="00:21:28.980">within the same experimental instance if you what building ten different extensions and,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:28.980" end="00:21:34.590">then all ten of them will showing this same experimental instance in itself so,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:34.590" end="00:21:38.840">with that let's actually see.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:38.840" end="00:21:46.760">How the debug experience...actually looks like so let's start debugging?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:46.760" end="00:21:58.250">And, then...stacked...we...studio experimental instance if we could studio.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:58.250" end="00:22:00.040">Not only does it start experimental instead</p>
      <p begin="00:22:00.040" end="00:22:05.680">...instance...studio it also goes about it...make sure that this experimental instance</p>
      <p begin="00:22:05.680" end="00:22:11.110">...studio has your extension installed so the one thing that you'll see is</p>
      <p begin="00:22:11.110" end="00:22:13.500">that title has experimental instance in here</p>
      <p begin="00:22:13.500" end="00:22:17.390">...regular visual studio obviously does not have that in the title and,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:17.390" end="00:22:25.270">then if you went and looked at extensions and updates you will see vsix project one.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:25.270" end="00:22:29.800">In here which was not the case.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:29.800" end="00:22:33.800">For the standard instance let's close this guy and, go back to slide deck</p>
      <p begin="00:22:33.800" end="00:22:39.980">and sort of summarize what recovered so far right so we covered these expected</p>
      <p begin="00:22:39.980" end="00:22:45.070">manifests what goes...package how easy and simply...for</p>
      <p begin="00:22:45.070" end="00:22:50.700">you to publisher package we also looked at the experimental instance and</p>
      <p begin="00:22:50.700" end="00:22:57.040">how that works as well the one little tidbit that might also</p>
      <p begin="00:22:57.040" end="00:23:02.080">be useful eventually he is looking at what happens the specific thing that</p>
      <p begin="00:23:02.080" end="00:23:06.710">have one of the specific things that happens when yet building</p>
      <p begin="00:23:06.710" end="00:23:10.290">...project which is for that will have to look at</p>
      <p begin="00:23:10.290" end="00:23:16.750">b cs project associated?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:16.750" end="00:23:21.710">For this project and, then the fun thing that I wanted to talk about is the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:21.710" end="00:23:26.640">...targets so, you extensibility project</p>
      <p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:31.340">inputs the...decay targets now.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:31.340" end="00:23:35.270">What does the targets well actually contain let's</p>
      <p begin="00:23:35.270" end="00:23:55.320">scope look up the targets file to get a sense of what's in there?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:55.320" end="00:23:58.070">So, the target file has a bunch of tasks if you're</p>
      <p begin="00:23:58.070" end="00:24:03.040">...as build architecture you probably understand what tasks do I'm not going to get into the details of him</p>
      <p begin="00:24:03.040" end="00:24:08.260">as build architecture and what not here what?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:08.260" end="00:24:14.010">Are the tasks...has done is a defines a bunch of tasks and,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:14.010" end="00:24:16.120">you'll notice that as part of building</p>
      <p begin="00:24:16.120" end="00:24:22.950">...basics project yep get stepped up the manifest gets validated and,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:22.950" end="00:24:28.450">the ext gets and installed and started back so it it's some useful source of information for</p>
      <p begin="00:24:28.450" end="00:24:32.290">you to go look at and if you're finding something that's unique...project</p>
      <p begin="00:24:32.290" end="00:24:41.370">build process then probably this is a place for you to start looking at?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:41.370" end="00:24:45.340">So, with that what I'm going to do it now is sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:24:45.340" end="00:24:52.260">switch gears and actually start adding some meaningful functionality to our project?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:52.260" end="00:24:57.590">So, what we'll do is real go about?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:58.910" end="00:25:02.110">And, new item.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:02.110" end="00:25:06.540">And, then what we're going to do is add and extensibility item and</p>
      <p begin="00:25:06.540" end="00:25:11.090">...data margin so what does this do basically this template like</p>
      <p begin="00:25:11.090" end="00:25:17.400">...is described here it creates a bit...editor margin that pleases?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:17.400" end="00:25:21.420">Green box across the bottom of...viewpoint so,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:21.420" end="00:25:24.110">that's what this get as so.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:24.110" end="00:25:26.100">Let's go about.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:26.100" end="00:25:27.440">Adding.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:34.220">Data...and, you'll see that the template ended up adding a bunch of</p>
      <p begin="00:25:34.220" end="00:25:34.720">references.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:37.310" end="00:25:42.110">Mostly do input...interfaces and start using interfaces that exposed by</p>
      <p begin="00:25:42.110" end="00:25:47.650">...and, then it added a couple of classes in here slated margin one</p>
      <p begin="00:25:47.650" end="00:25:52.720">...ts has constructor what the constructor does is basically it</p>
      <p begin="00:25:52.720" end="00:25:55.930">...label?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:55.930" end="00:25:58.870">Which...a background as light-green and that's a text</p>
      <p begin="00:25:58.870" end="00:26:03.420">to it okay now going to their...margin</p>
      <p begin="00:26:03.420" end="00:26:10.310">...factory cs it has?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:10.310" end="00:26:10.740">A method</p>
      <p begin="00:26:10.740" end="00:26:17.550">...which creates a margin the most interesting piece with this.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:17.550" end="00:26:20.750">Class...actually the fact that it has a</p>
      <p begin="00:26:20.750" end="00:26:27.000">bunch of attributes in here and that's what I think is most interesting for me in</p>
      <p begin="00:26:27.000" end="00:26:32.220">...and the one of the attributes here is the expert attribute ...get a sense of what</p>
      <p begin="00:26:32.220" end="00:26:37.820">these attributes mean and what not will have to look at math the managed extensibility framework but,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:37.820" end="00:26:43.100">before that let us just go about build this project?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:44.540" end="00:26:57.470">Run it to see the sort of functionality that it.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:57.470" end="00:27:04.340">Okay, so, we...experimental instance.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:04.340" end="00:27:08.800">And, just going to create a simple console application.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:08.800" end="00:27:13.710">So, that we have...file.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:13.710" end="00:27:47.560">And, then we can look at the editor margin once we open the client.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:47.560" end="00:27:51.780">Right so you see there it's functional yes it does something by adding...</p>
      <p begin="00:27:51.780" end="00:27:57.660">margin has some text here and then has...background for products</p>
      <p begin="00:27:57.660" end="00:28:03.830">let's close this guy and then start talking about what is</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.830" end="00:28:08.730">...so murphy's managed extensibility framework enables</p>
      <p begin="00:28:08.730" end="00:28:13.870">you to build extensible applications within extending that application would be as</p>
      <p begin="00:28:13.870" end="00:28:17.900">simple as dropping a bunch of binary store location and then</p>
      <p begin="00:28:18.990" end="00:28:22.510">...studio just pick up the binary is and then include it and,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:22.510" end="00:28:26.870">surface the functionality that you extension implements into yes basically right</p>
      <p begin="00:28:26.870" end="00:28:35.310">so that's sort of the capability that powerful capability of extensibility that nef provides?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:35.310" end="00:28:40.980">Right and this managed extensibility framework actually ships with dot net framework and you'll need system</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.980" end="00:28:42.950">dot co model namespaces</p>
      <p begin="00:28:42.950" end="00:28:49.790">where functionality for murphy's actually surfaced so let's sort of walk through</p>
      <p begin="00:28:51.140" end="00:28:56.810">a typical extensibility scenario rate in here we have an application and a couple of</p>
      <p begin="00:28:56.810" end="00:29:02.030">...extension and extension be extension...has a tool window</p>
      <p begin="00:29:02.030" end="00:29:07.660">...application could say well I need to windows extension be has a menu and,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:07.660" end="00:29:11.780">it's as I got a menu and then application could...I need menus and</p>
      <p begin="00:29:11.780" end="00:29:16.450">...consuming those menus in addition to that not only do these extensions actress have</p>
      <p begin="00:29:16.450" end="00:29:21.300">...the functionality they probably will also need some functionality like extension a might</p>
      <p begin="00:29:21.300" end="00:29:25.070">say I need a many accessories and application could say...got</p>
      <p begin="00:29:25.070" end="00:29:29.990">...service havel and gifts that...service back to extension and extension was about</p>
      <p begin="00:29:29.990" end="00:29:35.810">using that and for all practical purposes maybe some of the functionality of</p>
      <p begin="00:29:35.810" end="00:29:41.050">...semis isresult of the helped extension be provided by actually implementing a</p>
      <p begin="00:29:41.050" end="00:29:46.530">mania right similarly extension be could say I need a tool windows sideways and than</p>
      <p begin="00:29:46.530" end="00:29:49.850">the application...article windows...use it.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:51.340" end="00:29:56.200">So, that's sort of the model where in the extensions actually use some functionality within</p>
      <p begin="00:29:56.200" end="00:30:00.680">the application and they also provide some functionality to the application so,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:00.680" end="00:30:07.540">to sort of get these concepts little bit more concrete understanding of this concepts</p>
      <p begin="00:30:07.540" end="00:30:19.720">let's start looking at a demo project that they have.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:38.760" end="00:30:44.500">Ok, so, this demo project basically.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:44.500" end="00:30:48.960">The...does something similar to what we talked on the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:48.960" end="00:30:53.540">slide deck right it has defined a bunch of interfaces at</p>
      <p begin="00:30:53.540" end="00:30:59.330">tooling the interface menu interface and then it also defines the menu service</p>
      <p begin="00:30:59.330" end="00:31:05.870">encoding the service right and, then the?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:05.870" end="00:31:07.710">Program cs essentially has.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:09.350" end="00:31:11.400">A class some...window which implements the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:11.400" end="00:31:20.890">tool window interface the application which keeps track of all the.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:20.890" end="00:31:21.700">Right and,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:21.700" end="00:31:26.710">then a provide something to query the window.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:26.710" end="00:31:30.100">Given a name and then there is a menu...which implements their</p>
      <p begin="00:31:30.100" end="00:31:34.660">...surveys and then eventually data is this main method which sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:31:34.660" end="00:31:38.820">hooks up the...window the application menu service together</p>
      <p begin="00:31:38.820" end="00:31:43.040">...of seeing the application keeps track of all the cool windows</p>
      <p begin="00:31:43.040" end="00:31:48.970">today and menus...window get some...your service in this manner and,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:48.970" end="00:31:51.800">that's that and then this is essentially to sort of pool</p>
      <p begin="00:31:51.800" end="00:32:00.350">...now everything's hooked up...so let us around this.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:00.350" end="00:32:01.590">...app is a</p>
      <p begin="00:32:01.590" end="00:32:06.150">...that got created and then there's a menu...is that created okay fine.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:06.150" end="00:32:08.850">But, now let is until</p>
      <p begin="00:32:08.850" end="00:32:15.000">...situation here that now if some how you...is</p>
      <p begin="00:32:15.000" end="00:32:22.430">...another...winter than what would you do you would go about saying well?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:22.430" end="00:32:25.100">Tool winter tool.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:25.100" end="00:32:31.640">Thank is what we do and then you start listing that...winter too?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:31.640" end="00:32:35.020">In here.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:35.020" end="00:32:39.550">So, lot-of ugliness here advances start extending because now you have to not only do add this</p>
      <p begin="00:32:39.550" end="00:32:44.960">additional functionality but also actually have...changer application</p>
      <p begin="00:32:44.960" end="00:32:48.370">core to accomplish that now all fine if you controlled all of your</p>
      <p begin="00:32:48.370" end="00:32:51.950">...maybe that's still find recompile is fine but how about if you</p>
      <p begin="00:32:51.950" end="00:32:58.070">wanted your application to be extensible they'd then you would what would you do in the case</p>
      <p begin="00:32:58.070" end="00:33:02.520">within some extension author that wants to hook up to you and provide...little window</p>
      <p begin="00:33:02.520" end="00:33:08.350">...you have good bit invent...extensibility mechanism on how the application</p>
      <p begin="00:33:08.350" end="00:33:11.400">...that registers...windows invade usually those</p>
      <p begin="00:33:11.400" end="00:33:16.720">tool windows from that and that's sort of the problem that basically...of</p>
      <p begin="00:33:16.720" end="00:33:21.530">try to solve and solve in a very elegant manner using reflection</p>
      <p begin="00:33:21.530" end="00:33:30.180">and dot net reflection and whatnot so to see all of...action let's go about?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:30.180" end="00:33:32.150">Using methane that example</p>
      <p begin="00:33:32.150" end="00:33:42.390">...this sort of give you an overview of how simple that actually ends up looking.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:42.390" end="00:33:45.310">...so, had...to the component model composition</p>
      <p begin="00:33:46.570" end="00:34:04.170">...and then I'll...add a few using.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:20.650" end="00:34:23.550">And, then...also use.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:23.550" end="00:34:29.250">Deflection as well eventually so we added a few using</p>
      <p begin="00:34:29.250" end="00:34:32.870">...pull in a few types whereas.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:32.870" end="00:34:35.940">And, then I'm going to say the some...window basically</p>
      <p begin="00:34:35.940" end="00:34:40.470">...cycle window so how do I.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:40.470" end="00:34:48.120">Specify that they saying export.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:48.120" end="00:34:52.670">...if I did not specify type of ical window then by...could end up</p>
      <p begin="00:34:52.670" end="00:34:59.890">exporting some tool window the class but that's not what I want.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:59.890" end="00:35:01.230">You want...the interface.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:02.330" end="00:35:06.690">And, then the class out also actually.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:06.690" end="00:35:10.140">Needs menu service.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:10.140" end="00:35:18.010">So, I'm going to say I need that type of.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:18.010" end="00:35:19.190">...service.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:20.220" end="00:35:20.790">Right so that</p>
      <p begin="00:35:20.790" end="00:35:24.560">math now knows that okay this is another dependency that needs to be satisfied.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:26.440" end="00:35:30.650">The application.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:30.650" end="00:35:34.330">Many tool windows not just one so.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:34.330" end="00:35:36.590">...have built.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:36.590" end="00:35:49.150">Do then is used input many attribute and see that...</p>
      <p begin="00:35:49.150" end="00:35:50.850">Any...windows.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:50.850" end="00:35:53.100">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:53.100" end="00:35:55.490">And, then.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:55.490" end="00:36:05.960">Many service obviously.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:05.960" end="00:36:09.660">Thank box.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:09.660" end="00:36:13.290">I'm reading service.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:13.290" end="00:36:22.060">And, then it can ports many menus.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:32.930" end="00:36:38.450">...in then so we have added a few exports and imports to sort of declarative</p>
      <p begin="00:36:38.450" end="00:36:45.210">...specify dependencies what I'm going to do is I'm going to.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:45.210" end="00:36:47.200">The more all of the composition</p>
      <p begin="00:36:47.200" end="00:36:51.070">homemade composition and actually start using</p>
      <p begin="00:36:51.070" end="00:36:52.880">...aps stoke.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:52.880" end="00:36:56.200">Compose.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:56.200" end="00:36:58.620">I'm going to start off by creating.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.620" end="00:37:05.410">Catalog.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:05.410" end="00:37:15.910">And, that catalog is an assembly catalog ...from types that...</p>
      <p begin="00:37:15.910" end="00:37:17.960">The executing assembly.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:17.960" end="00:37:20.450">Current...only thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:20.450" end="00:37:25.260">That kind of something that building.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:25.260" end="00:37:45.050">And, then I'm going to create a container.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:04.340" end="00:38:08.740">And, then I'm going to compose a parts for the...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:08.740" end="00:38:24.840">then let's see if we can resolve this complet as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:24.840" end="00:38:32.780">...on key there and that's okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:32.780" end="00:38:36.340">Application obviously has a.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:36.340" end="00:38:43.110">Get...so I'm going to get...using the name.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:43.110" end="00:38:46.500">...days what they specified as the name.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:46.500" end="00:38:47.820">Thank.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:47.820" end="00:38:54.190">You hit some ideas that.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:55.370" end="00:39:00.220">...stack so now let as a sort of take a moment to sort of understand</p>
      <p begin="00:39:00.220" end="00:39:07.250">what's going on here in these field lines of code that.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:07.250" end="00:39:11.580">...building the...the assembly catalog classing here is doing is</p>
      <p begin="00:39:11.580" end="00:39:16.440">it's going about enumerating all the types methods fields that has</p>
      <p begin="00:39:16.440" end="00:39:20.880">...input...defined on it and then create a collection of composer</p>
      <p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:25.230">...that's a compose able part it's a compressible unit in</p>
      <p begin="00:39:25.230" end="00:39:29.630">...basically rate in other words like a compressible park holds information regarding either</p>
      <p begin="00:39:29.630" end="00:39:35.590">an input of an expert unit and then...composition container on the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:35.590" end="00:39:40.750">catalog what happened was the completion container gets the exports from the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:42.180" end="00:39:48.990">And, then the exports imap the inputs once we do the compose part.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:48.990" end="00:39:54.120">So, that's the matchmaking process essentially happens when...the...parts...all the dependencies</p>
      <p begin="00:39:54.120" end="00:39:59.050">as satisfied well the succeeds basically right and then we now have access to the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:59.050" end="00:40:02.700">...window as well ...of also look at</p>
      <p begin="00:40:02.700" end="00:40:08.580">...fun thing with...let's.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:08.580" end="00:40:26.810">Go about enumerating all the parts.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:26.810" end="00:40:35.950">So, what we're going...do is?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:35.950" end="00:40:39.540">...going to look at all expert definitions and then we're going to just paint.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:39.540" end="00:40:50.340">All the all of them.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:15.760" end="00:41:51.330">Okay,...was a...failures say probably missed something.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:51.330" end="00:41:54.190">Until window doesn't hem...means said...</p>
      <p begin="00:41:55.240" end="00:42:04.960">So, for now let...this out we can get to innovate.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:09.230">The point that I wanted to show was actually a cool wind itself.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:09.230" end="00:42:15.260">Can be access I mean we can access...windows from the application which is the case</p>
      <p begin="00:42:15.260" end="00:42:18.720">And, we were able to enumerate the exports as well</p>
      <p begin="00:42:19.780" end="00:42:28.910">...purposes I'm going to keep rolling but,...with our current talk so,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:28.910" end="00:42:33.160">If you remember we talked about the extension needing a menu</p>
      <p begin="00:42:33.160" end="00:42:37.180">service and application saying that well I got a menu service</p>
      <p begin="00:42:37.180" end="00:42:40.280">well that translates to sort of import-export from</p>
      <p begin="00:42:40.280" end="00:42:45.620">...terminology that everything is a pocket from a wealth...standpoint</p>
      <p begin="00:42:45.620" end="00:42:50.410">...extensions that...parts and your applications and is a...everything is apart</p>
      <p begin="00:42:54.750" end="00:42:59.880">Now let's take a moment to talk about what we have covered so</p>
      <p begin="00:42:59.880" end="00:43:04.880">...with regards to...when we're dealing with nef we need to understand that parts expert</p>
      <p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:10.210">something...then there is a composition that puts it all together</p>
      <p begin="00:43:10.210" end="00:43:15.380">to accomplish that dairies catalog that keeps track of all the providers of</p>
      <p begin="00:43:15.380" end="00:43:22.220">functionality there is a container that plays the role of matchmaking by finding exports</p>
      <p begin="00:43:22.220" end="00:43:28.370">and...and, satisfies the inputs we looked at that somebody catalog in this example</p>
      <p begin="00:43:28.370" end="00:43:33.610">...as well like the...catalog which is sort of what gets use when you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:43:33.610" end="00:43:39.240">...your extensions...directly location then you basically have a direct catalog and,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:39.240" end="00:43:41.900">the...gets built based on all the</p>
      <p begin="00:43:41.900" end="00:43:46.750">...assemblies that in that specific directly that you're looking at it also that</p>
      <p begin="00:43:46.750" end="00:43:52.950">advanced concepts like lazy inputs and, specifying metadata</p>
      <p begin="00:43:54.280" end="00:43:59.440">on...as well that have not covered thosefor your on study at some point of</p>
      <p begin="00:43:59.440" end="00:44:05.190">...but the point for me here was to actually give you an overview of...</p>
      <p begin="00:44:05.190" end="00:44:11.180">why does visual studio use ...to make its own extensibility ...simple</p>
      <p begin="00:44:11.180" end="00:44:16.860">bankrupting extension not that's create partition and modular pieces of functionality has</p>
      <p begin="00:44:16.860" end="00:44:21.960">we have seen miffed brings that the ability to compose functionality easily</p>
      <p begin="00:44:21.960" end="00:44:26.920">ending creators designing and implementing completely de-couple pieces of software?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:26.920" end="00:44:32.260">Which is ideal from and extensibility standpoint these design patents make it possible to create maintain able</p>
      <p begin="00:44:32.260" end="00:44:42.510">software in the long-run so now let's go back to our editor margin example?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:42.510" end="00:44:47.460">Switch over to that and, then start looking at the.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:47.460" end="00:44:48.850">Attributes</p>
      <p begin="00:44:48.850" end="00:44:55.130">...specific attributes right in here what we're saying is ...</p>
      <p begin="00:44:55.130" end="00:44:58.220">Is that it saying that well this classic sports the aida</p>
      <p begin="00:44:58.220" end="00:45:02.830">...text...margin provide at night and,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:02.830" end="00:45:08.350">then the editor obviously inputs all the?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:08.350" end="00:45:14.090">All the entities all the parts that sdp is specify</p>
      <p begin="00:45:14.090" end="00:45:16.930">...margin toyed it and then what it does based on that</p>
      <p begin="00:45:16.930" end="00:45:21.330">is then it goes about creating margin on those...and that happens</p>
      <p begin="00:45:21.330" end="00:45:26.800">...today extension actually got the opportunity to had the background</p>
      <p begin="00:45:26.800" end="00:45:28.680">and text thank and,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:28.680" end="00:45:33.460">also there was another attribute a few attributes that are of interest here that data</p>
      <p begin="00:45:33.460" end="00:45:38.920">case about the specify that this is a...this is applicable for...content type</p>
      <p begin="00:45:38.920" end="00:45:44.330">...also specified that this is applicable...for the bottom marginally</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.330" end="00:45:49.510">okay and, we also gave it a name as well up here?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:49.510" end="00:45:56.040">That's that additional...provided now.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:56.040" end="00:46:00.980">So, I wanted also...a couple of things that are specific to</p>
      <p begin="00:46:00.980" end="00:46:05.430">...studios usage...</p>
      <p begin="00:46:05.430" end="00:46:06.010">So, what</p>
      <p begin="00:46:06.010" end="00:46:11.520">visual studio does is a venue user basics package to install extension</p>
      <p begin="00:46:11.520" end="00:46:16.620">...basics instead of comes along installs the package to the extensions for...basically</p>
      <p begin="00:46:16.620" end="00:46:20.330">...extensions for that...and, then when</p>
      <p begin="00:46:20.330" end="00:46:26.140">...sets it up so that on subsequently start because to...understands that and...and start and,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:26.140" end="00:46:31.830">then visual studio will go about scanning extensions for that and when it does that it obviously</p>
      <p begin="00:46:31.830" end="00:46:36.300">...calls the compose parts to build a...and after that what it also</p>
      <p begin="00:46:36.300" end="00:46:40.950">does it make sure that it updates its on cache of extensions and them...cash that it</p>
      <p begin="00:46:40.950" end="00:46:45.320">...that keeps the point of the cash is so that it doesn't scanned extensions for</p>
      <p begin="00:46:45.320" end="00:46:48.680">...all the time on a restart...does that only when</p>
      <p begin="00:46:48.680" end="00:46:52.330">an extension was installed previously?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:53.630" end="00:46:59.280">So, that's sort of something that needs sort of unique to how visual studio manages</p>
      <p begin="00:47:00.490" end="00:47:03.710">miffed based extensions.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:03.710" end="00:47:09.220">So, now switching gas we're going to look at visual studio packages and how networks</p>
      <p begin="00:47:10.620" end="00:47:16.050">...start to get started what we'll do is...add a menu item and commanded gets executed</p>
      <p begin="00:47:16.050" end="00:47:20.990">when the usertaxonomy item in the process I hope to provide you an overview of</p>
      <p begin="00:47:20.990" end="00:47:25.990">...extensibility concepts like package...package registration command routing</p>
      <p begin="00:47:27.590" end="00:47:31.330">that will help you when you look at creating abs package yourself at a</p>
      <p begin="00:47:31.330" end="00:47:33.520">high-level bs package is a means</p>
      <p begin="00:47:33.520" end="00:47:37.880">for extension author to provide common extensibility objects in a container that is</p>
      <p begin="00:47:37.880" end="00:47:42.200">deployed and licensed as a single entity basically functionality surface</p>
      <p begin="00:47:42.200" end="00:47:45.000">...package can be used by other objects in the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:45.000" end="00:47:51.470">...package or in another package in terms of types of things that you could do you could write your</p>
      <p begin="00:47:51.470" end="00:47:55.790">...salaries and, you would provide that envious package you</p>
      <p begin="00:47:55.790" end="00:48:00.990">...as could previous packages visual studios editor itself is</p>
      <p begin="00:48:00.990" end="00:48:06.560">...package in project systems audio elements like manual and,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:06.560" end="00:48:12.470">tool windows those called so would be in bs packages...so without</p>
      <p begin="00:48:12.470" end="00:48:17.270">let us transition to a simple demo variable...in your comment?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:17.270" end="00:48:22.360">Some back to add demo project that we've been using so far we are going to continue</p>
      <p begin="00:48:22.360" end="00:48:29.970">an...new extensibility item.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:29.970" end="00:48:38.700">And, we're going to add a custom command.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:38.700" end="00:48:41.680">And, we'll see that ...a bunch of</p>
      <p begin="00:48:41.680" end="00:48:46.640">...that can be added and a few files that will be added as a result of this so,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:50.860">the differences that added here you'll see that data...immutable and</p>
      <p begin="00:48:50.860" end="00:48:54.930">...interrupt somebody that added we need those for some coding</p>
      <p begin="00:48:54.930" end="00:48:59.880">...types for shel interfaces structures and classes and</p>
      <p begin="00:48:59.880" end="00:49:05.060">photo packaged registration attributes now let's look at</p>
      <p begin="00:49:05.060" end="00:49:10.340">thesource code that was added as a result of this so let's look at command</p>
      <p begin="00:49:10.340" end="00:49:12.960">when packaged cs.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:16.440">Thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:16.440" end="00:49:20.560">You'll see that it has a few attributes.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:20.560" end="00:49:24.020">And, then the package itself inhibits from.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:24.020" end="00:49:28.220">Microsoft visual studio...package...</p>
      <p begin="00:49:28.220" end="00:49:33.210">And, you'll notice that there is a...here in the constructed so,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.210" end="00:49:40.520">that's something of but, making not off so, what we what it's</p>
      <p begin="00:49:40.520" end="00:49:45.250">saying here...tells us that we can...initialization what sort of initialization</p>
      <p begin="00:49:45.250" end="00:49:49.470">...can going here and what cannot and it says that it</p>
      <p begin="00:49:49.470" end="00:49:53.440">talks about something called package...date so,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:53.440" end="00:49:55.030">what...sedate?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:56.820" end="00:50:00.840">And, what is package...mean that's something that we</p>
      <p begin="00:50:00.840" end="00:50:06.380">would I would want to take a moment to talk about then we develop a package it is modular unit</p>
      <p begin="00:50:06.380" end="00:50:12.160">...functionality right ...it is loaded...studio it becomes part of visual</p>
      <p begin="00:50:12.160" end="00:50:16.980">...itself so, what does that mean well, if</p>
      <p begin="00:50:16.980" end="00:50:22.440">you're developing something which is module of its own like...and regular some</p>
      <p begin="00:50:22.440" end="00:50:28.140">...that gets loaded by a regular application then?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:28.140" end="00:50:31.260">The application just uses the functionality that's provided by the</p>
      <p begin="00:50:31.260" end="00:50:34.150">ideal of it's unlikely that the dl use</p>
      <p begin="00:50:34.150" end="00:50:39.350">...some of the functionality that's in the application that's the distinction between</p>
      <p begin="00:50:39.350" end="00:50:43.270">...package and the regular modules in when you build</p>
      <p begin="00:50:43.270" end="00:50:47.920">...package not only does vs use the functionality that surfaced by that</p>
      <p begin="00:50:47.920" end="00:50:52.650">we as package between as packaging itself also starts</p>
      <p begin="00:50:52.650" end="00:50:56.240">has the ability to consume and use the functionality that these envious</p>
      <p begin="00:50:56.240" end="00:51:01.120">and also from other...packages as well so what?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:01.120" end="00:51:04.690">Package...does here essentially is that</p>
      <p begin="00:51:06.500" end="00:51:11.010">then the packages after the packages...essentially becomes part of</p>
      <p begin="00:51:11.010" end="00:51:15.770">...pretty before...is a sighted that does not happen so, for the package to be</p>
      <p begin="00:51:15.770" end="00:51:19.650">...you should actually have implemented the ideas package interface that's</p>
      <p begin="00:51:19.650" end="00:51:25.030">something that we get for free here because we just inherited from the package class.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:25.030" end="00:51:30.940">...studio eventually...as per initialize as well after the packages</p>
      <p begin="00:51:30.940" end="00:51:33.900">...so at this point we can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:51:33.900" end="00:51:36.930">...method is called we can actually start using some of this at</p>
      <p begin="00:51:36.930" end="00:51:41.490">...that...part of visual studio so let's go take a look at the</p>
      <p begin="00:51:41.490" end="00:51:44.160">command one initialize because that's what gets card.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:45.190" end="00:51:48.830">Not initialize method for come bs becoming</p>
      <p begin="00:51:48.830" end="00:51:52.440">...package essentially...will see that the constructor</p>
      <p begin="00:51:52.440" end="00:51:58.550">...card and the constructive actually users...so, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:58.550" end="00:52:03.430">...able to actually axis medius from within...package some of the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:03.430" end="00:52:09.960">services colombia's and the what it does here is pretty minimal</p>
      <p begin="00:52:09.960" end="00:52:12.920">rate what it does is it adds the command and the come</p>
      <p begin="00:52:12.920" end="00:52:16.630">...essentially a command ad...even handler and,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:16.630" end="00:52:21.690">then it adds that to the comment...so that no...service...when I use</p>
      <p begin="00:52:21.690" end="00:52:26.870">...a specific command call this even-handed basically so,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:26.870" end="00:52:31.330">that's what has happened so now let as.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:31.330" end="00:52:39.010">Look, at another piece of information they by going back to the.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:39.010" end="00:52:43.590">...when package.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:43.590" end="00:52:48.590">...here we looked at this packaged registration...what this what this</p>
      <p begin="00:52:48.590" end="00:52:53.440">...registration attribute does is it what it</p>
      <p begin="00:52:53.440" end="00:52:58.410">is singing here is that...the resources for this the ll are not in settler...cities in the same</p>
      <p begin="00:52:58.410" end="00:53:02.340">...data things that you can specify using the packages</p>
      <p begin="00:53:02.340" end="00:53:06.480">...registration attribute things like that this</p>
      <p begin="00:53:06.480" end="00:53:11.180">package can be loaded in the background in a different tradeoff not the</p>
      <p begin="00:53:11.180" end="00:53:15.970">install product registration attribute basically...that provide information so that it shows</p>

      <p begin="00:53:27.140" end="00:53:32.600">That are built from the...city file now what is obviously fell we'll get to that in a minute that</p>

      <p begin="00:53:37.700" end="00:53:42.070">dirty menu and here's the version of the...the point of versioning</p>
      <p begin="00:53:42.070" end="00:53:47.670">their resources essentially for the...studio caching so that we should studio</p>
      <p begin="00:53:47.670" end="00:53:51.260">...means performant and doesn't have to look up</p>
      <p begin="00:53:51.260" end="00:53:55.150">the resources all the time every...loaded but,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:55.150" end="00:53:57.650">only when actually the version changes?</p>
      <p begin="00:53:58.820" end="00:54:02.430">Right so that's goodness from a performance standpoint so now going to</p>
      <p begin="00:54:02.430" end="00:54:03.940">the via cp file.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:05.390" end="00:54:07.870">Itself what is the city file well it's a</p>
      <p begin="00:54:07.870" end="00:54:13.700">...table and, what's in what's in it.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:13.700" end="00:54:22.550">...let's start by looking at line-by-line sort of there is this</p>
      <p begin="00:54:22.550" end="00:54:27.240">...dot h and what does that file actually have it has</p>
      <p begin="00:54:27.240" end="00:54:36.210">a command id ...all the menus in ...commands so,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:36.210" end="00:54:41.490">that's defined in dead-end for if you were interested in looking up at all the</p>
      <p begin="00:54:41.490" end="00:54:48.040">...information that's the header...for you to go look</p>
      <p begin="00:54:48.040" end="00:54:53.330">Other important elemental you to pay attention to is sort of the</p>
      <p begin="00:54:53.330" end="00:54:53.830">commands.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:54.870" end="00:54:58.400">The node the commands that associated with the package</p>
      <p begin="00:54:58.400" end="00:55:01.260">...package identified uniquely by a good</p>
      <p begin="00:55:01.260" end="00:55:07.400">...and that's what specified here and that good is defined.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:07.400" end="00:55:09.320">In the symbol section.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:09.320" end="00:55:11.940">Right so that's what.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:11.940" end="00:55:15.850">Identifies the comments and then the</p>
      <p begin="00:55:15.850" end="00:55:21.260">commands element in itself has obviously if your children in here.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:21.260" end="00:55:26.030">Most notably three groups buttons and...great</p>
      <p begin="00:55:26.030" end="00:55:29.710">...element is used to group related command groups</p>
      <p begin="00:55:30.850" end="00:55:35.860">...not case we have only one command...and then each group is tighter</p>
      <p begin="00:55:35.860" end="00:55:40.860">...menu group and then what we're saying is spell I'm adding a new group on the cools manual</p>
      <p begin="00:55:42.070" end="00:55:46.780">okay that's what this is defining and you have the buttons</p>
      <p begin="00:55:46.780" end="00:55:50.570">the element...the buttons element you can specify the buttons and,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:50.570" end="00:55:54.140">you try a button group?</p>
      <p begin="00:55:54.140" end="00:55:58.000">...command eighty and then you see that this is part of this</p>
      <p begin="00:55:58.000" end="00:56:00.410">...group.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:00.410" end="00:56:09.490">And, you also specify...which is a bitmap in this case.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:09.490" end="00:56:13.830">Okay, so, now that...sort of lebed the.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:13.830" end="00:56:19.190">Overall high-level taxonomy off the cp file it as</p>
      <p begin="00:56:20.200" end="00:56:39.690">Demo...sort of...what going on.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:39.690" end="00:56:44.460">Okay, so, we have.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:44.460" end="00:56:45.810">Added.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:45.810" end="00:56:49.840">Menu command obviously and then it does something which is just through the</p>
      <p begin="00:56:49.840" end="00:56:52.750">dialogue box in there.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:52.750" end="00:56:56.960">So, that's all this...so now let is go back to</p>
      <p begin="00:56:56.960" end="00:56:59.260">...sort of look at.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:59.260" end="00:57:05.750">What happened behind-the-scenes in terms of building this package basically so,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:05.750" end="00:57:10.800">we start off with the resource files the rest xfiles bs package</p>
      <p begin="00:57:10.800" end="00:57:16.630">...and resources gutless x and, those are those are basically process...as jan</p>
      <p begin="00:57:16.630" end="00:57:21.770">...the to create the dot resource files then the dot me a city file that we looked at</p>
      <p begin="00:57:21.770" end="00:57:28.890">...processed by...is the command table compiler and then...generates a dot</p>
      <p begin="00:57:28.890" end="00:57:30.470">And, then that dot seo</p>
      <p begin="00:57:30.470" end="00:57:35.280">...added to the bs package dot resource file and the name of that</p>
      <p begin="00:57:35.280" end="00:57:39.350">resources work be specified in here.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:39.350" end="00:57:45.190">And, it also has a question that we specified in here right and then.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:45.190" end="00:57:50.130">The resource file and the source...are processed by the csharp compiler to generate that</p>
      <p begin="00:57:51.580" end="00:57:55.960">The assembly file is then processed by the create package difficult...to generate</p>
      <p begin="00:57:55.960" end="00:58:01.540">...package...in our case.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:01.540" end="00:58:03.770">We can.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:03.770" end="00:58:20.430">Look, at the package...file that god created.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:20.430" end="00:58:28.020">So,...what it has is it has the package grid that we looked at it has the.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:28.020" end="00:58:32.360">The ll which contains the functionality it also has information on the menu</p>
      <p begin="00:58:32.360" end="00:58:36.020">...is located and that sort of what stuff so this is what get</p>
      <p begin="00:58:36.020" end="00:58:44.020">...and separating in determining whether it needs to rebuild its manual cash have...</p>
      <p begin="00:58:44.020" end="00:58:49.550">And, then the package the file and,...files that were generated out processed by the</p>
      <p begin="00:58:49.550" end="00:58:51.660">...tasks.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:51.660" end="00:58:54.420">And, then to generate the basics package.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:56.620" end="00:59:01.850">...let as a switch to a simple to dwindle...how easy it is for you to create a</p>
      <p begin="00:59:01.850" end="00:59:12.500">...as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:12.500" end="00:59:19.180">And, in the process I'll also try to demo how you could change the</p>
      <p begin="00:59:19.180" end="00:59:25.640">state of your commands as well right so it...window and then I am</p>
      <p begin="00:59:25.640" end="00:59:32.680">looking at the even handler for that will...I'm going to hack up some thing?</p>
      <p begin="00:59:32.680" end="00:59:39.330">But, a sort of moving this menu command.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:39.330" end="00:59:41.070">To be at class.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:41.070" end="00:59:51.860">To...to be the to be a member of this class.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:51.860" end="00:59:54.080">So, that...can access directly.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:55.230" end="01:00:02.570">Not that great solution but, sort of.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:02.570" end="01:00:16.390">Something to sort of demo what I'm trying to accomplish here.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:16.390" end="01:00:18.460">So, I'm going to say.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:18.460" end="01:00:24.270">I'm going to keep coddling.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:24.270" end="01:00:31.280">I'm going to keep targeting the.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:31.280" end="01:00:35.650">...the other...that we also need to do to be able to accomplish that</p>
      <p begin="01:00:35.650" end="01:00:40.960">he's to change and add command flag.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:42.230" end="01:00:48.160">To say that this is this ...needs dynamic visibility so that you can change</p>
      <p begin="01:00:49.340" end="01:01:08.570">All right so, we did that and then I'm going to...</p>
      <p begin="01:01:08.570" end="01:01:10.250">And, then the cool window was actually.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:11.820" end="01:01:16.600">Added we didn't get to that...can here.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:16.600" end="01:01:18.750">Many itemize...sort of getting the to</p>
      <p begin="01:01:18.750" end="01:01:23.110">...right and then you can see that the new</p>
      <p begin="01:01:23.110" end="01:01:29.700">...is visible in here I'm going to.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:29.700" end="01:01:32.210">Make it invisible.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:32.210" end="01:01:37.670">Thank you visible okay.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:37.670" end="01:01:42.560">So, we detach pretty simple...window you can add...as well but I want</p>
      <p begin="01:01:42.560" end="01:01:47.280">to sort of take a moment to talk about basic command handling concepts here.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:47.280" end="01:01:52.280">...what's a command, command is a logical entity that represents an action that a</p>
      <p begin="01:01:52.280" end="01:01:56.720">...to perform it is backed by code to accomplish</p>
      <p begin="01:01:56.720" end="01:02:01.130">the action button is ui invoke the command.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:02.170" end="01:02:07.380">Context is something that represents the state of environment we have not leverage to that yet in</p>
      <p begin="01:02:07.380" end="01:02:09.280">a demos for instance</p>
      <p begin="01:02:09.280" end="01:02:13.590">...commands that enabled only in certain contexts will look at context</p>
      <p begin="01:02:13.590" end="01:02:18.560">in a moment an example is a step into is</p>
      <p begin="01:02:18.560" end="01:02:23.370">...your debugging right state will get the visibility state there are</p>
      <p begin="01:02:23.370" end="01:02:27.950">other states like enable disabled so command can habits on state basic and</p>
      <p begin="01:02:27.950" end="01:02:32.880">then command target he is an entity that knows how to execute...status query</p>
      <p begin="01:02:32.880" end="01:02:36.940">...action associated with the command the...target could execute</p>
      <p begin="01:02:36.940" end="01:02:41.520">action could projected of routed to another target?</p>
      <p begin="01:02:41.520" end="01:02:46.650">And, finally the action is the code that is executed by a command target pena</p>
      <p begin="01:02:46.650" end="01:02:51.850">...days executed on it.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:51.850" end="01:02:57.320">So,...let us look, at contexts a little bit so what we're going to</p>
      <p begin="01:02:57.320" end="01:03:03.740">do is one final demo vision before...wrapping things up.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:03.740" end="01:03:08.630">So, what we're going to do here he is?</p>
      <p begin="01:03:08.630" end="01:03:13.550">I'm going to add.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:13.550" end="01:03:19.800">Visibility constraint.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:19.800" end="01:03:22.560">On visibility...</p>
      <p begin="01:03:23.630" end="01:03:24.770">Great.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:24.770" end="01:03:36.090">Pain that I'm going to specify.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:36.090" end="01:03:48.090">Command and that's a combination of the...and then the I.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:48.090" end="01:03:58.270">And, then I'm going to specify in what context...going to be visible.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:08.790" end="01:04:18.370">Okay, and, what I'm going to do also is...</p>
      <p begin="01:04:18.370" end="01:04:26.040">This so that it starch direct so that ...to...that it needs to.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:26.040" end="01:04:38.230">Updates menus.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:38.230" end="01:04:42.370">So, what we did there was we said that this is this menu should be visible only</p>
      <p begin="01:04:42.370" end="01:04:45.940">...there is no solution?</p>
      <p begin="01:04:45.940" end="01:04:50.020">Noted and if there is a solution loaded...don't trick...solution loaded search</p>
      <p begin="01:04:50.020" end="01:04:55.910">...this thing up selects load up a solution and see if that works and if</p>
      <p begin="01:04:55.910" end="01:05:00.810">...basically...tools...</p>
      <p begin="01:05:00.810" end="01:05:04.690">Ok, solutions loaded.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:04.690" end="01:05:06.620">Not there anymore.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:06.620" end="01:05:11.300">So, we saw how context is also functional now.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:11.300" end="01:05:15.720">So, from command visibility...different things you...we just looked at the not solution you could also to the</p>
      <p begin="01:05:15.720" end="01:05:19.070">...make it visible on given that is empty solution,</p>
      <p begin="01:05:19.070" end="01:05:24.900">solution exists a bunch of things that you could do in here in terms of a visibility setting the</p>
      <p begin="01:05:24.900" end="01:05:29.070">visibility like if...make sure that this command is available only when you're running in full-screen more,</p>
      <p begin="01:05:29.070" end="01:05:30.510">for example.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:30.510" end="01:05:36.830">...back what we have done so far is we looked at prefix</p>
      <p begin="01:05:38.790" end="01:05:43.720">we looked at the basics manifest and how the sixes actually installed and whatnot places to look</p>
      <p begin="01:05:43.720" end="01:05:48.720">at...you encountering issues between six...mat-file how to leverage it and build</p>
      <p begin="01:05:48.720" end="01:05:53.070">...based extensions we looked bs packages and,</p>
      <p begin="01:05:53.070" end="01:05:55.750">the oral architecture...package what this packet</p>
      <p begin="01:05:55.750" end="01:06:00.540">...means we also looked at the manuals and commands how</p>
      <p begin="01:06:00.540" end="01:06:05.350">to associate them we also them and we just used a few extensions like</p>
      <p begin="01:06:05.350" end="01:06:11.130">...just a simple edit and...based extensions then we uploaded</p>
      <p begin="01:06:11.130" end="01:06:15.440">extension...extension to gallery and sort of said how easy it is for you to</p>
      <p begin="01:06:15.440" end="01:06:20.790">upload your extensions to gallery what more can you extend you can do a whole lot of things</p>
      <p begin="01:06:20.790" end="01:06:26.240">like project templates can be customize the extent...extensible code snippets you can</p>

      <p begin="01:06:54.630" end="01:07:00.150">studio professional so that's the place where you start if you're building extensions and some</p>
      <p begin="01:07:00.150" end="01:07:06.400">resources on math as well for you to go look at I hope you enjoyed the talk and,</p>
