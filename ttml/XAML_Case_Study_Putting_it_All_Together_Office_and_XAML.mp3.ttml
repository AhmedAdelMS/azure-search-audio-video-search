      <p begin="00:00:03.590" end="00:00:09.370">Hello, everyone welcome to office and...it all together I'd like to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.370" end="00:00:13.400">...and the session is also been streamed on channel nine so I'd like</p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.400" end="00:00:16.980">...bank the audience watching online as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.980" end="00:00:22.270">So, today I'm jason morse with me today is andru coats and work from the office</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.270" end="00:00:27.540">core experiences team office client effectively and we work</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.540" end="00:00:34.700">on building universal office apps out of our legacy cplus-plus code base.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.700" end="00:00:39.350">So, at the end of the session will bring up the evaluation slide this is standard but please</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.350" end="00:00:46.520">evaluate the session we'd love to hear feedback and, we hope this session really is useful...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.520" end="00:00:48.630">So, today main focus is</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.630" end="00:00:53.240">going to be on our approach to universal applicationshow office built the</p>
      <p begin="00:00:53.240" end="00:00:56.070">...of universal applications we're going to talk about</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.070" end="00:01:01.930">a high-level approach some of our philosophy we're going to dive into details as well,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.930" end="00:01:04.360">some of the stuff we do is a little esoteric</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.360" end="00:01:08.370">out we're going to try to have enough details especially in the realm</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.370" end="00:01:14.080">of integrating with cplus-plus integrating with your legacy code and,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.080" end="00:01:16.790">integrated with some of your high-value content?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.790" end="00:01:20.400">I will start off by talking about our values</p>
      <p begin="00:01:20.400" end="00:01:23.630">our approach this is sort of the context or the lens</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.630" end="00:01:27.110">...which we view building these applications and the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.110" end="00:01:33.050">...I'm going to talk about where the applications are today you know-how they're going what are approaches</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.050" end="00:01:38.460">are where you can get them various things like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.460" end="00:01:42.230">So, to start off a throughout the conference and you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.230" end="00:01:45.340">I've been sitting on...sessions as well there's been a lot of great stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.340" end="00:01:50.360">about it's really easy to build applications it's really easy to do this you can do all this</p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.360" end="00:01:55.260">stuff really quickly and that's great and that's actually really great for developers but</p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.260" end="00:02:00.380">...the office perspective we don't care about easy or we do but it's not</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.380" end="00:02:03.290">our top priority,... for us quality</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.290" end="00:02:08.270">of experience for the user trumps everything and if it's more expensive were willing to make</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.270" end="00:02:13.830">pay that cost were willing to do that if it yields better experience.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:18.700">So, to start with background...office and I know everyone has some opinions and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.700" end="00:02:22.550">previous...office but there are many words people</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.550" end="00:02:27.410">used to describe office some of them positive some of them maybe not so positive</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.410" end="00:02:30.810">I see some smiles out there I'll pick up some I'll put</p>
      <p begin="00:02:30.810" end="00:02:36.850">up some more positive words for it so that we don't have any suggestions but,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.850" end="00:02:41.290">functional powerful you know, we're talking about office the desktop version</p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.290" end="00:02:44.770">...thirty-two version classic office and this context</p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.770" end="00:02:49.610">...it is big and complicated it can do a ton of stuff that has a ton</p>
      <p begin="00:02:49.610" end="00:02:53.950">of our and we really believe in the value of that even today.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.950" end="00:02:58.810">But, when you talk about mobile applications that may be is not which are looking for,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.810" end="00:02:59.550">you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.550" end="00:03:05.050">if any of you solve...theorems talk yesterday about them performance they</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.050" end="00:03:10.520">used analogy of building a car and when you build a mobile application you want to build a sports car you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:10.520" end="00:03:16.130">build...high-performance fasten might car what office isn't really a</p>
      <p begin="00:03:16.130" end="00:03:22.910">sports car maybe more like a bus...maybe not this bus you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.910" end="00:03:27.750">it's more like an executive coach or is airforce one was a bus it would be that bus,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.750" end="00:03:31.000">you know, it's got features it's got satellite hookup you can live your life</p>
      <p begin="00:03:31.000" end="00:03:34.740">and that bus but it's not small and nimble?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.740" end="00:03:40.250">And, we have gotten it to go pretty fast it considering how big it is</p>
      <p begin="00:03:40.250" end="00:03:44.880">considering how much it does office actually really boots and,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.880" end="00:03:47.630">moves along pretty quickly I did look for rocket</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47.630" end="00:03:53.720">...slides but apparently that was not available on the internet shockingly.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.720" end="00:03:57.760">So,...we talk about office and we talk about it in mobile context</p>
      <p begin="00:03:58.930" end="00:04:04.900">people just don't think of it as fast and light and that's something we really need to change.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.900" end="00:04:08.250">Looking at our code base our code base is...all</p>
      <p begin="00:04:08.250" end="00:04:13.070">native code base now we have some manage application code for extensibility</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.070" end="00:04:18.230">but in the normal code flow is completely native and that is mostly cplus-plus.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.230" end="00:04:20.950">It's thirty-years-old it started off</p>
      <p begin="00:04:20.950" end="00:04:25.710">as predominately see and it's evolved over that time the new standards</p>
      <p begin="00:04:25.710" end="00:04:29.720">and cplus-plus are actually really exciting to us people</p>
      <p begin="00:04:29.720" end="00:04:35.350">...changing code over quickly the way we do things are changing and,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:35.350" end="00:04:38.870">it's something that this code is old but it continues to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.870" end="00:04:43.850">evolve and I'm sure for many of you who have large legacy code bases that's true</p>
      <p begin="00:04:43.850" end="00:04:49.620">it's not completely static it has grown though it's gotten bigger and bigger and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.620" end="00:04:53.580">right for...set up the stack I asked for a current count was</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53.580" end="00:04:56.690">...hundred seventy one million lines of code that doesn't</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.690" end="00:05:01.640">include assets that doesn't include comments that doesn't include anything except for code?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:01.640" end="00:05:06.130">And, that's a lot it's worth mentioning that word is not a fifty</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.130" end="00:05:12.220">five million line application this includes publisher includes project</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12.220" end="00:05:16.970">includes outlook includes web apps includes a ton of stuff...really</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.970" end="00:05:22.980">and a broad...of applications and tools.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.980" end="00:05:27.300">And, most other platform versions have been forks in the past so this</p>
      <p begin="00:05:27.300" end="00:05:30.830">hundred-seventy one million lines does not include like the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:30.830" end="00:05:35.310">...version does not include the ios version does not include diversions we've put</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.310" end="00:05:39.850">out on the other mobile platforms in the past we've.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:39.850" end="00:05:49.120">Had successor releases on those platforms but we've done it by forking code.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:49.120" end="00:05:50.920">This used to be okay</p>
      <p begin="00:05:50.920" end="00:05:55.590">...over time the business has changed so when you look at the office business</p>
      <p begin="00:05:55.590" end="00:06:00.180">we originally we sold office to machines and you would get your box of office and you would have your twenty-one</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.180" end="00:06:04.070">disks or whatever it was and you'd have to hours bonding time with your machine where you switch those</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.070" end="00:06:08.950">...around and maybe...a bunch of machines but that's not really the way</p>
      <p begin="00:06:08.950" end="00:06:13.900">that things are done anymore now some of the single machine installs have gotten admittedly better since that</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.900" end="00:06:18.680">day but increasingly were selling to people.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.680" end="00:06:23.070">And, this means a couple different things this has a some very important</p>
      <p begin="00:06:23.070" end="00:06:28.560">ramming ramifications for us saatchi use the term portability of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:34.710">experience in the keynote... it's a great phrase and it's one that really resonates with us as well the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:34.710" end="00:06:39.450">experience of office if we're selling to you if you're buying office...sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:39.450" end="00:06:44.610">a contract between us and you that we're going to try to get office wherever you are if you're using a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:44.610" end="00:06:49.510">mobile device it should be on your mobile device if you're on a web page you should be able to access or documents on</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.510" end="00:06:54.510">a web page if you're on the rich client if you're on your laptop...you have a different way of accessing</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.510" end="00:06:59.610">...you have classic caps if...amac have ways of accessing wherever you are if</p>
      <p begin="00:06:59.610" end="00:07:03.300">your customer office we should be able to reach you and those</p>
      <p begin="00:07:03.300" end="00:07:07.980">...experiences should be consistent across those</p>
      <p begin="00:07:07.980" end="00:07:11.580">platformsit should feel like office, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:11.580" end="00:07:15.670">and, it's a fine-line it should also feel like the application or platform</p>
      <p begin="00:07:15.670" end="00:07:20.140">it's on but fundamentally people shouldn't have to figure out how to learn</p>
      <p begin="00:07:20.140" end="00:07:25.410">...again it should be consistent experience and we roll-out</p>
      <p begin="00:07:25.410" end="00:07:30.190">new features like we want to innovate we want to continue to innovate in the classic desktop we want</p>
      <p begin="00:07:30.190" end="00:07:34.380">to innovate mobile but when we add those new features they need to be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:34.380" end="00:07:39.570">be deployed to other platforms quickly we can't finish it on one platform</p>
      <p begin="00:07:39.570" end="00:07:42.960">forking over have another team somewhere ago and modify it and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:49.680">releases six months nine months a year later that just can't work anymore in the current business.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.680" end="00:07:55.490">So, going back to the what do we care about if we don't care about easy for mobile</p>
      <p begin="00:07:55.490" end="00:07:58.950">and in particular for these universal applications we care about</p>
      <p begin="00:07:58.950" end="00:08:02.800">change in the adjectives we want people to think of it differently, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:05.510">we really want to build that sports par luxury sports</p>
      <p begin="00:08:05.510" end="00:08:10.230">...or whatever we want fast and fun and it's not fun at least a pleasure to</p>
      <p begin="00:08:10.230" end="00:08:15.180">use so, you know, creating your presentation or your document may not be fun but,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:15.180" end="00:08:20.230">it can be a pleasure the apps themselves can feel-good can feel light can feel like they have</p>
      <p begin="00:08:20.230" end="00:08:23.250">our but that our doesn't get your way.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:23.250" end="00:08:25.700">We also care about sharing code.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:25.700" end="00:08:30.470">We really need to make sure we're not doing this for...were not duplicating efforts because if we want to</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30.470" end="00:08:33.950">role things out we have to have a shared code base we still need to</p>
      <p begin="00:08:33.950" end="00:08:38.350">relieve room for differentiation on platforms you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:38.350" end="00:08:43.740">people who are and platform expect certain things...platformyou've heard a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:08:43.740" end="00:08:48.610">about the new features on the windows platform and there's some really cool stuff on that</p>
      <p begin="00:08:48.610" end="00:08:53.650">and we need to leave room that we can extend the apps on those platforms take advantage of</p>
      <p begin="00:08:53.650" end="00:08:58.890">those great platform specific features and we do care about development speed</p>
      <p begin="00:08:58.890" end="00:09:04.900">it it's not quite true that we don't care about easy but we have a lot of developers and,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:04.900" end="00:09:09.870">if we can build complex and somewhat dubious solutions</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.870" end="00:09:14.850">essentially and then roll them out to other people will do that if we can build something</p>
      <p begin="00:09:14.850" end="00:09:17.430">...expensive once and,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:17.430" end="00:09:25.350">it saves us time or has a better experience we'll make that tradeoff every single time?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:25.350" end="00:09:30.280">looking at how we actually use the platform we started these applications in the eight-point</p>
      <p begin="00:09:30.280" end="00:09:33.970">one timeframe and in that time frame this is</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.970" end="00:09:38.850">...threshold or...windows term sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.850" end="00:09:43.410">The central question was we're going to build demo applications and how do we use</p>
      <p begin="00:09:43.410" end="00:09:48.780">those applications as fast as possible it's very hard to retrofit performance</p>
      <p begin="00:09:48.780" end="00:09:53.910">if you're building app it's much easier to get everything right from the start so</p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.910" end="00:09:58.620">the question became how do we use animal as fast as possible?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:58.620" end="00:10:03.870">So, the first...we came to was traditional data mining was just way too slow ...hopefully you saw the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:03.870" end="00:10:08.940">x...presentation if you...developer use exponent transition to</p>
      <p begin="00:10:08.940" end="00:10:12.730">x find if...app code...structured in such a way that camp support</p>
      <p begin="00:10:12.730" end="00:10:17.440">...changer app code so can use...if you still can't do that</p>
      <p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:24.590">use code behind it is a dramatic performance boost to...that...</p>
      <p begin="00:10:24.590" end="00:10:29.550">And, you will talk about how we solve that we probably would have a solution based on</p>
      <p begin="00:10:29.550" end="00:10:33.820">x...now if it had been available but,</p>

      <p begin="00:13:41.870" end="00:13:46.070">...code behind because a lot of that could behind it ends up being fairly repetitive</p>
      <p begin="00:13:47.270" end="00:13:51.520">it's basically the same code of...of again, yeah,</p>

      <p begin="00:14:03.370" end="00:14:08.470">we came up with was a custom solution based on bunch custom mock-up</p>
      <p begin="00:14:08.470" end="00:14:13.320">and as annual files that we call that example scripting.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:13.320" end="00:14:19.740">And, basically what we do is we preprocess as...files doing bill.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:19.740" end="00:14:24.220">So,...customer cup and as...files defines three basic things.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:24.220" end="00:14:27.560">Defines a set of properties that we're going to expose from a control.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:28.670" end="00:14:32.630">...it defines some scripts which are really small</p>
      <p begin="00:14:32.630" end="00:14:37.400">segments of code behind...will actually do the work to push that data</p>
      <p begin="00:14:37.400" end="00:14:45.880">into is elements...the...also defines when we want...scripts...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:45.880" end="00:14:50.780">And, then from this mock-up we generate...of the code behind that...the sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:14:50.780" end="00:14:55.540">...of code behind that you have to do by hand if you're...it.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:55.540" end="00:14:56.150">And, this is very</p>
      <p begin="00:14:56.150" end="00:15:01.450">...to what the valentin did with...we of showed them...solution and,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:01.450" end="00:15:09.090">...feedback...an insights on on-base what we did to help them influence that design.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:09.090" end="00:15:11.410">So, this is a quick glimpse of what some of</p>
      <p begin="00:15:11.410" end="00:15:16.570">...looks like which really doesn't make a whole lot like newsml.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:16.570" end="00:15:19.680">So, here where defining a property was saying this control</p>
      <p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:26.890">as a property of technical and that's a cool user.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:26.890" end="00:15:29.900">And, this script basically says.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:29.900" end="00:15:34.560">I take the name from the user I'm going to set into text of this text and that</p>
      <p begin="00:15:34.560" end="00:15:39.560">will just become code behind the standard cx code in the code behind.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:39.560" end="00:15:43.820">And, lasting it defines is a trigger says when we want that</p>
      <p begin="00:15:43.820" end="00:15:51.350">scripts to one...usa...it's going to go when the name of that user changes.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:51.350" end="00:15:56.070">So, affiliated if you look at this script is really doing is basically the same</p>
      <p begin="00:15:56.070" end="00:15:58.880">...bind allows you to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:58.880" end="00:16:02.200">It's a little less...looking but,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:02.200" end="00:16:08.280">we were working outside of the platform sources this is what we came up with.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:08.280" end="00:16:13.080">Swivel this out to the whole office old that was working on family life.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:13.080" end="00:16:17.740">And, it really performed what...work quite well but the main</p>
      <p begin="00:16:17.740" end="00:16:22.360">...of the...getting thing was to avoid using data binding and to get</p>
      <p begin="00:16:22.360" end="00:16:27.330">...performance gains of not using data binding using code by instead.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:27.330" end="00:16:32.240">And, this should be similar to what you see if you switzer text by and I think when we</p>
      <p begin="00:16:32.240" end="00:16:37.190">...count the votes is one of the more example heavy you office applications</p>

      <p begin="00:16:41.950" end="00:16:48.500">we made the...fifty-cent faster so it does make a big difference.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:48.500" end="00:16:51.700">there were some other effects of this crazy scripting solution.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:52.800" end="00:16:56.750">One thing is when the designing it we really wanted it to be a</p>
      <p begin="00:16:56.750" end="00:17:00.740">...data mining especially for pushing data into is eml</p>
      <p begin="00:17:00.740" end="00:17:05.410">butts we're allowing people to write ui...and that code in</p>

      <p begin="00:17:08.910" end="00:17:13.740">...file it became convenient place for people to stop adding logic and</p>
      <p begin="00:17:13.740" end="00:17:17.300">...overtime more and more code...added to</p>

      <p begin="00:22:00.260" end="00:22:05.380">it does work great as a...interop layer it really allows you to not have marsh</p>
      <p begin="00:22:05.380" end="00:22:08.470">ling cost and use correctly it's really great?</p>
      <p begin="00:22:08.470" end="00:22:13.290">So, to understand this I'm going to do a sort of side-by-side so on the left I have cx</p>
      <p begin="00:22:13.290" end="00:22:14.390">class this is</p>
      <p begin="00:22:14.390" end="00:22:18.750">href class this corresponds to a windows runtime object on the right</p>
      <p begin="00:22:18.750" end="00:22:23.520">as a cplus-plus representation of the class and this uses something called wr</p>
      <p begin="00:22:23.520" end="00:22:28.770">...I'm not sure whether you're familiar with this or not the stands for windows runtime library and it's</p>
      <p begin="00:22:28.770" end="00:22:34.500">in the sdk all of the things I mention here...the public sdk they are not</p>
      <p begin="00:22:34.500" end="00:22:40.650">super documented but we're going through the same code baths that you can go through as well so</p>
      <p begin="00:22:40.650" end="00:22:44.720">...class over here it has a public session section.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:48.090">So, I have a property and a method in this section and,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:48.090" end="00:22:51.240">what cplus-plus eecs is going to do is it's going to build and interface</p>
      <p begin="00:22:51.240" end="00:22:55.690">...so if you look on the right-hand side that I through public non virtual xyz</p>
      <p begin="00:22:55.690" end="00:23:01.560">a generated interface that contains those methods it turns the property into a</p>
      <p begin="00:23:01.560" end="00:23:03.680">...and setter function and,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:03.680" end="00:23:07.240">it translates them into...results because the actual interfaces are use</p>
      <p begin="00:23:07.240" end="00:23:12.610">...results cx will wrap things and exceptions for you it makes it kind of nice easy-to-use</p>
      <p begin="00:23:12.610" end="00:23:19.940">but the actual underlie intact is old-school com style interop?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:19.940" end="00:23:21.030">If you inherit from</p>
      <p begin="00:23:21.030" end="00:23:25.880">...interface it works in an exact same way it's just overrides all of</p>
      <p begin="00:23:25.880" end="00:23:30.600">...stuff so far is in the actual published version of the object so it's accessible</p>
      <p begin="00:23:30.600" end="00:23:36.550">avp from csharp...accepts accessible from outside your binary.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:36.550" end="00:23:38.440">There's another kind of scoping</p>
      <p begin="00:23:38.440" end="00:23:43.010">are called internal and csharp developers may be familiar with this may be new</p>
      <p begin="00:23:43.010" end="00:23:47.300">to cplus-plus developers and internal actually corresponds</p>
      <p begin="00:23:47.300" end="00:23:52.260">to the public section of the cplus-plus class but not the published</p>
      <p begin="00:23:52.260" end="00:23:56.030">...section so this is not</p>
      <p begin="00:23:56.030" end="00:24:00.190">available to csharp is not available outside the binary but if you</p>
      <p begin="00:24:00.190" end="00:24:04.570">were inside the binary you can just call these as public functions so I have a native type</p>
      <p begin="00:24:04.570" end="00:24:10.180">in here there's a little bit of a typo between the two but the point is you can have any kind of data typing</p>
      <p begin="00:24:10.180" end="00:24:16.680">passed through...as members on these functions finally private works just like private.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:16.680" end="00:24:23.100">when you're writing code inside cplus-plus...makes example easy here's...code take a control</p>
      <p begin="00:24:23.100" end="00:24:27.690">...the render transforms x coordinate two-twenty five?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:27.690" end="00:24:29.550">Pretty simple but.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:29.550" end="00:24:34.460">It turns into the following code you have to query over from control ty element and you</p>
      <p begin="00:24:34.460" end="00:24:36.830">call get render transform this gets...the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:36.830" end="00:24:42.410">...transform actually sometimes create the object but they will cassette for you return the type back you'll</p>
      <p begin="00:24:42.410" end="00:24:45.530">...address release...on that and you qi again to translate</p>
      <p begin="00:24:45.530" end="00:24:48.730">transform and then finally even call put eczema translate transform</p>
      <p begin="00:24:48.730" end="00:24:53.090">now that sounds like a lot it's actually not all that bad in</p>
      <p begin="00:24:53.090" end="00:24:57.710">isolation the problem comes when you write the following code.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:57.710" end="00:25:02.520">Now there's sort of a contracts and virtual interfaces and in</p>
      <p begin="00:25:02.520" end="00:25:06.070">...interfaces where people can do crazy stuff like tear</p>
      <p begin="00:25:06.070" end="00:25:11.660">offs like every time you call query interface you could return a different interface if you want no</p>
      <p begin="00:25:11.660" end="00:25:16.010">one does but because you could the platform can't optimize these</p>
      <p begin="00:25:16.010" end="00:25:21.370">lines so every one of these lines will actually repeat all of those lines above</p>
      <p begin="00:25:21.370" end="00:25:26.150">and if you're using this for if in most cases this is not a problem but if you're using this</p>
      <p begin="00:25:26.150" end="00:25:31.470">and high-frequency code list items are common case of high-frequency code so if you</p>
      <p begin="00:25:31.470" end="00:25:37.590">write this code without thinking about it can actually become a performance a significant part of your</p>
      <p begin="00:25:37.590" end="00:25:43.860">performance.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:43.860" end="00:25:49.500">when using cplus-plus types and, as I said for us one of the big questions how to integrate</p>
      <p begin="00:25:49.500" end="00:25:55.130">our legacy types in most cases you can use am pretty easily from once you</p>
      <p begin="00:25:55.130" end="00:25:59.160">get the types they just you can use them like you can and cplus-plus</p>
      <p begin="00:26:00.580" end="00:26:05.700">...the question is how to get those into the object in the first-place in the same</p>
      <p begin="00:26:05.700" end="00:26:10.250">binary use that internal scoping...a...it's easy but, across</p>
      <p begin="00:26:10.250" end="00:26:15.580">...it gets a little bit harder we've we had a couple different patterns we used for this</p>
      <p begin="00:26:15.580" end="00:26:18.100">...patterns you can look up the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:18.100" end="00:26:23.670">pattern so that you can actually reinterpret cast between object and I</p>
      <p begin="00:26:23.670" end="00:26:29.320">and spectral star and do some fancy stuff there really the one we found that work the best it's a</p>
      <p begin="00:26:29.320" end="00:26:34.600">...feels like a little bit of a hack but soviet was actually just</p>
      <p begin="00:26:34.600" end="00:26:37.980">...methods you can...method that takes a href class</p>
      <p begin="00:26:37.980" end="00:26:42.950">amac a model and because the function executes on the inside of the binary it can call</p>
      <p begin="00:26:42.950" end="00:26:48.260">those internal function so some of our scripting stuff actually generates</p>
      <p begin="00:26:48.260" end="00:26:55.670">setter functions that allow you to set things...binary into it?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:55.670" end="00:27:00.410">one of the more frustrating to me at least limitations...eecs</p>
      <p begin="00:27:00.410" end="00:27:04.440">is you can't inherit from native types so if you actually want to</p>
      <p begin="00:27:04.440" end="00:27:08.980">expose your cplus-plus classes to x bind you need to find some way to</p>
      <p begin="00:27:08.980" end="00:27:13.570">wrap them so, the most common way to do this is to put in a</p>
      <p begin="00:27:13.570" end="00:27:16.500">...class around them using cx and,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:16.500" end="00:27:20.520">then you embed the classroom side so I have a sample uniform simple class here has</p>
      <p begin="00:27:20.520" end="00:27:26.490">a property change notification and gets a string so.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:26.490" end="00:27:31.920">Rapping with cx is pretty straightforward if a bit wordy you take your base property notify</p>
      <p begin="00:27:31.920" end="00:27:37.210">change or not...changed implementation and you basically forward things through</p>
      <p begin="00:27:37.210" end="00:27:42.130">and, the should be relatively straightforward to everyone here.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42.130" end="00:27:46.070">If you actually want to use...cplus-plus inheritance if you want</p>
      <p begin="00:27:46.070" end="00:27:50.810">...cplus-plus eecs it turns out you can do it it's a little bit tricky</p>
      <p begin="00:27:50.810" end="00:27:55.070">and very non obvious and the way to do it is found in a way</p>
      <p begin="00:27:55.070" end="00:28:00.070">that the platform sdk itself is generated if you look in the sdk you'll</p>
      <p begin="00:28:00.070" end="00:28:05.880">see that there for windows dot you why...dot ideal there's an</p>
      <p begin="00:28:05.880" end="00:28:09.180">...file there's about age file and...associated with</p>
      <p begin="00:28:09.180" end="00:28:14.010">...the files and what happens is if you build-up an ideal file and,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:14.010" end="00:28:18.970">I have some example code here you create a runtime class and some interfaces you can run</p>
      <p begin="00:28:18.970" end="00:28:23.120">it through middle at with the...rt flag...will spit out a header and</p>
      <p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:29.740">when md file for you if they're can only really bone when I'm deeper binary if</p>
      <p begin="00:28:29.740" end="00:28:34.670">it's a separate binary you can just use that if you want emerged...there's a tool called</p>
      <p begin="00:28:34.670" end="00:28:40.540">md emerge from this may involve some custom-built steps it's a little tricky but</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.540" end="00:28:45.410">it is possible and then once you set this up you can use the wr</p>
      <p begin="00:28:45.410" end="00:28:50.270">all which I mentioned before hand to actually implement this so</p>
      <p begin="00:28:50.270" end="00:28:53.370">from this you can actually compose it with your native types you</p>
      <p begin="00:28:53.370" end="00:28:57.960">can compose it with anything you can mix and classic com you can mix in other</p>
      <p begin="00:28:57.960" end="00:29:01.430">I am spectacles it's really gives you the full our</p>
      <p begin="00:29:01.430" end="00:29:06.400">of cplus-plus now you don't necessarily want to do this for everything but</p>
      <p begin="00:29:06.400" end="00:29:11.150">it's something you can do if you really have performance intensive code and this avoids</p>
      <p begin="00:29:11.150" end="00:29:19.370">having multiple objects...you can have a single object exposed?</p>
      <p begin="00:29:19.370" end="00:29:23.020">Right so I'm going to switch gears and get back to them a little</p>
      <p begin="00:29:24.100" end="00:29:29.320">so, in office we have we have a lot of existing resource pipelinesyou know,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:29.320" end="00:29:33.070">we have a...tables...huge amounts of images</p>
      <p begin="00:29:33.070" end="00:29:38.100">we've invested a lot of time and money in these in these resource pipelines</p>
      <p begin="00:29:38.100" end="00:29:40.520">easy...pipelines what designed</p>

      <p begin="00:29:51.210" end="00:29:55.710">Example has a custom resource loader that allows you to basically a provide</p>
      <p begin="00:29:55.710" end="00:30:00.580">interfaces...say when you need to loading resource tell me which resource some</p>
      <p begin="00:30:00.580" end="00:30:04.430">slowed and I'll give it to allows you to integrate</p>

      <p begin="00:30:11.310" end="00:30:14.050">...example file and give you...</p>
      <p begin="00:30:14.050" end="00:30:16.420">Which is great but most of our resource</p>
      <p begin="00:30:16.420" end="00:30:20.550">pipelines the index space that's a little more efficient generate look things up</p>
      <p begin="00:30:20.550" end="00:30:26.330">by index and then string maps so to avoid doing is extra-strength look up at</p>

      <p begin="00:37:50.890" end="00:37:55.610">And, to do that I'm going to show you autotest application that we have here which is</p>
      <p begin="00:37:55.610" end="00:38:00.490">an application where we actually requirements of...developers when writing control.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:00.490" end="00:38:06.730">Toattest page in this application...test that control in isolation manually</p>
      <p begin="00:38:06.730" end="00:38:13.910">play with it ...we have some integration attest system to...testing its control...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:13.910" end="00:38:17.780">So, in this page we have a little control panel the playing with</p>
      <p begin="00:38:17.780" end="00:38:22.610">...panel which handles...animations for us.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:22.610" end="00:38:29.620">So, I'm going to hit is I messiah changing layout of the objects in this panel.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:29.620" end="00:38:32.370">You'll see the that the object animate...you positions.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:39.990">Now I'm doing is just changing the layout this panel and everything's smoothie animated...new positions.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:39.990" end="00:38:45.780">And, I can I can customize animations so I can I can slow them down a little</p>
      <p begin="00:38:45.780" end="00:38:50.330">...dynamics one other thing on point out here.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50.330" end="00:38:50.890">Is the as I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50.890" end="00:38:55.650">...layout while they're still automating very smooth smoothly moving from</p>
      <p begin="00:38:55.650" end="00:39:02.080">the current position while the animated to the new target that especially moving to?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:02.080" end="00:39:06.850">And, I'll just show one-click other example...of this.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:06.850" end="00:39:10.210">Who have a bunch because I'm going to add a whole pile more control</p>
      <p begin="00:39:10.210" end="00:39:14.460">...panel now smoothie anyway and except this</p>
      <p begin="00:39:14.460" end="00:39:18.410">...seems to be a little slower?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:18.410" end="00:39:21.150">And, I can change the size of these guys and they</p>
      <p begin="00:39:21.150" end="00:39:31.160">will also smoothly animate any size and use new position...same time.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:31.160" end="00:39:33.100">So, this custom panel</p>
      <p begin="00:39:34.320" end="00:39:38.940">niggers the flexibility storyboards we can use...the customizations even</p>
      <p begin="00:39:38.940" end="00:39:44.960">do storyboards and also actually integrates the existing animations we have</p>
      <p begin="00:39:44.960" end="00:39:47.320">...for desktop.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:47.320" end="00:39:49.290">We shed definitions cost.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:49.290" end="00:39:55.840">...to platforms so we can have...have a similar field...office experience.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:55.840" end="00:40:03.600">And, we automatically trigger them on reposition...hide that's how it's implemented.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:03.600" end="00:40:07.290">First thing we do is we add a couple properties to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:07.290" end="00:40:10.010">...panel ones animation class defines.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:11.280" end="00:40:17.330">Which...by animation definitions which we using...elements within this panel?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.330" end="00:40:21.920">We also have an attached to the propertywhich is a great way is</p>
      <p begin="00:40:21.920" end="00:40:24.350">...extend the platform?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:24.350" end="00:40:29.150">We use that to specify individual elements within...panel that...maybe use a</p>
      <p begin="00:40:29.150" end="00:40:36.160">different set animations that's why...element was going...had a different animation class adamant.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:36.160" end="00:40:40.330">...center measurement ranges usual but then join</p>
      <p begin="00:40:40.330" end="00:40:47.480">a range will dynamically create storyboards on-the-fly to animate what changed.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:47.480" end="00:40:51.800">So, here's a little segment of what...range might look like.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:51.800" end="00:40:53.680">The beginning...</p>
      <p begin="00:40:53.680" end="00:40:59.080">Manger child...to...aboard.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:59.080" end="00:41:01.950">And, we animatevendor transform.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:01.950" end="00:41:04.830">Calculate where the element used to be animate</p>
      <p begin="00:41:04.830" end="00:41:08.240">format position two-two-zero twenty it'll be it'll be showing</p>
      <p begin="00:41:08.240" end="00:41:13.970">...final position...we just desktop that animation.</p>

      <p begin="00:41:16.960" end="00:41:20.570">what happens if the position changes...is...</p>
      <p begin="00:41:21.770" end="00:41:26.180">Take a closer look at this ...old position that's where the</p>
      <p begin="00:41:26.180" end="00:41:29.740">element was going to...if we use this code here well,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:29.740" end="00:41:33.730">actually if the position change that we're going from a to be a</p>
      <p begin="00:41:33.730" end="00:41:39.250">...say accuracy will immediately snappy to be if you this code here so</p>
      <p begin="00:41:39.250" end="00:41:44.340">the solution is actually it's not...difficult but it's completely not obvious.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:44.340" end="00:41:46.940">We actually always...earlier.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:46.940" end="00:41:51.860">We do the entire layout using vendor transform only and then when</p>
      <p begin="00:41:51.860" end="00:41:56.750">...creating a storyboards we only need to specify the final location weary specify</p>
      <p begin="00:41:56.750" end="00:42:02.580">...going to and we can leave the farm expression off entirely on the</p>
      <p begin="00:42:02.580" end="00:42:07.200">And,...in that case if they'll pick up the...value even if it's in the middle of</p>

      <p begin="00:42:15.540" end="00:42:21.030">The other thing up analyses is resize animations this is a question that I see come</p>
      <p begin="00:42:21.030" end="00:42:27.010">...internally places and externally...come up all-time.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:27.010" end="00:42:32.690">And, zone nearly support resize animations generally what people</p>
      <p begin="00:42:32.690" end="00:42:37.430">those is they start out by to animate...property or height property</p>
      <p begin="00:42:37.430" end="00:42:42.820">...sample kinda yell at you and...and...animation.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:42.820" end="00:42:47.640">And, what that really means is that animation is going to running like that it's not going to run on</p>
      <p begin="00:42:47.640" end="00:42:51.990">...composite so while animation may look</p>
      <p begin="00:42:51.990" end="00:42:55.830">or some of them develop...box when you put that on some low</p>

      <p begin="00:44:00.820" end="00:44:04.910">So, I'm going to close out the presentation by talking about where we are today</p>
      <p begin="00:44:05.980" end="00:44:09.330">we're currently getting ready to ship these applications</p>
      <p begin="00:44:09.330" end="00:44:13.650">are not quite done yet but they include word excel powerpoint one note</p>
      <p begin="00:44:13.650" end="00:44:18.600">and new mail-in calendar applications one...is of course been in the store for some time</p>
      <p begin="00:44:18.600" end="00:44:24.010">and if...the new builds of windows ten you should be able to get them from the store so please download them</p>
      <p begin="00:44:24.010" end="00:44:28.200">try them out submit feedback submit reviews</p>
      <p begin="00:44:28.200" end="00:44:30.370">...love to get feedback on these things</p>
      <p begin="00:44:31.770" end="00:44:36.680">it's worth noting that these are completely built on the public platform the way we use</p>
      <p begin="00:44:36.680" end="00:44:41.630">them on those applications the things we do our all public we don't have any back doors</p>
      <p begin="00:44:41.630" end="00:44:45.810">or inside type of negotiations with salmon</p>
      <p begin="00:44:45.810" end="00:44:50.230">it's all public so it's all possible for-you to do whether it's advisable</p>
      <p begin="00:44:50.230" end="00:44:54.840">a or little crazy is another question but.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:54.840" end="00:44:59.760">And, the windows ten improvements are big deal to us you heard a lot of great things this</p>
      <p begin="00:44:59.760" end="00:45:04.620">during this conference about new performance improvements and those will help us as well we're very excited</p>
      <p begin="00:45:04.620" end="00:45:10.090">about them are working to integrate them as fast as we can so, over the next couple months</p>
      <p begin="00:45:10.090" end="00:45:15.260">we expect the office applications will get even better as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:15.260" end="00:45:19.570">...we invented...data binding replacement but I'm going to promote x</p>
      <p begin="00:45:19.570" end="00:45:23.800">...one more time if it...existed then we would...used it we</p>
      <p begin="00:45:23.800" end="00:45:26.910">...we're generating models now we would have generated interop</p>
      <p begin="00:45:26.910" end="00:45:29.310">...fry and spectacle rather than generating</p>
      <p begin="00:45:30.420" end="00:45:37.560">complex templates that do sort of compile-time type systems.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:37.560" end="00:45:41.440">It's also they're also truly universal apps and this was</p>
      <p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:44.710">a philosophy we had or sort-of...approach we had</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.710" end="00:45:49.380">...from the get-go we knew we wanted to do this we knew we wanted to be dynamic we</p>
      <p begin="00:45:49.380" end="00:45:51.460">...one package for mobile and for</p>
      <p begin="00:45:51.460" end="00:45:56.310">desktop we wanted to adapt to changes on-the-fly you know, it's important</p>
      <p begin="00:45:56.310" end="00:46:03.180">us that we can ...note have to you don't have to reboot the application you know, the I...</p>
      <p begin="00:46:03.180" end="00:46:08.280">you guys saw a or hopefully saw the continuum for phones and that's something that's really exciting for us so</p>
      <p begin="00:46:08.280" end="00:46:11.610">applications will be able to shift from a phone centric</p>
      <p begin="00:46:11.610" end="00:46:17.710">...to a truly desktop centric qi dynamically.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:17.710" end="00:46:19.210">As a philosophical</p>
      <p begin="00:46:19.210" end="00:46:23.420">...we wanted to use consistent crossover points this is similar to all of our</p>
      <p begin="00:46:23.420" end="00:46:28.910">...animal we have a philosophy that developer should never hard code anything</p>
      <p begin="00:46:28.910" end="00:46:32.760">whatever because it makes it very hard to change it when you inevitably need</p>
      <p begin="00:46:32.760" end="00:46:36.160">...so it's really important that you don't have one app</p>
      <p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:40.970">changing six eighty and one app changing at seven hundred and getting...so,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:40.970" end="00:46:44.770">you establish your points assume you're going to change things assume you're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:46:44.770" end="00:46:50.010">changer colors assume you're going to change everything and set...to make it easy to do and,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:50.010" end="00:46:53.430">then in terms of building you why we had a lot of sort of layering principles</p>
      <p begin="00:46:54.570" end="00:46:59.480">...pictures I pulled up here are the same build same version of the application</p>
      <p begin="00:46:59.480" end="00:47:02.830">this is word and, you see the right-hand side is what we call the</p>
      <p begin="00:47:02.830" end="00:47:07.050">...ui which is the phone version of the ribbon it comes up from the bottom</p>
      <p begin="00:47:07.050" end="00:47:12.890">on the left is the standard ribbon you would see on desktop of universal ...</p>
      <p begin="00:47:12.890" end="00:47:17.760">those are the same controls and...and those controls inside don't really know</p>
      <p begin="00:47:17.760" end="00:47:22.970">whether living they don't care they just those controls know-how to how to render you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:22.970" end="00:47:25.820">keeping these principles of you have elements that are loaded</p>
      <p begin="00:47:25.820" end="00:47:31.120">from data the way you do that is relatively the same but you can change the layout middle so,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:31.120" end="00:47:34.420">effectively abstracted effectively and,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:34.420" end="00:47:40.520">make sure that you can dynamically swap those layouts.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:40.520" end="00:47:45.090">And, lastlycode sharing...is a big one for us and universal</p>
      <p begin="00:47:45.090" end="00:47:50.710">as built out of our main tree it's not based on a fork this is the first-time we really were</p>
      <p begin="00:47:50.710" end="00:47:57.070">doing a mobile release out of this code tree it's the same tree that produces</p>
      <p begin="00:47:57.070" end="00:48:00.740">when thirty-two same...produces the web applications and,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:00.740" end="00:48:03.570">actually if you guys followed android the android tablet version</p>
      <p begin="00:48:03.570" end="00:48:08.170">that was released recently is out of the same tree as well and,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:08.170" end="00:48:13.100">the universal applications are sort of a new shared code base for</p>
      <p begin="00:48:13.100" end="00:48:19.080">officer for at least mobile office and android is built out of that same code base so when we look at</p>
      <p begin="00:48:19.080" end="00:48:23.260">the code sharing...this these stats...here are from</p>
      <p begin="00:48:23.260" end="00:48:26.560">a powerpoint but when we look at code sharing between them</p>
      <p begin="00:48:26.560" end="00:48:31.890">were at about ninety six percent shared and universal and, that includes...when you excludes</p>
      <p begin="00:48:31.890" end="00:48:36.710">animal we're at about ninety eight-point six submit a little bit there are platform light up</p>
      <p begin="00:48:36.710" end="00:48:38.660">some things like thatwhen you look</p>
      <p begin="00:48:38.660" end="00:48:43.210">android it's ninety five percent shared with ninety nine point seven so almost</p>
      <p begin="00:48:43.210" end="00:48:49.350">hundred-percent code sharing between android and universal when you exclude</p>
      <p begin="00:48:49.350" end="00:48:50.450">...the job...</p>
      <p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:55.750">So, this is something we're really thrilled about and something that we want to</p>
      <p begin="00:48:55.750" end="00:48:59.790">extend and continued to grow and develop and bring the other applications</p>
      <p begin="00:48:59.790" end="00:49:03.470">...versions we've done into the fold.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:03.470" end="00:49:05.020">So,...that I'm going to refer you to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:05.020" end="00:49:11.220">a couple sessions that were done earlier more work closing out the show here but,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:11.220" end="00:49:16.250">the data binding talk and this...performance talk really have a lot of great information and them</p>
      <p begin="00:49:16.250" end="00:49:23.250">if you didn't attend those go watch them I also referenced here a presentation.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:23.250" end="00:49:28.820">My boss actually gave had the at scale conference and,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:28.820" end="00:49:34.130">it's worth looking at its the office approach to cross platform you...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:34.130" end="00:49:38.760">cplus-plus app building and it's actually...focused more just</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38.760" end="00:49:45.990">cross platform coding so it's worth...look as well and, with that evaluate the session and we're going to use the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:45.990" end="00:49:50.220">rest the time for any questions you have we don't we don't have I don't think the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:50.220" end="00:49:54.320">when site windows insider lounges going to be available because the build this</p>
      <p begin="00:49:54.320" end="00:49:57.260">...but, we'll be here as long as</p>
      <p begin="00:49:57.260" end="00:50:10.610">have questions so if you have questions for us just come up to the microphones and thank you.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:10.610" end="00:50:15.760">Just a question you see the cplus-plus layer as a net positive or negative...if</p>
      <p begin="00:50:15.760" end="00:50:20.740">...from scratch today would you still have a cplus-plus layer.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:20.740" end="00:50:27.790">As a common layer console your platforms I think we would it, you know.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:27.790" end="00:50:32.710">There is no perfect or one-size-fits-all solution when you look at the size of</p>
      <p begin="00:50:32.710" end="00:50:39.070">office it's impossible to get the amount of things we do into?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:39.070" end="00:50:44.320">fitting a huge amount of features and functionality encode into a very narrow surface you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:44.320" end="00:50:49.550">it I talked about the fast bus and desktop considering it's,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:49.550" end="00:50:51.490">you know, millions and millions of lines of code it</p>
      <p begin="00:50:51.490" end="00:50:57.810">actually runs really fast and it's really the our of native code that allows that to happen and,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:57.810" end="00:51:02.050">a lot of the manner solutions are really great but we're sharing</p>
      <p begin="00:51:02.050" end="00:51:07.150">that code base with the desktop client and cplus-plus is one of the few languages</p>
      <p begin="00:51:07.150" end="00:51:11.570">lets us do that and, I also think it's worth mentioning that if</p>
      <p begin="00:51:11.570" end="00:51:18.740">...me five years ago how excited I was about cplus-plus you know, it be like well, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:18.740" end="00:51:21.190">it's really fast but,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:21.190" end="00:51:26.450">it's actually evolved a lot as a language the cplus-plus eleven ...</p>
      <p begin="00:51:26.450" end="00:51:29.720">the extensions that have been done or not extensions but support for that</p>
      <p begin="00:51:29.720" end="00:51:34.120">in visual studio are great and something that we've really</p>
      <p begin="00:51:34.120" end="00:51:39.020">...and people...excited about embracing so I think it's a one you absolutely</p>
      <p begin="00:51:39.020" end="00:51:43.840">need to use has little our get as much performance users little battery</p>
      <p begin="00:51:43.840" end="00:51:49.140">as possible it's toss the best solution and it works, you know, you can have a</p>
      <p begin="00:51:49.140" end="00:51:55.680">core that works across android ios when thirty-two?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:55.680" end="00:51:59.370">Whatever platform you might be on and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:59.370" end="00:52:02.630">we want to have that core we...unit test that...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:02.630" end="00:52:10.540">then we want to...sort of front-ends that work different ways.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:10.540" end="00:52:13.150">I was able to make to do data binding one-button</p>
      <p begin="00:52:13.150" end="00:52:19.590">act spine that you mentioned is that something is available to wpf words just for universal</p>
      <p begin="00:52:19.590" end="00:52:21.280">I think it is just for universal</p>
      <p begin="00:52:21.280" end="00:52:35.410">...is something that is I think just those...code base so?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:35.410" end="00:52:37.110">Ok, well.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:37.110" end="00:52:41.190">Thank you all and we will be around here if you have any...thanks.</p>
