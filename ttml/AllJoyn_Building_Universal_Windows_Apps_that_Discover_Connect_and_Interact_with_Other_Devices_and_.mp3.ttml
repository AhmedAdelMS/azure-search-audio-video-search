      <p begin="00:00:11.320" end="00:00:16.230">...rockwell and we both work on the team in windows that's working on all join</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.230" end="00:00:19.550">and working with the all seen alliance work</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.550" end="00:00:23.800">sided today to talk to-you about the work that we've been doing with the all seen alliance in</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.800" end="00:00:29.800">with our partners just a brief note at the end you're going to have an opportunity to send</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.800" end="00:00:34.660">...your feedback I'll put the secure code up again at the and we would really</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.660" end="00:00:41.750">appreciate...if you take the time to submit and evaluation and give us your feedback.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.750" end="00:00:46.230">So, about five years ago I set out on a mission a mission that I thought would</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.230" end="00:00:51.070">be fairly straightforward I wanted to build home entertainment system.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.070" end="00:00:54.250">That would use a single remote.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.250" end="00:00:55.860">That would be cost-effective</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.860" end="00:01:00.650">didn't want to spend as much on a remote control as I would on an xbox.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.650" end="00:01:05.180">It would also be easy to setup easy to maintain...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.180" end="00:01:10.030">easy-to-use and being the obsessive person that I am I set out</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.030" end="00:01:14.620">into a binge of analysis paralysis I...just about every</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.620" end="00:01:19.660">component on the market and in the end I got close to my goal</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.660" end="00:01:23.920">...xbox three sixty remote control I used to surround sound system and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:26.950">a tv from panasonic that both used</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.950" end="00:01:31.940">...the error link to communicate with each other and life overall was good I couldn't our down the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:31.940" end="00:01:36.590">surround sound system and I did have to switch inputs on the remote control and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:36.590" end="00:01:42.970">...gavin I'm not nearly as obsessive as you are ignores proposal but I looked into this same as you</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.970" end="00:01:47.940">about the same time but I quickly backed away from it just seemed.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:47.940" end="00:01:51.690">It's complicated it's expensive...jumbled up...the technology</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.690" end="00:01:56.490">generally seem to be there it seems like a little bit of ways of opportunity well I also</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.490" end="00:02:01.440">have kind of devolved into the basket of remote scenario I decided I</p>
      <p begin="00:02:01.440" end="00:02:06.200">was going to try and amazon fire tv which of course uses bluetooth and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:06.200" end="00:02:11.300">then I've got everything else on infrared and in frustration I</p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.300" end="00:02:15.060">thought to myself how could it be twenty fifteen, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.060" end="00:02:19.520">this day and age when we put a man on the moon with connected the whole world with</p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.520" end="00:02:24.520">the internet we're just on the verge of being able to three-d print replacement</p>
      <p begin="00:02:24.520" end="00:02:31.010">body parts it still takes me three remote controls to watch tv.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.010" end="00:02:35.510">Now there's just so much potential all the scenarios of interoperability and all these</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.510" end="00:02:38.160">devices working together at this area is just exploding.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.210" end="00:02:42.870">...so many new devices being created each day</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.870" end="00:02:46.010">the opportunity is definitely profound the id...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.010" end="00:02:50.750">is predicting in the next five years we're going to have...billion</p>
      <p begin="00:02:50.750" end="00:02:56.430">connected devices that's for connected devices for every man woman and child on the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.430" end="00:03:01.200">face of the earth but where there's huge opportunities</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:05.630">there's also huge challenges this example here is just, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.630" end="00:03:10.690">the end result of some of those challenges what we're here today to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:10.690" end="00:03:14.950">talk about is all scene and all join this is a technology</p>
      <p begin="00:03:14.950" end="00:03:18.970">that was created to address some of these huge challenges</p>
      <p begin="00:03:18.970" end="00:03:22.130">and to help remove some of these huge barriers</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.130" end="00:03:26.320">being developers we want to give you guys and you all.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.320" end="00:03:31.160">A sort of all join one-on-one so that you can understand what all join is what the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:31.160" end="00:03:36.830">different platform components are how they work and then how you can actually bring them</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.830" end="00:03:41.690">into windows so we've spent some time in the past year bringing all join into windows one</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.690" end="00:03:46.630">at explore some of the reasons why we did this some of the benefits of this gives us as well</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.630" end="00:03:50.990">as get you guys...you can go out and make the next great internet of things</p>
      <p begin="00:03:50.990" end="00:03:54.140">app will tell you how to get involved with the alston</p>
      <p begin="00:03:54.140" end="00:04:01.010">alliance move forward potentially contribute you could back and helped drive the future of io t?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:01.010" end="00:04:04.780">So,...in general we're going to talk about quick question</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.780" end="00:04:09.910">who here has heard of the all seen alliance and knows with all sequences while.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.910" end="00:04:14.090">...impressive so also alliances basically the organization,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14.090" end="00:04:18.600">organization that is a consortium of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.600" end="00:04:21.700">hundreds of companies that have come together to help</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21.700" end="00:04:26.490">evolve the future of the internet of things it's run by the linux foundation</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.490" end="00:04:31.490">uses some of the people on the resources and the structure from the linux foundation but really all</p>
      <p begin="00:04:31.490" end="00:04:36.360">seen alliance is the organization all join is the result of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:36.360" end="00:04:41.000">the collaboration between these companies it's actually the code base and the source?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.000" end="00:04:44.480">Is open-source and crops platform any developer can use</p>
      <p begin="00:04:44.480" end="00:04:51.140">it to enabled their apps and the devices to be internet connected?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.140" end="00:04:55.690">So, the example that I gave of my home entertainment system was really</p>
      <p begin="00:04:55.690" end="00:04:59.600">just a small view into a much larger problem domain the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:01.320">problem domain of the smart connected</p>
      <p begin="00:05:01.320" end="00:05:05.870">home the technology to connect these different vices has already existed</p>
      <p begin="00:05:05.870" end="00:05:11.300">for many years but a lot of them are trapped withinconcrete verticals in their</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.300" end="00:05:14.740">...it's either within and I or</p>
      <p begin="00:05:14.740" end="00:05:20.060">...os within the manufactures schema.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:20.060" end="00:05:23.490">But, they're all...down-and-out hard to act.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23.490" end="00:05:28.440">And, viewing this from app developers perspective there's really a lot of surface area, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:28.440" end="00:05:31.740">you've got different protocols different api...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31.740" end="00:05:36.170">a lot of different scenarios to provide support for your application</p>
      <p begin="00:05:36.170" end="00:05:40.820">...and it's a moving target you never know when another...release</p>
      <p begin="00:05:40.820" end="00:05:47.680">new protocol another way to integrate that sort of thing and in order for these</p>
      <p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:52.410">scenarios to become mainstream these problems half to get addressed we've got</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52.410" end="00:05:56.790">to make it easier for app developers to provide</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56.790" end="00:06:01.410">ubiquitous support for this new internet of things</p>
      <p begin="00:06:01.410" end="00:06:06.850">of this whole world of devices that's going to proliferate.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:06.850" end="00:06:11.000">In all join actually it was created without...mind all drawing</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.000" end="00:06:15.750">provides the necessary means for devices to</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.750" end="00:06:20.380">exposes standard interfaces it provides applications</p>
      <p begin="00:06:20.380" end="00:06:24.340">standardize means for being able to discover connects</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24.340" end="00:06:29.770">to control these devices so...join supports the platforms that all</p>
      <p begin="00:06:29.770" end="00:06:34.680">it operates on it's on the most popular consumer resources it's on all of the most</p>
      <p begin="00:06:34.680" end="00:06:40.650">popular manufacture os is for making imbedded devices it doesn't matter where you write your</p>
      <p begin="00:06:40.650" end="00:06:45.210">...can be ios android or windows and it doesn't matter what system it's</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.210" end="00:06:50.190">return on rather...to for small devices or it's imbedded...all these can</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.190" end="00:06:54.950">interop...open it's the promise that we're trying to create.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.950" end="00:06:57.710">...removing these platform specific obstacles</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57.710" end="00:07:00.870">as a great but I think one of the most valuable things about all</p>
      <p begin="00:07:00.870" end="00:07:06.030">seen in all join is the set of standardized interfaces that are</p>
      <p begin="00:07:06.030" end="00:07:09.280">defined within various working groups the fact you can</p>
      <p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:14.080">define your own device interfaces it provides a devices with</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:18.170">a common language to express the functionality that the implement</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.170" end="00:07:22.310">and provides applications a standardized way</p>
      <p begin="00:07:22.310" end="00:07:27.720">to discover different classes of devices and to interact with an as well</p>
      <p begin="00:07:27.720" end="00:07:32.280">and this example let's say you wanted to build a smart connected</p>
      <p begin="00:07:32.280" end="00:07:37.180">smoke detector this smoke detector would just sit around and wait for...</p>
      <p begin="00:07:37.180" end="00:07:42.080">to be detected it's going to raise a notification basically</p>
      <p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:43.250">your houses on fire.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44.280" end="00:07:48.900">And, it might have a feedback mechanism this smoke detector might also,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:48.900" end="00:07:53.780">you know, provide interface if you're cooking in the kitchen you have some smoke maybe want to provide a</p>
      <p begin="00:07:53.780" end="00:07:58.430">temporary silence for that alarm right so this is a great example</p>
      <p begin="00:07:58.430" end="00:07:59.000">internet</p>
      <p begin="00:07:59.000" end="00:08:03.700">...device that all join would be furthered for because this was able to expose the device</p>
      <p begin="00:08:03.700" end="00:08:08.730">metadata it's able to have on board white-white you can update the...you</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08.730" end="00:08:15.280">can send notifications and...itself to be controlled by some type of consumer...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:20.180">So, using the smoke detectors and example, you know, it's just a part of a really broad.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:20.180" end="00:08:24.100">Spectrum of hardware that makes up the internet of things everything</p>
      <p begin="00:08:24.100" end="00:08:29.010">from really low-power battery-powered resource constrain microcontroller</p>
      <p begin="00:08:29.010" end="00:08:33.860">sensors all the way up to servers in a datacenter and the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:33.860" end="00:08:38.540">all join platform was implemented with this broad spectrum of io</p>
      <p begin="00:08:38.540" end="00:08:42.770">t hardware in mind so going back to the smoke detector example where</p>
      <p begin="00:08:42.770" end="00:08:46.780">there's a couple different ways that we can implement the device itself we could</p>
      <p begin="00:08:46.780" end="00:08:49.870">implemented as sort of an...which could be,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.870" end="00:08:53.260">you know, hardware battery-powered microcontroller</p>
      <p begin="00:08:53.260" end="00:08:55.560">base platform or it could be a little bit more</p>
      <p begin="00:08:55.560" end="00:08:58.940">...the smoke detector could not</p>
      <p begin="00:08:58.940" end="00:09:03.850">...subtype functionality were other edge devices could connect to it and that kind</p>
      <p begin="00:09:03.850" end="00:09:08.620">of right and for resource constraint devices the all...alliance offers the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.620" end="00:09:13.290">thin...of all...this is really good for micro...has a very small</p>
      <p begin="00:09:13.290" end="00:09:17.990">who'd size and has a...language that can work on anything that supports</p>
      <p begin="00:09:17.990" end="00:09:22.960">ongoing which is almost anything you more robust devices your hubs or you consumer apps we</p>
      <p begin="00:09:22.960" end="00:09:28.100">have the standard for this is based on cplus-plus it also has a see offering for</p>
      <p begin="00:09:28.100" end="00:09:33.490">...and...has a specific offerings then on top of that you have you...you</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.490" end="00:09:38.220">why in logic embedded into device or the controller app?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.220" end="00:09:42.520">And, you can go from there so you'll see there's a little uw p box will</p>
      <p begin="00:09:42.520" end="00:09:47.520">...back to that later the universal windows platform part of this is really cool.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:47.520" end="00:09:51.840">So, that's the that's the core functionality that's about connecting it's about advertising</p>
      <p begin="00:09:51.840" end="00:09:55.500">its about discovering it's about controlling kind of all</p>
      <p begin="00:09:55.500" end="00:10:00.790">doing basics but on top of that all doing provides a set of what are called</p>
      <p begin="00:10:00.790" end="00:10:05.750">common service frameworks these common service frameworks implement a lot of the code</p>
      <p begin="00:10:05.750" end="00:10:09.800">that a lot of I each fees would typically right for their devices</p>
      <p begin="00:10:09.800" end="00:10:14.600">or isv would typically have to write for their apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:14.600" end="00:10:16.810">Common device interaction functionality</p>
      <p begin="00:10:17.910" end="00:10:22.020">...talked about our smoke detector and how it's likely to want to</p>
      <p begin="00:10:22.020" end="00:10:27.270">expose device metadata it's likely to want to advertise which interfaces</p>
      <p begin="00:10:27.270" end="00:10:29.560">...functionality implements</p>
      <p begin="00:10:29.560" end="00:10:34.190">all join provides the about interface for this functionality</p>

      <p begin="00:29:47.510" end="00:29:52.240">You can even create your own device it's very simple all devices are</p>
      <p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:56.880">defined...based on the interfaces you can quickly...up your own you can use</p>
      <p begin="00:29:56.880" end="00:30:01.330">are windows ten tools to generate code from it because.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:01.330" end="00:30:04.900">That just makes it easy and then you hook up at all...and functionality your</p>
      <p begin="00:30:04.900" end="00:30:08.940">...combine the logic and then you can build it you can deploy</p>

      <p begin="00:30:23.830" end="00:30:27.840">...universal windows app is going to look something like this there's really two</p>
      <p begin="00:30:27.840" end="00:30:32.720">categories of code that you're concerned with the code that you can be using and the code that you can be</p>
      <p begin="00:30:32.720" end="00:30:36.540">writing so below the magenta box we have all the code that we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:30:36.540" end="00:30:41.030">...using and...foundation we have inbox and all</p>
      <p begin="00:30:41.030" end="00:30:45.220">joins see standard core api this is the api that</p>
      <p begin="00:30:45.220" end="00:30:49.740">provides the functionality for your device or your app to be able to</p>

      <p begin="00:30:53.990" end="00:30:58.870">it basically implements all the functionality that's required for connectivity</p>
      <p begin="00:30:58.870" end="00:31:03.260">so the foundation of all join on top of that we've built</p>
      <p begin="00:31:03.260" end="00:31:07.740">a proper universal windows platform api so it's</p>
      <p begin="00:31:07.740" end="00:31:11.950">got all of the type mappings in implements the patterns that you're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:31:11.950" end="00:31:16.370">be familiar with writing universal windows applications so</p>
      <p begin="00:31:16.370" end="00:31:21.270">this means that you can either have more low-level granular control if you need it which</p>
      <p begin="00:31:21.270" end="00:31:26.770">you probably want or you can use our native up api for this core all</p>
      <p begin="00:31:26.770" end="00:31:30.790">join functionality to perform all of the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:30.790" end="00:31:36.750">fundamental all join tasks and activities then you have generated code you have</p>

      <p begin="00:31:52.280" end="00:31:57.200">...for-you the only time you actually need to change it is if you modify the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:57.200" end="00:32:01.930">interfaces and definitions of your device in that case you just need to regenerate code</p>
      <p begin="00:32:01.930" end="00:32:07.130">it's once again available for you and then you actually use this code in</p>

      <p begin="00:32:35.140" end="00:32:38.610">...alliance you can even get just from a producer running on</p>
      <p begin="00:32:38.610" end="00:32:42.720">your network so all these devices their announcing</p>

      <p begin="00:34:39.720" end="00:34:45.060">and it's just another way that we've been able to optimize performance.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:45.060" end="00:34:48.560">So, all joined is an extension of the</p>

      <p begin="00:34:52.420" end="00:34:56.980">story and because of that you can write your code once.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:56.980" end="00:35:00.480">You can optimally supplied different layout example</p>
      <p begin="00:35:00.480" end="00:35:05.110">or html for different screen sizes are different form factors and</p>
      <p begin="00:35:05.110" end="00:35:08.910">then target these multiple devices we actually did this that will help we</p>
      <p begin="00:35:08.910" end="00:35:11.570">had a hands-on lab or we had a lighting control</p>
      <p begin="00:35:11.570" end="00:35:16.780">out we had the same exact code that we deployed to...max running windows</p>
      <p begin="00:35:16.780" end="00:35:21.140">ten-ninety for devices and ran locally on the pc is really,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:21.140" end="00:35:24.370">really easy and it's a really great benefit for</p>
      <p begin="00:35:24.370" end="00:35:28.050">developers and once again this is all the promises that</p>
      <p begin="00:35:28.050" end="00:35:31.060">...made earlier it's.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:31.060" end="00:35:31.780">You want</p>
      <p begin="00:35:31.780" end="00:35:36.180">...something that deploys evert you can have you want to write something that tailored specifically to</p>
      <p begin="00:35:36.180" end="00:35:45.600">a device your open able to do it...actually show that process, yeah, let's do it.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:45.600" end="00:35:50.550">...one of the things we mentioned is that you can actually get the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:50.550" end="00:35:55.510">xml and the device datafrom the produces directly on...networks so why don't</p>
      <p begin="00:35:55.510" end="00:36:00.060">we go ahead and make a toaster controller...doesn't.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:00.060" end="00:36:04.010">So, we have a tool that we're going to be shipping that</p>
      <p begin="00:36:04.010" end="00:36:08.290">allows us to listen to the different devices on the network so we go that</p>
      <p begin="00:36:08.290" end="00:36:14.410">and there's a lot there so I'm going to exit out that I'm just going to say this so file.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:14.410" end="00:36:20.340">again, this is some of the detail you won't even have to worry about when visual studio twenty fifteen windows</p>
      <p begin="00:36:20.340" end="00:36:22.230">ten ships or building it into</p>

      <p begin="00:36:26.190" end="00:36:30.600">So, I can go ahead and looked at my devices that I have here.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:30.600" end="00:36:37.160">I can see that I have...my...on your...app I have.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:37.160" end="00:36:38.260">Quite a bit of...</p>
      <p begin="00:36:38.260" end="00:36:44.700">apps apparently I have my combine demo that we showed we have our life explodes.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:44.700" end="00:36:48.230">We have our...tv.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:48.230" end="00:36:57.610">...I see the toaster in there.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:57.610" end="00:37:11.660">What you search on toast and I'm going to make sure testers actually running?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.660" end="00:37:12.980">Ok.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:12.980" end="00:37:31.240">So, let's see okay we're up and running sorry about that.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:31.240" end="00:37:36.200">The great thing is we can basically take any of these devices that we have running on the network and</p>
      <p begin="00:37:36.200" end="00:37:40.170">...the moment we're going to show you how you can use this get ag xml tool to</p>
      <p begin="00:37:40.170" end="00:37:43.950">...introspection maximal for each of the interfaces here that are</p>
      <p begin="00:37:43.950" end="00:37:48.080">shown with their corresponding object paths also...yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:48.080" end="00:37:51.270">so, here we have it that's an interesting model number that we have</p>
      <p begin="00:37:51.270" end="00:37:58.460">...that that's actually my birthday that's funny so you can see this...</p>
      <p begin="00:37:58.460" end="00:38:03.410">It finds the...name which is the unique name that the...has on the bus with the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:03.410" end="00:38:08.150">port and...the object path so we can take this information and we can put into</p>
      <p begin="00:38:08.150" end="00:38:09.550">our tool.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09.550" end="00:38:14.720">As arguments.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:14.720" end="00:38:23.030">then we get the actual interface information once again we're just going to stick this into a file.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:23.030" end="00:38:26.280">Here we get interfaces that we explicitly implement</p>
      <p begin="00:38:26.280" end="00:38:30.950">and we also get interfaces that are in the implicitly</p>
      <p begin="00:38:30.950" end="00:38:35.860">implemented our behalf so we have some extra stuff here so I'm going to get rid of that extra</p>
      <p begin="00:38:35.860" end="00:38:40.180">stuff for now because we don't actually need it for what we want to do with our toaster</p>
      <p begin="00:38:40.180" end="00:38:45.140">okay so we're using the toaster interface that's what we have here so we defined our interface</p>
      <p begin="00:38:45.140" end="00:38:50.330">as a sample in the microsoft domain we have the methods which is</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50.330" end="00:38:55.250">how it consumer interfaces with a producer or initiates like</p>
      <p begin="00:38:55.250" end="00:39:00.560">...pc...like obviously we have two of those we have...thing you have a signal that</p>
      <p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:04.720">...status from the toasters done this is how a producer generally</p>
      <p begin="00:39:04.720" end="00:39:07.530">wall initiate contact with the consumer</p>
      <p begin="00:39:07.530" end="00:39:10.650">and then we have a property darkness which is a un that</p>
      <p begin="00:39:10.650" end="00:39:17.470">is rewrite accessible this is stored on the producer and can be accessed by the consumer?</p>

      <p begin="00:39:22.990" end="00:39:28.830">May cause your house burned down so ...go ahead and run the all join code general</p>
      <p begin="00:39:28.830" end="00:39:34.610">...input the toaster xml will put these and.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:34.610" end="00:39:41.360">Our cogent file core and as you can see it's pretty quick.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.360" end="00:39:47.080">Or files are right here everything that you need to get up and running.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:47.080" end="00:39:51.360">So, conceptually we...this talking about the common service frameworks and how</p>
      <p begin="00:39:51.360" end="00:39:56.240">they provide higher-level functionality the code generator essentially gives us</p>
      <p begin="00:39:56.240" end="00:40:00.740">something analogous to a common service framework but something that we can have</p>
      <p begin="00:40:00.740" end="00:40:03.870">is universal windows platform component use a directly from</p>
      <p begin="00:40:03.870" end="00:40:13.780">around right so I'm going-to go ahead and make myself a toaster consumer project?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:13.780" end="00:40:18.410">Hopefully with this app we can and the whole phenomenon of cold...because you</p>

      <p begin="00:40:25.740" end="00:40:29.680">...given mentioned we generally take care of this for-you with</p>
      <p begin="00:40:29.680" end="00:40:34.260">...visual studio extension integration but in the meantime I'm going-to go ahead and</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.260" end="00:40:40.670">add-in all the code that we had from.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:40.670" end="00:40:44.650">The code generation...of all in this run-time.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:44.650" end="00:40:47.130">And, I'll just pop that in their...</p>
      <p begin="00:40:47.130" end="00:40:52.130">steps required here for the build that you guys are going to be working with again we're going to have the blog postal</p>

      <p begin="00:40:57.310" end="00:41:00.840">So, the very first thing when you have your</p>
      <p begin="00:41:00.840" end="00:41:04.680">...or the first thing we have to do at least until integration is we're going</p>
      <p begin="00:41:04.680" end="00:41:12.370">to have to add the all join capability and this capability lets you.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:12.370" end="00:41:16.060">Tell your users essentially what capabilities</p>
      <p begin="00:41:16.060" end="00:41:22.480">layer app has its sets firewall settings it takes a lot of communication for you.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:24.260">What I go ahead and adam reference?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:25.710" end="00:41:28.930">To the to runtime that we added.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:28.930" end="00:41:34.280">And, then let's go ahead and just try and build.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:34.280" end="00:41:44.360">...given...code builds.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:44.360" end="00:41:48.970">So, this is basically where we've got all of our boiler plate code taking care of and</p>
      <p begin="00:41:48.970" end="00:41:52.990">we're ready at this point hopefully to start writing our olds running code</p>
      <p begin="00:41:52.990" end="00:41:57.260">...that actually uses the altering functionality.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:57.260" end="00:41:59.300">So, I'm going to good use the tool-box.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:00.690" end="00:42:05.390">To go ahead and add some buttons that we will use to stardom</p>
      <p begin="00:42:05.390" end="00:42:12.450">stopper toasting...engineers were not designers so please behind.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:12.450" end="00:42:16.480">That's the...use myself a slider.</p>

      <p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:28.610">And, then I'm going to clean this up a little bit.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:28.610" end="00:42:30.330">Renaming are</p>
      <p begin="00:42:30.330" end="00:42:39.400">...variables I like the code will read quite a bit cleaner.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:39.400" end="00:42:41.610">And, again, we could use this ui right here that</p>

      <p begin="00:45:24.630" end="00:45:36.590">are consumer and we can go ahead and...the signals bill and I'm.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:36.590" end="00:45:44.690">So, we go ahead and register for this signals one-at-a-time and this is once again really</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.690" end="00:45:48.990">Plus equals tab.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:48.990" end="00:45:54.390">Think them...generators...there...</p>
      <p begin="00:45:54.390" end="00:45:59.540">in this we can do whatever we want solet's go ahead.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:59.540" end="00:46:03.840">And,...when we have a toast like this...actions and</p>
      <p begin="00:46:03.840" end="00:46:09.020">that so we have a little bit of...squiggles visual studio makes it role you to get rid of those</p>
      <p begin="00:46:09.020" end="00:46:14.000">...add the using statements and for us.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:19.760">And, that's signature right there so, when we join that session the very first thing...want to do is initialize</p>
      <p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:25.080">...variables so let me go ahead and creative darkness</p>
      <p begin="00:46:26.500" end="00:46:29.370">A thing of course.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:29.370" end="00:46:34.110">Is love how brand centralize is code?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:34.110" end="00:46:34.640">So, we're</p>
      <p begin="00:46:34.640" end="00:46:39.590">going-to go ahead and take our toaster consumer and we're going to call the very</p>
      <p begin="00:46:39.590" end="00:46:46.820">pardon method set darkness a...pass...darkness you want.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:46.820" end="00:46:53.170">That's all it's going to take to actually do that course after type correctly.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:53.170" end="00:46:57.970">And, then synthesis asynchronous we have to awaited.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:57.970" end="00:47:02.640">So, that's most of the things taken care of now we just have to go ahead and implement what happened</p>
      <p begin="00:47:02.640" end="00:47:03.790">...the darkness</p>
      <p begin="00:47:03.790" end="00:47:14.130">...changes so we'll go ahead and take...darkness and wall...you want.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:14.130" end="00:47:31.380">And, then once again...have to change these to asynchronous methods.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:31.380" end="00:47:35.040">...a part of that generated code provides us a very</p>
      <p begin="00:47:35.040" end="00:47:39.150">easy to use a up interface that pretty</p>
      <p begin="00:47:39.150" end="00:47:43.140">much maps identically to introspection xml but,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:43.140" end="00:47:45.930">with udp semantics</p>
      <p begin="00:47:45.930" end="00:47:51.850">goal now we have everything there let's go ahead and run and we should.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:51.850" end="00:47:57.670">Get ourselves some toast nice.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:57.670" end="00:48:03.480">So, you...good and set that to I think we might have lost our toaster</p>
      <p begin="00:48:03.480" end="00:48:13.910">...toasters acting up today.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:13.910" end="00:48:28.090">Just kick the toaster.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:28.090" end="00:48:32.350">gay if we get that we get artist on we can go ahead and see that</p>
      <p begin="00:48:32.350" end="00:48:36.750">...center along with all the other notifications of...clear that</p>
      <p begin="00:48:36.750" end="00:48:41.220">...so that it really is quite simple and not a lot of...all</p>
      <p begin="00:48:41.220" end="00:48:45.400">...write a windows...using ongoing.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:45.400" end="00:48:50.270">So, the code that were going to ...to from the session page for this session</p>
      <p begin="00:48:50.270" end="00:48:55.410">will actually also include a basic implementation of a toaster producer</p>
      <p begin="00:48:55.410" end="00:48:58.260">so would be cool would be to</p>
      <p begin="00:48:58.260" end="00:49:02.360">write a toaster producer implementation something like what</p>
      <p begin="00:49:02.360" end="00:49:10.760">we've shown here and again we'll have a link to that in our session page.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:10.760" end="00:49:14.300">So, earlier ...utopian picture the world</p>
      <p begin="00:49:14.300" end="00:49:18.530">...slide with all of the pink dots every app knows about alternatively</p>
      <p begin="00:49:18.530" end="00:49:23.450">every device implements all join functionality natively but we all know</p>
      <p begin="00:49:23.450" end="00:49:25.900">that's not reality there's always going to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:25.900" end="00:49:30.250">be a composite a different protocols are different implementations different api</p>
      <p begin="00:49:30.250" end="00:49:35.570">is the good news is microsoft has been working on...has contributed back to the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:35.570" end="00:49:40.240">...will also alliance something called the devices system ridge this</p>
      <p begin="00:49:40.240" end="00:49:44.990">device system bridge makes it really easy to taking non all join devices</p>
      <p begin="00:49:44.990" end="00:49:48.520">...wave and back net devices and to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:48.520" end="00:49:54.770">expose these devices as virtual...devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:54.770" end="00:49:59.680">There's two key benefits here one is the older interoperability story if</p>
      <p begin="00:49:59.680" end="00:50:04.550">you already adding all join support interior jpf for windows ten</p>
      <p begin="00:50:04.550" end="00:50:09.260">you're going to be able to discover in interact with the devices that are</p>
      <p begin="00:50:09.260" end="00:50:10.810">exposed through this dsp.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:12.180" end="00:50:15.090">One of the other key benefits is the fact that we can</p>
      <p begin="00:50:15.090" end="00:50:20.070">enhance security if we have devices that are inherently less secure we can add</p>
      <p begin="00:50:20.070" end="00:50:24.410">layers of security on top of the virtual all join</p>
      <p begin="00:50:24.410" end="00:50:29.270">devices that are exposed off the dsp so if we need credential exchange</p>
      <p begin="00:50:29.270" end="00:50:33.870">or encrypted data traffic that makes it very easy to do that now</p>
      <p begin="00:50:33.870" end="00:50:37.140">...richardson is going to be giving a talk here</p>
      <p begin="00:50:37.140" end="00:50:42.460">...the very last session on friday if you want to know more about the dsp and io</p>
      <p begin="00:50:42.460" end="00:50:47.350">t stuff I would encourage you to check out her talk.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:47.350" end="00:50:52.780">So, as...announced...coming out with our app in their hub</p>
      <p begin="00:50:52.780" end="00:50:57.770">...right now you have a visual...integration that will have available</p>
      <p begin="00:50:57.770" end="00:51:02.480">soon and we have more all join samples coming we talked about the different</p>
      <p begin="00:51:02.480" end="00:51:06.730">common service frameworks will have a sample that shows you how to...device as</p>
      <p begin="00:51:06.730" end="00:51:11.610">well as sample or how you receive notifications then we also have existing samples that we</p>
      <p begin="00:51:11.610" end="00:51:16.310">have that show how to create a producer and consumer how to create signals</p>
      <p begin="00:51:16.310" end="00:51:22.580">methods and properties and how to implement security so we've had a lot of fun working on all</p>
      <p begin="00:51:22.580" end="00:51:27.540">...getting your hands dirty with all join we want invite all you to do the same and</p>
      <p begin="00:51:27.540" end="00:51:32.300">what you can do today is install windows ten you can build</p>
      <p begin="00:51:32.300" end="00:51:35.400">all join enabled up devices and apps and, you know, the</p>
      <p begin="00:51:35.400" end="00:51:40.390">code that we're going to from the session pages a great way to get started with that but we would really love to</p>
      <p begin="00:51:40.390" end="00:51:45.470">hear your feedback because we want to know what the developer experiences</p>
      <p begin="00:51:45.470" end="00:51:50.420">like what did you like what did you like what was missing was great whether...involve the awesome</p>
      <p begin="00:51:50.420" end="00:51:55.340">alliance with mentioned...open anyone conjoined there's several different working groups</p>
      <p begin="00:51:55.340" end="00:52:00.150">that you can help to...and define the future of different workspace is whether</p>
      <p begin="00:52:00.150" end="00:52:05.350">...appliances...be winding whether if it's just a common service frameworks it's open</p>
      <p begin="00:52:05.350" end="00:52:09.300">...contributor code back and you can help define the shape forward</p>
      <p begin="00:52:09.300" end="00:52:13.680">especially in relation to device schemas and introspection xml for different classes</p>
      <p begin="00:52:13.680" end="00:52:18.640">of devices absolutely with that we'd like to open up the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:18.640" end="00:52:22.790">floor for questions we actually have a couple microphones here if anyone has questions</p>
      <p begin="00:52:22.790" end="00:52:27.700">you-can file your way to the aisles come forward and?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:27.700" end="00:52:38.100">We'll handle those questions now.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:38.100" end="00:52:44.170">You implementing the data-driven api as well as the other</p>
      <p begin="00:52:44.170" end="00:52:48.480">Can you elaborate on the question was are we implementing data-driven api as well as the other</p>
      <p begin="00:52:48.480" end="00:52:51.940">...for you have the...subscribe api set</p>
      <p begin="00:52:51.940" end="00:52:54.000">...go beyond just your?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:52:59.670">Your arming events for normal</p>
      <p begin="00:52:59.670" end="00:53:05.560">data streams up so we have everything that's available with windows ten I don't think audio</p>
      <p begin="00:53:05.560" end="00:53:08.170">...as anything specifically around data-driven api,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:09.390" end="00:53:14.740">yeah, it's basically the producer and consumer semantics that we talked about</p>
      <p begin="00:53:14.740" end="00:53:18.780">and any of the interactions that we described with.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:18.780" end="00:53:21.260">Our pc method calls being able to set</p>
      <p begin="00:53:21.260" end="00:53:25.910">properties you can actually get notifications on those changes and then signals and</p>
      <p begin="00:53:25.910" end="00:53:30.790">the notification framework which the toaster actually implement support for is one of those</p>
      <p begin="00:53:30.790" end="00:53:38.850">common service frameworks that sits on top of signals essentially.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:38.850" end="00:53:43.130">Reply dot net or something else this code here</p>
      <p begin="00:53:43.130" end="00:53:48.080">is running imbedded linux and this is the standard core out running on</p>
      <p begin="00:53:48.080" end="00:53:53.510">embedded linux there's alsothin core version that I also implemented but,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:53.510" end="00:53:56.520">you can develop similar device</p>
      <p begin="00:53:56.520" end="00:54:09.280">implementations using windows ten ot for small devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:09.280" end="00:54:15.530">Activation happens automatically...</p>
      <p begin="00:54:16.820" end="00:54:31.220">Any other questions.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:31.220" end="00:54:40.560">John you have to know about that...fix lc m engine.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:05.190" end="00:55:08.700">I can get that for-you afterwards reveling link to it</p>
      <p begin="00:55:08.700" end="00:55:14.420">...point this is a great transition.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:14.420" end="00:55:21.940">So, these are just a few the sessions that are going to be relevant.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:21.940" end="00:55:25.860">So, the concurrently to rightnow was ...have...here</p>
      <p begin="00:55:25.860" end="00:55:32.250">dsp one just to go back to that was seven...that...might not be able to tell from the title.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:32.250" end="00:55:37.450">...the process reveling to yes six</p>
      <p begin="00:55:37.450" end="00:55:43.950">...that's actually happening right now...have to view that one online.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:43.950" end="00:55:47.720">But, our friends and microsoft up attacker giving overview of the all the</p>
      <p begin="00:55:47.720" end="00:55:52.060">...work that we're doing which all during...part of also...the largest</p>
      <p begin="00:55:52.060" end="00:55:57.110">...open-source software currently in windows but we're basically paving the way to bring more</p>
      <p begin="00:55:57.110" end="00:56:00.400">am very interested about different open-source code</p>
      <p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:06.700">bases joining windows ten go look at that top happy with your.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:06.700" end="00:56:11.360">As we mentioned at the beginning to talk...you can take a moment to give us your feedback on</p>
      <p begin="00:56:11.360" end="00:56:16.250">the session that would be awesome and...and I will be available for just a couple minutes down here in the</p>
      <p begin="00:56:16.250" end="00:56:20.620">front...korea of windows insider section of course...so come</p>
      <p begin="00:56:20.620" end="00:56:25.540">around the corner and talk percent if you have more and then so, drew over there is</p>
