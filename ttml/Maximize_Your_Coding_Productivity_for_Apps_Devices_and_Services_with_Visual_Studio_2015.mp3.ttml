      <p begin="00:00:00.280" end="00:00:05.290">So, my name is mark wilson thomas and I'm a program manager on the visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:00:05.290" end="00:00:10.370">id team I look off...visual studio editor but I'm part of the team that looks after all of</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.370" end="00:00:15.710">the core infrastructure that all the experiences inside visual studio live on so,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.710" end="00:00:16.800">my piece about the edit</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.800" end="00:00:22.480">...you'll see several other pieces that we'll talk about today so I want to be the I think probably the seventh</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.480" end="00:00:27.370">person to welcome you to san francisco and to build...after the cams in the...xi</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.370" end="00:00:35.630">...enjoy them I'm hoping that ...justify the fact that I'm currently standing between you and your lunch.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.630" end="00:00:39.920">By being here today to talk about the some great stuff that the team that</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.920" end="00:00:42.860">...parts of has been working on to make your experience</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.860" end="00:00:47.000">...studio twenty fifteen better app.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.000" end="00:00:49.260">So, they made me put this slide in</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.260" end="00:00:54.950">early I just really want to emphasize that it's great to get your feedback and,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.950" end="00:00:59.360">...valuations will really count and we do actually read every single one of them and</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.360" end="00:01:03.770">the tweak and untouched what we talk about as a result so what you say</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.770" end="00:01:07.010">mathis and upset?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.010" end="00:01:11.760">Is our agenda for today and, the next hour we're going to be spending some time</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:16.550">looking at the changes we've been making in visual studio two thousand fifteen?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.550" end="00:01:20.410">And, I'm going to be focusing particularly on things that we've done to help you</p>
      <p begin="00:01:20.410" end="00:01:24.220">find and fix errors in your code...vicks issues in your code</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.220" end="00:01:29.310">will cover a whole bunch of stuff as well that is around how we've done that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.310" end="00:01:34.260">in a way that is personalize to your needs and to the devices that you work</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.260" end="00:01:39.240">on and also takes into account the kinds of services that you have to work with in the world that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.240" end="00:01:45.560">you're building apps and today so let's get started with that?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.560" end="00:01:46.080">First up I</p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.080" end="00:01:50.650">...talk a little bit about the visual studio product family in</p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.650" end="00:01:55.480">two thousand fifteen so these are the new additions a visual studio that will be available in the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.480" end="00:02:00.020">twenty fifteen timeframe I'm sure some of you've probably seen all of this</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.020" end="00:02:04.510">before it's been available for quite some time and in fact actually there's a</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.510" end="00:02:08.210">...at the bottom that you can refer to get more details but</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.210" end="00:02:13.050">what I really want to emphasize here is that we've been simplifying the choices that you have to make when you</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.050" end="00:02:17.030">decide which visual studio addition to use so if you're working in a</p>
      <p begin="00:02:17.030" end="00:02:22.320">...enterprise environment and, you're looking for a free...to work with</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.320" end="00:02:26.400">...studio community is your answer okay and you probably all</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.400" end="00:02:31.970">a web justification all visual studio twenty fifteen community also supports extensions</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.970" end="00:02:37.180">so you can use all your favorite extensions from the via ecosystem with the product</p>
      <p begin="00:02:37.180" end="00:02:42.330">...so you're no longer stuck with not being able to do that which you needs to be able to do in the express</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.330" end="00:02:43.690">skews.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.690" end="00:02:49.230">We've simplified the full-page line-up of the professional an enterprise</p>
      <p begin="00:02:49.230" end="00:02:52.940">...only two-page additions if you want to see what the differences</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.940" end="00:02:57.860">between those are I really do suggest you hit up that link there because enumerating them here would be very</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.860" end="00:03:02.130">dull so, it's importantly understand that the your</p>
      <p begin="00:03:02.130" end="00:03:09.000">choices a simplified and you don't have to spend as much time scratching your head before you get started.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.000" end="00:03:13.690">Talking of getting started one of the ways in which we've made visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:03:13.690" end="00:03:18.780">set of us as a place that is much more customized to your needs and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:18.780" end="00:03:23.540">much more personalized your needs is we've started to really work on simplifying and customizing</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23.540" end="00:03:28.830">...okay what you'll see when you install the release candidate which you</p>
      <p begin="00:03:28.830" end="00:03:34.370">have access to today is a smaller default core set</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.370" end="00:03:39.660">of items...up...the default...visual studio working to make that</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.660" end="00:03:44.010">footprint smaller still and the idea there is if you don't work with sequel</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.010" end="00:03:48.510">server you don't work with cplus-plus you shouldn't have to pay the tax</p>
      <p begin="00:03:48.510" end="00:03:51.370">...installing that on your disk and maintaining</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.370" end="00:03:56.880">going forward which means that we should actually have a good impact both in terms of your</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.880" end="00:04:01.400">own disk footprint but also in terms of the experience that you get when you update visual</p>
      <p begin="00:04:01.400" end="00:04:06.450">studio as well so we don't have to take care of as many bits if you don't like them down in the first-place</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.450" end="00:04:10.690">what means is that there are more choices available say when you get to the optional</p>
      <p begin="00:04:10.690" end="00:04:15.430">dialog if you're not finding the thing that you need present when you install</p>
      <p begin="00:04:15.430" end="00:04:18.740">and ossie the story is that you would you need to go and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.740" end="00:04:23.860">...it through the optional features dialogue we are thinking about some other possibilities there and,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.860" end="00:04:28.150">we be interested...feedback of what kind of experience you might like for things that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.150" end="00:04:33.970">...installed out-of-the-box but what we're putting forth now is if you want to find and it's not</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33.970" end="00:04:37.200">instill by default...up the option options and,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.200" end="00:04:42.990">you can do this in a change scenario as well throughout remove programs</p>
      <p begin="00:04:42.990" end="00:04:49.770">we think it's better that you have a smaller cool long story short...supporting a whole lot</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.770" end="00:04:54.700">more platforms I think if you've been kind of staying awake in the connection I really have you have because I thought it</p>
      <p begin="00:04:54.700" end="00:04:59.420">was pretty exciting one you'll notice...supposing a whole lot more platforms after the box them</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.420" end="00:05:03.280">...we have in previous versions of visual studio...and by that I mean</p>
      <p begin="00:05:03.280" end="00:05:07.030">...a platforms that targeting so,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:07.030" end="00:05:12.240">notably for instance we are now supporting android out-of-the-box that is not a small piece</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12.240" end="00:05:16.970">of work and is actually something you don't want to opt into but those platforms</p>
      <p begin="00:05:18.170" end="00:05:21.970">...broadest than they've ever been in the past however,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.970" end="00:05:25.470">we still have kept our previous policy and kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:25.470" end="00:05:29.330">pattern of being side-by-side compatible with previous versions of visual</p>
      <p begin="00:05:29.330" end="00:05:34.650">studio so I want you guys to be afraid to go ahead and installed ossie ...are plenty</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.650" end="00:05:39.800">of caveats and comments on what you need to think about their but</p>
      <p begin="00:05:39.800" end="00:05:44.560">in broad terms we are side-by-side compatible and we do test for that scenarios so you should be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:44.560" end="00:05:49.760">stick this on your machine right alongside visual studio twenty thirteen for instance and have</p>
      <p begin="00:05:49.760" end="00:05:55.790">no problems trying it out that's an important scenario for us we...make sure that we get all of your feedback and we</p>
      <p begin="00:05:55.790" end="00:06:00.150">...that having to have a special machine is not necessarily the easiest way if</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.150" end="00:06:04.600">you to give that feedback there are other options if you're in an environment that's really not bound</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.600" end="00:06:09.510">all you have production machines...cautious in one way or another you can get hold of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.510" end="00:06:14.080">as a virtual machines to but please do hit up the release candidate links to get the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:17.780">full details on that but we are side-by-side compatible and as I alluded</p>
      <p begin="00:06:17.780" end="00:06:23.230">to earlier we are working very hard to factor visual studio in such a way in terms of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:23.230" end="00:06:29.320">...packaging to make sure that it is in units that can be updated more cleanly</p>
      <p begin="00:06:29.320" end="00:06:33.640">and, more quickly what that means is you should experience when we...the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:33.640" end="00:06:39.450">put out some new piece of tooling a lot of the time you're going to experience...much quicker update</p>
      <p begin="00:06:39.450" end="00:06:44.620">...much smaller download for those visual studio updates so that's just something to watch out for when we</p>
      <p begin="00:06:44.620" end="00:06:49.970">ship those first updates and as, you know, we're on this regular update cadence now and, that we hope</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.970" end="00:06:58.610">will make a big difference to...so you get a customized visual studio install experience?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.610" end="00:07:01.170">...personalization that making of your visual</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.170" end="00:07:05.190">studio also extends to what we do with your settings</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.190" end="00:07:10.190">and services and this is where I'm going to help into some demos but first off I want to ask a quick show of</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.190" end="00:07:15.420">hands how many of you ever sign in visual studio losing that little box...top</p>
      <p begin="00:07:15.420" end="00:07:17.650">...corner.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:17.650" end="00:07:22.330">Probably about half just on a quick squid...the lights a real bright and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:22.330" end="00:07:28.410">here but it it's not surprising to me that about half of you do and that's great but,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:28.410" end="00:07:32.360">what I think you'll see in this next demo is that in twenty fifteen</p>
      <p begin="00:07:32.360" end="00:07:42.400">...a whole lot more reasons why you want to sign in visual studio?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:47.360">So, this is the release candidate build a visual studio twenty fifty and is the sign</p>
      <p begin="00:07:47.360" end="00:07:50.830">...for those of you obviously...spotted before...the using</p>
      <p begin="00:07:50.830" end="00:07:57.920">it that's fine I'm actually going to go ahead and sign in here and what I'm going to do is you can see</p>
      <p begin="00:07:57.920" end="00:08:01.720">our previously been using a another can here but I'm going to use my?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02.750" end="00:08:07.690">Microsoft account and this is...work or school account to give</p>
      <p begin="00:08:07.690" end="00:08:13.740">its proper name that's what the official term is but it's the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:13.740" end="00:08:18.430">account I used to sign on work we've had for a lot of feedback from</p>
      <p begin="00:08:18.430" end="00:08:22.220">various folks that it's very important for them not to have to have a</p>
      <p begin="00:08:22.220" end="00:08:25.470">separate live id from the...that from the one the...to sign at</p>
      <p begin="00:08:25.470" end="00:08:30.370">...you see here this is actually going to impose on me all of the same</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30.370" end="00:08:35.510">security requirements that I would have we have to factor of</p>
      <p begin="00:08:35.510" end="00:08:38.890">education at microsoft so I have to use a virtuous...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:38.890" end="00:08:43.820">here and I'm going to sign on but I'm signing on here with my</p>
      <p begin="00:08:43.820" end="00:08:50.630">work again and that's something that we know a lot of enterprise...of particularly been asking for.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:50.630" end="00:08:59.270">Once I do login though what's really been the point of the exercise.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:59.270" end="00:09:00.970">So,...see that it's.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:00.970" end="00:09:04.500">Logged in with my work account.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:04.500" end="00:09:08.580">...to pop open the account manager page here just to give you a</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.580" end="00:09:12.470">few pointers.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:12.470" end="00:09:16.060">You'll see that I've signed into what's known as my personalization account and that</p>
      <p begin="00:09:16.060" end="00:09:19.570">kinda gives you the first clue as to what we've been using this thing...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:19.570" end="00:09:24.270">those of you been using it before probably found that...a certain number of settings</p>
      <p begin="00:09:24.270" end="00:09:28.660">...in visual studio so that when you sign in on multiple boxes you don't have to go ahead and do</p>
      <p begin="00:09:28.660" end="00:09:33.620">all that tedious work...how you like the edit to sets up which windows you like</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.620" end="00:09:38.430">open etc that's a real pain and we recognize that people don't enjoy it and enjoy that a</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.430" end="00:09:43.140">...that since two thousand thirteen has been a feature we broaden the number of things that</p>
      <p begin="00:09:43.140" end="00:09:47.870">were actually writing now but much more interesting now is that we've also provided if you look at</p>
      <p begin="00:09:47.870" end="00:09:53.240">this area here a set of other accounts and you'll see another one is just appeared in as the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.240" end="00:09:55.250">writing settings came online?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:56.270" end="00:09:58.940">And, that is actually a...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:58.940" end="00:10:03.900">microsoft account that I'm also using the nice thing about visual studio twenty</p>
      <p begin="00:10:03.900" end="00:10:08.880">fifteen if we provide the ability vu to connect up to your personalization account here</p>
      <p begin="00:10:08.880" end="00:10:11.640">in the account manager as many as</p>
      <p begin="00:10:11.640" end="00:10:16.530">you want accounts that you use for other things so let's say for instance that you have a</p>
      <p begin="00:10:16.530" end="00:10:19.880">live account associated with your msdn subscription or live account</p>

      <p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:30.880">at any of those...can be chained up so you only have...once and that's the big deal</p>
      <p begin="00:10:30.880" end="00:10:34.050">here that's the goal so that we provide a single sign</p>
      <p begin="00:10:34.050" end="00:10:38.940">in experience visual studio that manages all of the kinds of a camps that you care about with respect to</p>
      <p begin="00:10:38.940" end="00:10:44.520">the development activities and we'll see how that plays out we take a look over here</p>
      <p begin="00:10:44.520" end="00:10:51.020">and server explorer.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:51.020" end="00:10:58.280">Occasionallywhen you first sign in you will find that?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:58.280" end="00:11:00.300">You have to sign in.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:00.300" end="00:11:05.140">...each account and that's fine and the reason for that is because we don't</p>
      <p begin="00:11:05.140" end="00:11:09.890">want to be a caching your credentials when you log out we...leave those lying around on the</p>
      <p begin="00:11:09.890" end="00:11:15.020">machines so since I just signed in I should never see that dialogue but I just</p>
      <p begin="00:11:15.020" end="00:11:19.670">...once as long as I stay signed into visual studio all of the camps that</p>
      <p begin="00:11:19.670" end="00:11:23.980">...signed into will remain in place so you can see that can see all of my</p>
      <p begin="00:11:23.980" end="00:11:27.200">...subscriptions and that means.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:27.200" end="00:11:31.910">That when I cracking open for instance this web apps node will actually go ahead and find</p>
      <p begin="00:11:31.910" end="00:11:36.470">the test databases actually this one is actually attached to my msdn subscription that</p>
      <p begin="00:11:36.470" end="00:11:41.570">access through that live...that the microsoft account so I can have as many of those</p>
      <p begin="00:11:41.570" end="00:11:47.530">accounts as I...to access as many services as I wish to access and, we hope that you'll find that</p>
      <p begin="00:11:47.530" end="00:11:52.990">to...useful feature.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:52.990" end="00:11:57.940">Another feature that we've added which I think you'll find hopefully useful in terms</p>
      <p begin="00:11:57.940" end="00:12:02.180">of being personalize...to the way you use the world how many</p>
      <p begin="00:12:02.180" end="00:12:06.660">of you systematically ignore notifications in visual studio?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:06.660" end="00:12:08.180">Yeah, I figure as much.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:13.890">And, the reason for that I we recognize that there's been a certain amount of</p>
      <p begin="00:12:13.890" end="00:12:19.930">...noise and lack of...in the notifications experience</p>
      <p begin="00:12:19.930" end="00:12:24.850">is...didn't necessarily see things that you ted about ok well in twenty fifty in the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:24.850" end="00:12:30.280">world is changing what you're seeing here don't worry the world hasn't suddenly moved forward to the middle</p>
      <p begin="00:12:30.280" end="00:12:35.110">of next year or whatever that might happen visual studio twenty fifteen update one is not</p>
      <p begin="00:12:35.110" end="00:12:41.060">...hissed but we're seeing here is what the new notifications experience looks like</p>
      <p begin="00:12:41.060" end="00:12:44.610">I'm just put some sample items into the notification hub here for</p>
      <p begin="00:12:44.610" end="00:12:47.930">you to say you see a couple of things here.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:47.930" end="00:12:51.130">Firstly we've introduced some categorization you can see that...a category</p>
      <p begin="00:12:51.130" end="00:12:53.590">...product updates and the category</p>
      <p begin="00:12:53.590" end="00:12:57.650">here that's a tentative one with thinking about around troubleshooting...what another</p>
      <p begin="00:12:57.650" end="00:13:02.710">benefits of signing in by the way is that when you sign in it gives us the opportunity when you send</p>
      <p begin="00:13:02.710" end="00:13:07.930">a smil which is this little guy up here if you haven't used them to send feedback to actually get in</p>
      <p begin="00:13:07.930" end="00:13:12.790">touch with you and close the loop about some problems that you might be saying anyway that's</p>
      <p begin="00:13:12.790" end="00:13:18.170">...side we now have categories in the notifications</p>
      <p begin="00:13:18.170" end="00:13:22.080">And,...that should hopefully help you to find the things that you care about</p>
      <p begin="00:13:22.080" end="00:13:27.190">...this guy...the top is what we call a promoted notification</p>
      <p begin="00:13:27.190" end="00:13:32.860">and those are really for things that we think everybody needs to know and, that are incredibly</p>
      <p begin="00:13:32.860" end="00:13:36.930">high importance so obviously we think are updates are really important but the kinds of things you</p>
      <p begin="00:13:36.930" end="00:13:40.330">also see up there is if you're licenses about to</p>
      <p begin="00:13:40.330" end="00:13:43.950">expire you would see that and you also see the read notification like up in the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:43.950" end="00:13:49.750">tallwhen that happens one final piece of personalization is the always ignore</p>
      <p begin="00:13:49.750" end="00:13:54.400">button...so if you've decided that and,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:54.400" end="00:13:57.750">I really don't think you should decide this but...sake of argument</p>
      <p begin="00:13:57.750" end="00:14:02.390">...say that you just aren't interested in application...I think that would be a mistake but</p>
      <p begin="00:14:02.390" end="00:14:09.460">you'll call I can say I want to see updates like that in the future I can always signal</p>
      <p begin="00:14:09.460" end="00:14:15.140">...it's actually got a little bit are you sure here but it's now...always ignored state and assumes</p>
      <p begin="00:14:15.140" end="00:14:19.470">I quit the notifications with...on legacy updates of that...again so what</p>
      <p begin="00:14:19.470" end="00:14:24.340">...allows you to do is team down your experience so you just see stuff that you care about and hopefully</p>
      <p begin="00:14:24.340" end="00:14:29.180">we'll find a because we take telemetry on this kind of thing well,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:29.180" end="00:14:35.810">actually find out what it is you guys really care about...so it'll help us tonightwhat's going on?</p>
      <p begin="00:14:35.810" end="00:14:40.240">So, that's notifications just one of what quickly.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:40.240" end="00:14:44.680">The...here you see that it dates works with your work or</p>
      <p begin="00:14:44.680" end="00:14:51.660">school accounts and not only do we...your settings but we also...connected services.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:53.140" end="00:14:58.510">we've reduced the cluster and hopefully we've allowed you to see any what you care about another way that</p>
      <p begin="00:14:58.510" end="00:15:03.500">we're working to make sure that we work with all of the or devices and a personalize to the device world</p>
      <p begin="00:15:03.500" end="00:15:08.150">that you're living in is that we've added we've been working since visual</p>
      <p begin="00:15:08.150" end="00:15:13.010">studio twenty thirteen to improve our high dpi support now I see a number of</p>
      <p begin="00:15:13.010" end="00:15:16.060">you a packing surface threes or some and a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:15:16.060" end="00:15:20.720">high dpi devices on the market today more people working on them and we know that we want to</p>
      <p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:25.160">provide first-class experience that we did a bunch of work in twenty thirteen</p>
      <p begin="00:15:25.160" end="00:15:30.110">to get ourselves better in that world and one of the things that you'll probably notice if</p>
      <p begin="00:15:30.110" end="00:15:33.970">you're running on a high dpi device with twenty fifteen is that we've</p>
      <p begin="00:15:33.970" end="00:15:39.060">...really upped the ante on icons and I hope you can see that the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:39.060" end="00:15:43.070">...the toolbar the top is not-so-nice as the one at the bottom that there</p>
      <p begin="00:15:43.070" end="00:15:47.430">are some nice improvements in clarity...christmas on those icons that</p>
      <p begin="00:15:47.430" end="00:15:52.390">high dpi and that's something you'll see throughout the product because this is actually a service that we have</p>
      <p begin="00:15:52.390" end="00:15:58.240">within visual studio...allows everyone who works inside the visual studio environment to</p>
      <p begin="00:15:58.240" end="00:16:01.890">pick-up icons high dpi nice crisp icons you should see that</p>
      <p begin="00:16:01.890" end="00:16:07.510">improvement spreading throughout the product another way that we're taking into account.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:07.510" end="00:16:11.610">Your particular device preferences is better shown in a</p>
      <p begin="00:16:12.990" end="00:16:17.350">I personally have a laptop here that I work on all the time when I'm out</p>
      <p begin="00:16:17.350" end="00:16:22.490">in aboutmaybe I'm at home and that's what that's my typical environment for a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:16:22.490" end="00:16:27.120">of time but I also work have a multimodal sets up now I'm sure that's not on typical</p>
      <p begin="00:16:27.120" end="00:16:32.560">right a lot of you guys probably working a multimodal setups as well one of the things that's a real royal</p>
      <p begin="00:16:32.560" end="00:16:37.140">...when I'm working with visual studio is to have to keep rearranging all of my</p>
      <p begin="00:16:37.140" end="00:16:41.210">tool windows said that they work with the particular environment that I'm working on so we've</p>
      <p begin="00:16:41.210" end="00:16:46.170">got a nice new feature here which allows you to deal with exactly that scenario</p>
      <p begin="00:16:46.170" end="00:16:52.260">...see here on the window menu we have a new feature that allows you just save a window layout</p>
      <p begin="00:16:52.260" end="00:16:56.400">okay and that would allow me for instance if I chose save when...here I could make</p>
      <p begin="00:16:56.400" end="00:17:01.980">...named...and that would store away all of the layouts of all the tool windows</p>
      <p begin="00:17:01.980" end="00:17:04.540">...part of visual studio now rather than create</p>
      <p begin="00:17:04.540" end="00:17:08.340">...new one here actually made a couple already because the flip side of that is you</p>
      <p begin="00:17:08.340" end="00:17:13.740">can also apply them dynamically say let's suppose that I'm back at my big</p>
      <p begin="00:17:13.740" end="00:17:17.990">multimodal setup I can just say control to and</p>
      <p begin="00:17:17.990" end="00:17:22.550">...this up and you can see now actually doesn't look great on this screen and that's not surprising because</p>
      <p begin="00:17:22.550" end="00:17:27.420">it's currently running...laptop but just to illustrate that picked up all of my to windows that and I can have</p>
      <p begin="00:17:27.420" end="00:17:32.190">as many of those named lapses I one I can go nuts on that if I have different ways of working in</p>
      <p begin="00:17:32.190" end="00:17:37.370">...perhaps when I'm working in a designer I use a certain set of to windows when I'm working</p>

      <p begin="00:17:41.390" end="00:17:46.140">name it if you've got different tool windows that you like to have up and you want to switch quickly and easily</p>
      <p begin="00:17:46.140" end="00:17:53.590">between those super easy to do that now so I'm actually going to go ahead and the switch back.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:53.590" end="00:17:56.400">My laptop environment and you can see that as easy as the</p>
      <p begin="00:17:56.400" end="00:18:02.520">hit a button very straightforward to use the nice thing is those are actually roamed although the</p>

      <p begin="00:19:17.590" end="00:19:23.650">inside of your code we think it's really important that we enable that first however we do think that</p>
      <p begin="00:19:23.650" end="00:19:28.650">...going forward is probably going to be more than that and the id so we'd be interested to hear from you guys</p>

      <p begin="00:19:54.930" end="00:19:59.770">So, that...the...of today's discussion what I really want to show</p>
      <p begin="00:19:59.770" end="00:20:04.430">you here is how we've done some work in visual studio to improve?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:04.430" end="00:20:07.420">The find fix cycle as we call it so,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:07.420" end="00:20:12.150">how we how we work with finding and fixing issues in your code I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:20:12.150" end="00:20:19.050">to actually take a short detour through a few other little bits and pieces in the editor but,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:19.050" end="00:20:23.160">we will get to finding and fixing stuff fairly quickly so please when I switch</p>
      <p begin="00:20:23.160" end="00:20:26.740">back then obsess about the reads google you'll be saying?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:26.740" end="00:20:30.920">We're going to obsess about it now there's a reads we go right there it is</p>
      <p begin="00:20:30.920" end="00:20:36.020">...you can't help yourself any.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:36.020" end="00:20:41.480">Anyhow so first I would like to say that one of the tenets that</p>
      <p begin="00:20:41.480" end="00:20:47.490">we've always had releases visual studio two thousand twelve is that we...you to</p>

      <p begin="00:21:40.180" end="00:21:40.680">Definition.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:43.570" end="00:21:45.810">We'll get a...straight into the method</p>
      <p begin="00:21:45.810" end="00:21:50.190">okay and the nice thing about paint the really nice thing is it doesn't stop there so</p>
      <p begin="00:21:50.190" end="00:21:56.550">for instance if I'm if I decide I'm interested in this event handler I can peak again.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:56.550" end="00:22:01.540">And,...starts...a nice little breadcrumbs riled up at the top here and those by the way if you</p>
      <p begin="00:22:01.540" end="00:22:05.770">have discover them there's a keyboard shortcut for backing enforcing through those and,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:05.770" end="00:22:09.780">that's control control.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:09.780" end="00:22:13.850">Alt and minus to go back and control plus to go forward so there's a couple</p>
      <p begin="00:22:13.850" end="00:22:18.700">you really useful shortcuts if you're working with...I know lots of folks...work with the</p>
      <p begin="00:22:18.700" end="00:22:23.540">edits...really want to keep their hands-off the mouse and say we're pretty keno keyboard shortcuts which is why I'm kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:22:23.540" end="00:22:28.540">disappointed all...twelve this playing up on this machine at this point.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:28.540" end="00:22:33.100">Nevertheless say web...is a great experience for keeping you in context so you can always see</p>
      <p begin="00:22:33.100" end="00:22:37.260">way you started your journey through the code and you can always track back and</p>
      <p begin="00:22:37.260" end="00:22:42.160">forth without ever losing that context and that principle is one that we think is very useful</p>
      <p begin="00:22:42.160" end="00:22:49.310">and lots of other places too so we've taken the idea and run with it and a couple other places.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:49.310" end="00:22:59.470">And, I'm just going to show you some of those now.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:59.470" end="00:23:06.650">So, this is a xhtml project I'm going to crockett and...here.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:06.650" end="00:23:10.240">...going to select one of these buttons and you'll notice that I have some</p>
      <p begin="00:23:10.240" end="00:23:14.830">styles associated with those buttons here now wouldn't it be neat if.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:14.830" end="00:23:17.210">You know, what's coming...</p>
      <p begin="00:23:17.210" end="00:23:22.600">Wouldn't it be neat if you could pick...definition for styles to?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:22.600" end="00:23:27.500">Furthermore wouldn't it be neat if you could just live it...those and see the results on the design</p>
      <p begin="00:23:27.500" end="00:23:34.540">and I think that's pretty nice so,...definition works.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:34.540" end="00:23:39.160">Right here in this animal designer which is great normal getting lost in</p>
      <p begin="00:23:39.160" end="00:23:46.500">endless chains of dictionaries this should make life a whole lot easier, for example, develop we had.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:46.500" end="00:23:53.060">Next thing that we've done with...just go ahead here and</p>
      <p begin="00:23:53.060" end="00:23:57.690">set a bright point on this line you may have seen this in some of the earlier demos but if you have</p>
      <p begin="00:23:57.690" end="00:24:02.100">noticed it let's suppose now that I want to set some conditional</p>
      <p begin="00:24:02.100" end="00:24:03.680">break points.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:03.680" end="00:24:09.610">We've now invented something that you might call...dialogue ok so if you</p>
      <p begin="00:24:09.610" end="00:24:14.060">...the debug settings...before you'll probably</p>
      <p begin="00:24:14.060" end="00:24:18.980">have notice that it comes up in a and a dialogue box that probably obscures the code that you're working on</p>
      <p begin="00:24:18.980" end="00:24:23.920">the nice thing about a...is that it sits inline...and into linear thing it's between</p>
      <p begin="00:24:23.920" end="00:24:28.070">your lines of code and it never ever obscures the code that you</p>
      <p begin="00:24:28.070" end="00:24:30.890">were looking at when you invoked so</p>
      <p begin="00:24:30.890" end="00:24:35.630">same benefits apply here what this means is now if I'm wanting to set some conditions here</p>
      <p begin="00:24:35.630" end="00:24:40.530">I can tell that I'm actually in the context of something that's going to have these variables so I can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:24:40.530" end="00:24:45.250">start typing meaningful conditionals here that actually refer to the code that I'm working</p>
      <p begin="00:24:45.250" end="00:24:50.560">and without actually losing the code that I need to refer to we think that's important so that's another use of</p>
      <p begin="00:24:50.560" end="00:24:57.900">...the you'll see...twenty fifteen and we...you like that one too.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:57.900" end="00:25:01.050">Another place where we work hard to ensure</p>
      <p begin="00:25:01.050" end="00:25:06.760">that we don't lose your context whilst you're looking at your code.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:06.760" end="00:25:09.190">In giving you understanding of...code via code</p>
      <p begin="00:25:09.190" end="00:25:12.580">...okay so you probably many</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.580" end="00:25:17.810">of noticed if you've not seen it beforecode lenses up here.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:17.810" end="00:25:20.350">Above in a...csharp file its</p>
      <p begin="00:25:20.350" end="00:25:26.590">here above the method heading and you can see that I can actually look at things like changes references</p>
      <p begin="00:25:26.590" end="00:25:29.780">insightful when I...guide and once again this is</p>
      <p begin="00:25:29.780" end="00:25:35.630">the supported by a keyboard shortcut which is alt and then the number of the lens that you're using...the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:35.630" end="00:25:40.450">code lenses and extensible mechanism you can see now that I've got my changes and</p>
      <p begin="00:25:40.450" end="00:25:45.030">there obviously this is a demo project on the demo getrepo so they're not</p>
      <p begin="00:25:45.030" end="00:25:49.710">terribly interesting changes but you could imagine real-world project that...be seeing the changes</p>
      <p begin="00:25:49.710" end="00:25:54.530">from your team so you can get that context on what's happening in your projects and there's also a</p>
      <p begin="00:25:54.530" end="00:25:59.460">...for looking at unit test...coverage and that kind of thing</p>
      <p begin="00:25:59.460" end="00:26:04.230">...the reference one which is probably the one that a lot of people use the most which allows you to dive</p>
      <p begin="00:26:04.230" end="00:26:09.620">off the references to methods so forth but all of those...you as a uniform set to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:09.620" end="00:26:13.950">keep your focus on the code whilst actually understanding more about the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:13.950" end="00:26:18.170">code so you never have believed in order to find out more that's...</p>
      <p begin="00:26:18.170" end="00:26:23.390">that well that's the twenty thirteen fiji probably saying and...you showed me this...twenty fifteen</p>
      <p begin="00:26:23.390" end="00:26:30.310">to well the world has changed and if you looked carefully at that style dictionary</p>
      <p begin="00:26:30.310" end="00:26:36.520">...file you might have...that down at the bottom there's a new kind of lenz okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:36.520" end="00:26:39.870">And, I'll show it magnified here for a moment then I'll actually go</p>
      <p begin="00:26:39.870" end="00:26:44.790">and actuator and you can see here that what showing me is some of that</p>

      <p begin="00:27:30.230" end="00:27:35.420">Now the moment you been waiting for I'm going to get back to the read squiggles.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:35.420" end="00:27:39.750">So,...clearly this project has some errors in it and that's not</p>
      <p begin="00:27:39.750" end="00:27:43.320">...state for me you may be</p>
      <p begin="00:27:43.320" end="00:27:49.650">...than I am sure...it's pretty common to have errors and issues in your code and,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:49.650" end="00:27:52.510">what we've tried to do in visual studio twenty fifteen</p>
      <p begin="00:27:52.510" end="00:27:57.450">...and experience that...both find and fix those issues more easily</p>
      <p begin="00:27:57.450" end="00:28:02.270">than you could before so let's take a look at what that looks like?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:02.270" end="00:28:05.520">Firstly you'll notice here in the error list that there</p>
      <p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:10.650">are a few a small changes that ...you may have noticed...you'll see that we</p>
      <p begin="00:28:10.650" end="00:28:15.480">now have a link here in the code column more on the moment but</p>
      <p begin="00:28:15.480" end="00:28:20.400">you also find that when we double-click on item here.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:20.400" end="00:28:24.760">I'm going to just quickly zoom in you'll see that are</p>
      <p begin="00:28:24.760" end="00:28:29.340">lightbulb has appeared on the line that I navigated to say where the light bulb is a new</p>
      <p begin="00:28:29.340" end="00:28:32.980">two thousand fifteen feature if you use the roslyn preview</p>
      <p begin="00:28:32.980" end="00:28:37.770">bits before you may have seen it...earlier iteration there this is now</p>
      <p begin="00:28:37.770" end="00:28:45.330">platform feature that is available across all languages not just the one supported by the...compiler.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:45.330" end="00:28:48.780">Light bulbs are a new way of exposing</p>
      <p begin="00:28:48.780" end="00:28:52.540">fixes and quick actions that we can take on...</p>
      <p begin="00:28:52.540" end="00:29:00.110">ok so let's go and that guy what does he show is.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:00.110" end="00:29:04.260">Little bit of a tour of the anatomy here first you'll see that</p>
      <p begin="00:29:04.260" end="00:29:09.110">on the left here I'm seeing a whole list of things that I could do to fix</p>
      <p begin="00:29:09.110" end="00:29:14.420">the problem that I was experiencing so, there are various different options and as I</p>
      <p begin="00:29:14.420" end="00:29:19.030">move down through them in a moment you'll see that the preview which is over on the right-hand</p>
      <p begin="00:29:19.030" end="00:29:23.600">side actually shows me what I'm going to get when I take that</p>
      <p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:26.640">action so you'll see here in this case I'm getting a green-line for</p>
      <p begin="00:29:26.640" end="00:29:29.520">...paint dot...which is going to be added to the top of</p>
      <p begin="00:29:29.520" end="00:29:34.900">my the code and I can have complete confidence...what that action is going to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:34.900" end="00:29:39.680">...particular single file cases and in many cases fixes are single file so you can pretty</p>
      <p begin="00:29:39.680" end="00:29:46.440">much take them based only on what you're seeing in that preview we think that useful.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:46.440" end="00:29:50.190">So, what control...which is actually the for some reason</p>
      <p begin="00:29:50.190" end="00:29:53.910">my keyboards not playing ball control dot</p>
      <p begin="00:29:53.910" end="00:29:58.940">visual friend it's the control period it's actually they should keyboard shortcuts and you'll see</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.940" end="00:30:02.020">that's when we hover over the...to tells us about</p>
      <p begin="00:30:02.020" end="00:30:06.900">that allows us very quickly to move through items</p>
      <p begin="00:30:06.900" end="00:30:11.540">from the keyboard so I can from the airlift I just go</p>
      <p begin="00:30:11.540" end="00:30:18.320">...to move through my...for instance as I move on to a new...</p>
      <p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:21.360">I will actually find myself.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:21.360" end="00:30:25.250">To immediately take the action I'm going to use the massive...some reason like he was</p>
      <p begin="00:30:25.250" end="00:30:32.980">playing up control dot would get me straight to here...I can reeve around within the.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:32.980" end="00:30:34.880">...to choose the action that I want.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:35.910" end="00:30:39.770">And, then quickly take it just by hitting enter ok so imagine</p>
      <p begin="00:30:39.770" end="00:30:44.700">if an in most cases we hope this is true the communist action will be at the top</p>
      <p begin="00:30:44.700" end="00:30:49.110">of the list so to fakes all I need to do is</p>
      <p begin="00:30:49.110" end="00:30:54.340">...eight in the error list control dot to bring up the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:54.340" end="00:30:58.900">light bulb and, my problem.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:58.900" end="00:31:02.700">Is fixed ok so that's a real quick workflow</p>
      <p begin="00:31:02.700" end="00:31:06.710">...controlled up...all if it's not the first choice</p>
      <p begin="00:31:06.710" end="00:31:10.970">...control dot move up and down with the arrow keys select the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:10.970" end="00:31:15.240">...you want it enter so we really tried to think about the keyboard interaction</p>
      <p begin="00:31:15.240" end="00:31:20.630">here because we know that most denies work hands-off the mouse a lot of the time so we want</p>
      <p begin="00:31:20.630" end="00:31:27.520">to make sure that works but as you've seen also it works great with the with the mouse as well?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:27.520" end="00:31:31.220">That's my first issues solved.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:31.220" end="00:31:33.470">I'm now going to roll down.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:33.470" end="00:31:38.780">And, as I roll down I notice because I've got pretty good eyes that this.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:38.780" end="00:31:42.020">Color here has got a slightly different colorized</p>
      <p begin="00:31:42.020" end="00:31:47.230">...than the similar-type comes elsewhere in the code now this</p>
      <p begin="00:31:47.230" end="00:31:52.540">is not as aggressive as a reads google so hopefully didn't draw your eyes straight away</p>
      <p begin="00:31:52.540" end="00:31:57.880">bob as...working you might notice things like this coming out and this is</p>
      <p begin="00:31:57.880" end="00:32:03.610">...a thing of class suggestion ok so basically if you're seeing one of these</p>
      <p begin="00:32:03.610" end="00:32:08.170">...to...you about this because it's not going to prevent you from compiling your code but what is</p>
      <p begin="00:32:08.170" end="00:32:13.020">trying to tell you is there's a there's a thing that could improve here if you if you want to take a look</p>
      <p begin="00:32:13.020" end="00:32:18.330">...and to try fixing...try that and it's the same lightbulb you can see it's telling is that the</p>
      <p begin="00:32:18.330" end="00:32:22.560">...redundant which you probably spotted already and,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:22.560" end="00:32:24.280">here we're seeing that very same experience.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:25.550" end="00:32:29.960">Okay, what we have is the remove unnecessary gauss which is the only option we have available to</p>
      <p begin="00:32:29.960" end="00:32:34.850">...you can see the preview...telling is exactly what we're going to get in this single file</p>
      <p begin="00:32:34.850" end="00:32:38.260">in this case it's kind of interesting tonight that we've also got the option?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:39.480" end="00:32:44.500">Of taking the action at a different scope okay so we can take that action</p>

      <p begin="00:36:15.510" end="00:36:18.570">I think it's not that uncommon...</p>

      <p begin="00:36:41.330" end="00:36:45.930">typed analyses run alive then requirements and batch things up</p>

      <p begin="00:36:49.720" end="00:36:54.540">now we're moving a lot of things out of the static analysis world into the</p>
      <p begin="00:36:54.540" end="00:36:58.600">...world as you might expect to take advantage of this feature because this means that as</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.600" end="00:37:02.630">you're typing you get the information you need...not only that you get the...which is pretty cool</p>
      <p begin="00:37:03.970" end="00:37:07.930">but, there's still going to be a ton of things that are still living in</p>

      <p begin="00:37:09.820" end="00:37:23.220">That run statically so in the static analysis world and.</p>

      <p begin="00:37:29.880" end="00:37:32.930">The static analysis world has changed in visual studio twenty fifteen</p>
      <p begin="00:37:32.930" end="00:37:36.810">to so you might notice that all my code analysis results here</p>
      <p begin="00:37:36.810" end="00:37:41.540">...showing up in the error list why is that okay we like to think of the</p>
      <p begin="00:37:41.540" end="00:37:46.000">error list now as being kind of...one-stop-shop for everything that might</p>

      <p begin="00:37:55.160" end="00:37:59.560">pasta code analysis window was this separate thing that ran over here it was kind of not</p>
      <p begin="00:37:59.560" end="00:38:03.430">integrative and that didn't really make a ton of sense particularly in the light of the fact that a</p>
      <p begin="00:38:03.430" end="00:38:07.410">lot of analysis is now going to be done life anyway and that's the trend</p>
      <p begin="00:38:07.410" end="00:38:12.390">in analysis so we thought it would be much better if you actually had a way to see</p>
      <p begin="00:38:12.390" end="00:38:18.430">all of the things that might be or to do list if you like for the code located in one spot and</p>
      <p begin="00:38:18.430" end="00:38:24.260">that's the error list map you might be saying well heck now I've got all this junk in my error list item one</p>
      <p begin="00:38:24.260" end="00:38:30.200">that while we thought about that too and the other thing that we've done in the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:30.200" end="00:38:34.460">airlift here...actually a whole bunch of things that we've done in the errors but the thing that I think</p>
      <p begin="00:38:34.460" end="00:38:38.890">you'll find useful is we've actually enabled I'm just going to</p>
      <p begin="00:38:38.890" end="00:38:41.850">...column here.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:41.850" end="00:38:46.640">The ability to dynamically filter your error list so that you can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:49.610">...on the thing that you care about most.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:49.610" end="00:38:54.680">So, in this case for instance let's suppose...somebody had done that big static analysis run</p>
      <p begin="00:38:54.680" end="00:38:59.880">and we've got a bunch of bugs and I decided that actually what I really want to do is focusing on the naming</p>
      <p begin="00:38:59.880" end="00:39:02.920">bugs you can see we've implemented xcel style filtering here so if</p>
      <p begin="00:39:02.920" end="00:39:07.920">...used xcel tables you've seen that they have this notion of being able to</p>
      <p begin="00:39:07.920" end="00:39:12.610">the filter each column based on its contents so we've done the same thing...the same</p>
      <p begin="00:39:12.610" end="00:39:17.420">paradigm and what we can see here is that we have a certain number of naming issues?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:17.420" end="00:39:20.170">And, I'm going to focus in on those first.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:20.170" end="00:39:24.170">And, I'm kinda interested in this first one which is that I've got</p>
      <p begin="00:39:24.170" end="00:39:28.450">...utilize name space and the tool is saying well you really shouldn't use utilitze</p>
      <p begin="00:39:28.450" end="00:39:33.850">and abbreviation how do I know that by the way while I can hit my</p>
      <p begin="00:39:33.850" end="00:39:35.390">cuddling here?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:35.390" end="00:39:36.710">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:36.710" end="00:39:39.310">...of the universal features that we...in the error</p>
      <p begin="00:39:39.310" end="00:39:43.030">...now is you can be able to get a link to the error</p>
      <p begin="00:39:43.030" end="00:39:49.590">in question as much as we can find it right from within the...and you can hit that up by the by clicking the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:49.590" end="00:39:52.820">...fone and...when you're selecting an error in the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:52.820" end="00:39:58.640">airlift now they're going to be cases where you don't actually have a direct matched for instance if you</p>
      <p begin="00:39:58.640" end="00:40:03.590">using someone else's library that actually doesn't have static documentation built for it</p>
      <p begin="00:40:03.590" end="00:40:08.630">yet and those cases we know that often times you're going to be picking up the internet you</p>
      <p begin="00:40:08.630" end="00:40:12.190">...going...a bing search for that or a search with other search...</p>
      <p begin="00:40:14.260" end="00:40:18.630">...going to be searching you probably going to have to strip out a bunch of stuff you usual workflow</p>
      <p begin="00:40:18.630" end="00:40:24.320">might be copy and paste from the airlift pop into some search box and it return and,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:24.320" end="00:40:28.340">you get some search results and that'll be great and it might help you solve your...what we've actually done</p>
      <p begin="00:40:28.340" end="00:40:33.270">now in twenty fifteen is we you'll notice that we send searches</p>
      <p begin="00:40:33.270" end="00:40:38.560">straight debate we actually formulate that search...for you.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:42.210">And, we're working with the being team to actually make that search ever</p>
      <p begin="00:40:42.210" end="00:40:46.310">more appropriate to the code that you're working on so we actually send a little bit</p>

      <p begin="00:40:49.970" end="00:40:55.640">that we can get better search results so, you should find that even when it's not and like it is in this</p>

      <p begin="00:55:31.420" end="00:55:31.920">Doing.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:33.060" end="00:55:39.290">...just...unlawful for this...this up one of the things with visual studio...</p>
      <p begin="00:55:39.290" end="00:55:44.730">things tremendous id probably I've been developing for fifteen years and</p>
      <p begin="00:55:44.730" end="00:55:50.020">I find it's very solid...when it comes to doing things such as like mark-up</p>
      <p begin="00:55:50.020" end="00:55:54.860">and more like less not like dot net for server-side stuff I some</p>
      <p begin="00:55:54.860" end="00:56:00.290">feel it's almost like not over killed but it doesn't feel as lean online as I want to funders doing</p>
      <p begin="00:56:00.290" end="00:56:06.010">markup like client-side styling...is there anythingthat</p>
      <p begin="00:56:06.010" end="00:56:10.760">you guys would be looking at to make it a little more of a choice and maybe using something like sublime</p>
      <p begin="00:56:10.760" end="00:56:17.860">orone of the things that hopefully...in the keynote this morning was one option that's coming around</p>
      <p begin="00:56:17.860" end="00:56:22.980">there is the new visual studio code environment which provides a super lightweight environment and</p>
      <p begin="00:56:22.980" end="00:56:26.710">I know the recessions here a build about that but,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:26.710" end="00:56:31.330">we're also interested to think about whether there's actually something that we could do inside visual studio in the future</p>
      <p begin="00:56:31.330" end="00:56:35.980">...I'm interested say that piece of feedback I think there are lots of</p>
      <p begin="00:56:35.980" end="00:56:39.690">...like the really super lightweight environment and just to ask a question back</p>
      <p begin="00:56:39.690" end="00:56:45.230">in return and I'd love to...the where I'm going to be on the visual studio stand in the</p>
      <p begin="00:56:45.230" end="00:56:49.290">...platform tools area later so-if you want-to put by that'd be great</p>
      <p begin="00:56:50.470" end="00:56:54.890">but, what seven yet I think we may have scope for a</p>
      <p begin="00:56:54.890" end="00:56:59.800">lightweight environment even within the visual studio area to in possible features</p>
      <p begin="00:56:59.800" end="00:57:04.050">I'm wondering whether your goal there is this the style of editing</p>
      <p begin="00:57:04.050" end="00:57:08.890">where you're literally just sitting up files almost using file association and...popping a file open</p>
      <p begin="00:57:08.890" end="00:57:13.570">in the editor of you really don't care very much maybe even about solutions and projects particularly in</p>
      <p begin="00:57:13.570" end="00:57:19.580">the worldmany things don't even have them ...and you're much more interested in just...opening editor</p>
      <p begin="00:57:19.580" end="00:57:24.960">...and community does look good I haven't played with the yet so maybe that would be a solution</p>
      <p begin="00:57:24.960" end="00:57:30.060">but if you are doing a lot of...would be nice to suh maybe toggle</p>
      <p begin="00:57:30.060" end="00:57:36.400">so now I'm hearing another story which is kind of the idea that</p>
      <p begin="00:57:36.400" end="00:57:41.210">...just too many features and you just want to see the ones that relate to the thing that you're working on is</p>
      <p begin="00:57:41.210" end="00:57:43.590">...a miami...yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:43.590" end="00:57:48.960">okay, that's also something we've been talking about so that's good feedback we don't have anything right now it</p>
      <p begin="00:57:48.960" end="00:57:51.810">looks like we now have something at both ends of the spectrum a super lightweight</p>
      <p begin="00:57:51.810" end="00:57:57.570">...visual studio code and then the full id and...</p>
      <p begin="00:57:57.570" end="00:58:03.330">In the main product and even on...like a set of with the id when you initial</p>
      <p begin="00:58:03.330" end="00:58:08.870">...doing more web cpr yep ...an option to say</p>
      <p begin="00:58:08.870" end="00:58:12.940">...mode and that is your lightweight word is yes the heavier,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:12.940" end="00:58:18.290">yeah, I like the idea I think it's something we definitely need to discuss the future releases</p>
      <p begin="00:58:18.290" end="00:58:24.650">...thanks and this looks this...so thank you thank you appreciate it.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:24.650" end="00:58:29.670">Hi, I'm assuming that a lot of the features for like the code...whatnot</p>
      <p begin="00:58:29.670" end="00:58:34.650">required do like if you have multiple projects to have like a project reference between them to be able</p>
      <p begin="00:58:34.650" end="00:58:38.580">to directly navigate...code and but a lot of times, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:38.580" end="00:58:42.000">when you want to have things or module you set up multiple solutions</p>
      <p begin="00:58:42.000" end="00:58:46.790">...you do assembly references in between them?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:46.790" end="00:58:48.240">And, I would assume that this code people</p>
      <p begin="00:58:48.240" end="00:58:53.130">...work with assembly references right well that's actually</p>
      <p begin="00:58:53.130" end="00:58:58.250">a question that's ...for the compiler guys but I think that's definitely a scenario that</p>
      <p begin="00:58:58.250" end="00:59:01.970">...off and one that they've been working on making...because really familial</p>
      <p begin="00:59:01.970" end="00:59:07.050">...video-only answers one hand I mean you own both multiple pieces</p>
      <p begin="00:59:07.050" end="00:59:13.720">...for...purposes you have to...reference absolutely and I'm pretty certain that's one that they've</p>
      <p begin="00:59:13.720" end="00:59:18.240">...my word for it...great feta...a dusters...</p>
      <p begin="00:59:18.240" end="00:59:24.100">there in this is dustin session would be a great place to go to...that question okay, but,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:24.100" end="00:59:26.830">they're also understands as well so but, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:26.830" end="00:59:35.240">that's absolutely scenario that they care...okay thank you bye.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:35.240" end="00:59:38.570">...thank you time and have a great build?</p>
