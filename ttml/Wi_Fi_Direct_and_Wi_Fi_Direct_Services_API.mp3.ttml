      <p begin="00:00:03.900" end="00:00:04.960">Hi, my name's you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:04.960" end="00:00:09.760">...gupta rpm in the windows organization for wi-fi and I'm here with</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.760" end="00:00:12.890">visual...three and we're going to spend some time talking to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.890" end="00:00:19.030">you today about wi-fi direct and wi-fi direct services in windows stand.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.030" end="00:00:23.620">Today we'll spend some time talking about what is wi-fi direct and wi-fi direct</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.620" end="00:00:28.270">services what can you do with this technology with these api what can you build</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.270" end="00:00:32.980">worker some of the very interesting scenarios...talk about what's new in windows</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.980" end="00:00:38.170">...then we'll walk through a demo will show you how all of this comes together</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.170" end="00:00:43.400">after that visuals going to walk you through how simple it...it is to write this code</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.400" end="00:00:46.800">and then we'll give you a couple of tips on debugging.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.190" end="00:00:52.670">In today's world most applications connect to the internet and provide a service to the</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.670" end="00:00:56.690">users such as facebook or yelp however there is a...of apps</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.690" end="00:01:01.630">...devices that can benefit from direct connectivity wi-fi direct and services is a</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.630" end="00:01:06.310">technology that provides this...direct connectivity it allows for</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.310" end="00:01:10.060">pc's phones are other devices running windows to connect to other</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.060" end="00:01:14.120">pc's phones or devices the unique value here is</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.120" end="00:01:18.670">that the devices do not need to be connected to the same access point or even to</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.670" end="00:01:22.280">...network they can just talk directly with each other once</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.280" end="00:01:26.750">you are connected once these devices are connected you have a very high-bandwidth</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.750" end="00:01:30.020">a pipe available to you so you can pump a lot of data you</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.020" end="00:01:33.560">could move videos you could sink a pc and of phone.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.560" end="00:01:34.700">And, it's not just</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.700" end="00:01:42.160">limited to devices we talked peer-to-peer but you could connect one device to many devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.160" end="00:01:44.570">Some of the interesting things that are built on this</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.570" end="00:01:49.470">technology are things like games so let's say you wanted to build a chess</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.470" end="00:01:54.430">application that two people could use in a park they need to be able</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.430" end="00:01:59.720">to find each other they need to be able to connect to each other these some very interesting things that start</p>
      <p begin="00:01:59.720" end="00:02:04.380">...and up when you have connectivity directly between two devices you could think about</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.380" end="00:02:06.580">application such as.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:06.580" end="00:02:10.340">Pc's...phones connecting to devices to control them so</p>
      <p begin="00:02:10.340" end="00:02:13.100">you have a printer you bring it out</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.100" end="00:02:17.970">...that printer you could do that over wi-fi direct a you could think about long</p>
      <p begin="00:02:17.970" end="00:02:22.790">tail devices such as a quadrant...or you want to be able to communicate with this you want to be able to send and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.790" end="00:02:27.640">receive messages from it and you want a long-range the range that comes with wi-fi you</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.640" end="00:02:33.100">could do this using wi-fi direct and services before we start getting into the details</p>
      <p begin="00:02:33.100" end="00:02:37.920">I wanted to explain the difference between wi-fi direct and wi-fi direct services both</p>
      <p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:42.620">of these technologies are industry standards you could use this technologies to talk between</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.620" end="00:02:46.020">of windows device another windows device or you could</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.020" end="00:02:50.500">...use these technologies to talk between windows and any other device that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:50.500" end="00:02:55.640">you're building wi-fi direct came first it allows you to find another device</p>
      <p begin="00:02:55.640" end="00:03:00.250">bear with it connect to it and communicate what wi-fi direct services</p>
      <p begin="00:03:00.250" end="00:03:04.800">ads is an additional layer on top of it so you can actually find the service running on the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:06.760">more device, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:06.760" end="00:03:11.190">if you were writing a game application you would from a pc find</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.190" end="00:03:16.150">another pc and that's not very valuable because the pc may or may not be running the game with</p>
      <p begin="00:03:16.150" end="00:03:20.990">wi-fi direct services you could actually find other people who are playing the same game in the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:20.990" end="00:03:25.990">city so you could connect and communicate with them let's talk about</p>
      <p begin="00:03:25.990" end="00:03:30.460">windows ten the api and what's new the first big change</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.460" end="00:03:34.030">from windows eight-point...to windows stand is that we've added</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.030" end="00:03:38.810">wi-fi direct services this concept did not exist in windows eight-point one this is a new</p>
      <p begin="00:03:38.810" end="00:03:43.730">emerging technology so we thought it was prudent to added to windows stand.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:43.730" end="00:03:48.540">The second thing is we have significantly, significantly enhance the api</p>
      <p begin="00:03:48.540" end="00:03:53.330">set for wi-fi direct and this is based on feedback that we get from isv,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.330" end="00:03:58.080">you know, things that they want to build things that they want to different how it would help them complete</p>
      <p begin="00:03:58.080" end="00:04:02.420">their scenarios so, let's talk about the api in windows</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02.420" end="00:04:05.310">...which is in sharp contrast from eight-point</p>
      <p begin="00:04:05.310" end="00:04:09.620">one the apps have complete control over the experience so the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.620" end="00:04:13.690">...can go and find device the app can go...with the device</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.690" end="00:04:18.620">and pairings important because we use a shared mediums or trust needs to be...the app can</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.620" end="00:04:22.860">going connect the app can communicate with the device and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:22.860" end="00:04:23.960">what if you're already getting</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.960" end="00:04:28.840">bored all of these are concepts that do not need to be exposed to the user</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.840" end="00:04:33.150">...eight-point one you had to use are user interface to go and find the device</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33.150" end="00:04:37.450">and then use your application and now you can completely do this from</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.450" end="00:04:42.300">within your application the second thing that we've added as an enhancement</p>
      <p begin="00:04:42.300" end="00:04:45.940">...update to the api is bidirectional control</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.940" end="00:04:50.830">...one when you use wi-fi direct you always have to find from windows you could</p>
      <p begin="00:04:50.830" end="00:04:55.750">find other devices from windows but you...find windows from other devices we had one directional</p>
      <p begin="00:04:55.750" end="00:04:59.060">support with windows time you can write</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.060" end="00:05:02.770">an application that says go find me other devices...you can go into a</p>
      <p begin="00:05:02.770" end="00:05:06.930">...that says hey let other people find me let other people find me as a device</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.930" end="00:05:13.000">let other people find me as a service and to get into a little bit more details of how powerful</p>
      <p begin="00:05:13.000" end="00:05:18.620">this api is applications consent custom information elementsand,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:18.620" end="00:05:22.830">they can read and write these elements if you're familiar with wi-fi</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.830" end="00:05:27.810">you would know that information elements is a standard extensibility mechanism so let's say</p>
      <p begin="00:05:27.810" end="00:05:31.330">I was building an application for device and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31.330" end="00:05:35.070">I can find the device the standard allows for me to know the name of the device</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.070" end="00:05:40.160">in the serial number but in my application I wanted to show the color of the device the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:40.160" end="00:05:44.170">device...information element that can be read by the application that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:44.170" end="00:05:48.880">knows the color so you could have better experience for the user you can read and write these</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.880" end="00:05:53.740">information elements we've also talked a lot about what happens to all those devices</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.740" end="00:05:58.870">are there that want direct connectivity but do not have wi-fi direct</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58.870" end="00:06:03.490">support we've added a mode so that windows can come up as a legacy ap</p>
      <p begin="00:06:03.490" end="00:06:07.080">or standard ap and what would happen when you go into that</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.080" end="00:06:11.140">node is any device that has wi-fi could connect to windows just as</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.140" end="00:06:16.610">a network we've also added low-level control and this is again something that you would be</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.610" end="00:06:21.340">familiar with if you're familiar with wi-fi direct but geo intent is a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:21.340" end="00:06:25.860">very low-level concept in wi-fi direct and are new api</p>
      <p begin="00:06:25.860" end="00:06:30.750">is powerful enough to let the application specify these parameters but,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:30.750" end="00:06:35.290">you know, what enough with the docking let's get into demo and see what all of this looks</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.290" end="00:06:37.310">like what we're going to show,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:37.310" end="00:06:41.900">you know, we've decided to show a swiss life application this applications going to show you all</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.900" end="00:06:46.470">the different parameters that you can move edit using your application you don't need to use all of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:46.470" end="00:06:50.870">them what we want to demonstrate is what all is available to you ve</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.870" end="00:06:55.730">...be going...each one of them what we'll do is we'll go through a demo of wi-fi direct</p>
      <p begin="00:06:55.730" end="00:07:01.600">and then wi-fi direct services and show you how services is different than direct</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.600" end="00:07:06.510">so let's get to the demo and were handed over...was going to talk a little bit about the api and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:06.510" end="00:07:10.250">then show the demo why phonetic api has to entities with differing</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.250" end="00:07:13.880">roles and that called as the advertiser and the connector</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.880" end="00:07:18.540">the advertiser advertises itself over wifi and the connector discovers advertiser and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.540" end="00:07:24.800">connects to it for this demo purposes my pc's going to be the advertiser and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:29.710">...discover my pc and connect to it so let's go ahead and start...advertiser</p>
      <p begin="00:07:29.710" end="00:07:38.460">to start...advertiser we need to turn on the listen state of the pc let's go ahead and do that?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:38.460" end="00:07:41.970">We then start the advertisers.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.970" end="00:07:46.900">At this point my pc's discoverable and other pc's can find it and connect to it so</p>
      <p begin="00:07:46.900" end="00:07:52.710">...thought why don't you discover my pc and connect to it let me go here and click</p>
      <p begin="00:07:52.710" end="00:07:59.130">on get devices which calls into the api to find other devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:59.130" end="00:08:04.650">All look I...shows pc there should I go...try to connect two-x short.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:04.650" end="00:08:07.460">...that pc and let me hit connect</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08.580" end="00:08:16.590">and windows is asking me if this is okay let's I'm going to say yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:16.590" end="00:08:22.620">And, I...connection requests from your cup I'm going-to go ahead and accept is requests.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:22.620" end="00:08:30.540">Windows is now asking me if it's okay to accept this request I'm going to say yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30.540" end="00:08:36.380">...connected so what we just showed you is a direct connection between these two</p>
      <p begin="00:08:36.380" end="00:08:40.950">not you could do this between a pc and of phone you could do this between a pc...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:40.950" end="00:08:45.680">any other device these devices are not on the same network in fact they're</p>
      <p begin="00:08:45.680" end="00:08:50.680">not even connected to any network so going back to our park scenario where, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:50.680" end="00:08:53.250">you...jess application you could find</p>
      <p begin="00:08:53.250" end="00:08:57.420">another bc in you could connect to it and you could start playing chess you do not need to</p>
      <p begin="00:08:57.420" end="00:09:02.230">show all these technical aspect in your application this is to illustrate, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:02.230" end="00:09:07.370">the diversity of the api is that we offer why...send-me some data let's see how</p>
      <p begin="00:09:07.370" end="00:09:11.960">...exchange looks.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:11.960" end="00:09:15.300">And, we're transferring some data between both these pc's.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.300" end="00:09:19.630">Next what we're going to show you is wi-fi direct services it's going to</p>
      <p begin="00:09:19.630" end="00:09:27.460">look very similar and will articulate the differences in there?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:27.460" end="00:09:31.930">So, I'm going to disconnect this closer device.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:31.930" end="00:09:39.010">For this we want to do it again...was locate writing...okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:39.010" end="00:09:52.790">So, let's go...one more we have...does this is...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:52.790" end="00:09:56.200">What we're going to show you now is wi-fi direct services in</p>
      <p begin="00:09:56.200" end="00:10:00.560">the previous demo one pc found other pc but with wi-fi</p>
      <p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:05.400">direct services you can actually find a service running on the pc so we</p>
      <p begin="00:10:05.400" end="00:10:15.520">show where'd you go ahead and let's create a...service on your pc?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:15.520" end="00:10:19.350">And, is that advertising itself now so by pc's advertising the build two</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.350" end="00:10:22.700">...fifteen service and...available for other seekers</p>
      <p begin="00:10:22.700" end="00:10:27.540">...and connect to it so you thought why don't you discover my service and connect</p>
      <p begin="00:10:27.540" end="00:10:29.910">to it so I'm going to go and look for the</p>

      <p begin="00:10:36.450" end="00:10:41.530">know the service that they were trying to find each other so the user doesn't need to type in all of this is something that</p>
      <p begin="00:10:41.530" end="00:10:46.760">...application can do so should I had get service...</p>
      <p begin="00:10:46.760" end="00:10:50.620">And, finding services.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:50.620" end="00:10:51.050">And, look,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:51.050" end="00:10:58.490">I found somebody else...this service...to select this...connect.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:58.490" end="00:11:06.470">I see a connection notification from...I'm going-to go ahead and accept...requests.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:06.470" end="00:11:09.490">And,...reconnected now we are connected over</p>
      <p begin="00:11:09.490" end="00:11:14.480">...services...click checked this session.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:19.270">how do I send some data between...of...so you need to basically ad udp port?</p>
      <p begin="00:11:19.270" end="00:11:24.230">Okay, so, you do that by a socializing random port number here.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:24.230" end="00:11:28.840">And, then just clicking on the tcp button here.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:28.840" end="00:11:37.860">At this point we are connected to what I'll forward and we can proceed with the sending data to each other.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:37.860" end="00:11:42.890">And, conceded...flowing both between both these...again the big difference here,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:42.890" end="00:11:47.160">you know, these demos looks similar but the big difference here is are you trying to find</p>
      <p begin="00:11:47.160" end="00:11:51.170">a device are you trying to find a service running on the device if you</p>
      <p begin="00:11:51.170" end="00:11:56.120">were building games you want to find a service running on the other device because you want to know who</p>
      <p begin="00:11:56.120" end="00:12:01.170">else is playing that game...the game lobby if you're trying to find just</p>
      <p begin="00:12:01.170" end="00:12:05.640">a tv or...phone or something you would use wi-fi direct so let's talk about the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:05.640" end="00:12:09.980">core that power's these...show if you could walk us through what it takes to build</p>
      <p begin="00:12:09.980" end="00:12:14.520">one of these applications short so from the demo app we saw that</p>
      <p begin="00:12:14.520" end="00:12:18.670">...direct api had to distinct roles...advertiser and the connector</p>
      <p begin="00:12:18.670" end="00:12:23.480">...connected to the advertiser let's take a look at how to write the advertisers to start</p>
      <p begin="00:12:23.480" end="00:12:25.900">...advertiser we instantiate an object of the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:25.900" end="00:12:28.780">...direct advertisement publisher class.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:28.780" end="00:12:34.850">The next thing that we do is return on the listen state for the advertiser we said that by setting</p>
      <p begin="00:12:34.850" end="00:12:39.790">the listen state discovery ability property proceeding we enabled advertiser to</p>
      <p begin="00:12:39.790" end="00:12:44.680">accept incoming connection requests from the connector we do that by instantiating</p>
      <p begin="00:12:44.680" end="00:12:49.870">an object of the...direct connection listener class we assign...call back to the connection</p>
      <p begin="00:12:49.870" end="00:12:54.060">...event handler so...a connector...to connect to the advertise at this</p>
      <p begin="00:12:54.060" end="00:12:58.920">...is fired we'll take a look at the connection handler even code in the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:58.920" end="00:13:00.950">next few slides.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:00.950" end="00:13:05.600">The finals step in starting the advertiser is to call the start method on the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:09.570">publisher that's it at this point but advertiser is advertising</p>
      <p begin="00:13:09.570" end="00:13:12.840">or wi-fi and is ready to accept incoming connection requests from the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:12.840" end="00:13:17.000">connector so what you're saying is if I wanted to make my pc</p>
      <p begin="00:13:17.000" end="00:13:21.940">discoverable it's as simple as you're doing these for steps</p>
      <p begin="00:13:21.940" end="00:13:25.410">correct all right let's talk to these guys about what happens next?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:26.480" end="00:13:29.140">Let's take a look at the connector...</p>
      <p begin="00:13:29.140" end="00:13:32.070">So, this is the other sign this was my pc which was trying to</p>
      <p begin="00:13:32.070" end="00:13:36.130">...your be correct to connect to the advertise that we need to find</p>
      <p begin="00:13:36.130" end="00:13:40.400">advertiser first this can be done by creating a query string for finding why</p>
      <p begin="00:13:40.400" end="00:13:43.120">for direct devices this query string can be</p>
      <p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:48.970">created by calling the get device selector method on the wi-fi direct device object.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:48.970" end="00:13:50.870">This query string.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:50.870" end="00:13:53.910">Also called as a device select that is then pass to the finally</p>
      <p begin="00:13:53.910" end="00:13:56.740">...method on the device information class.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:56.740" end="00:13:58.630">The finalizing method returns</p>
      <p begin="00:13:58.630" end="00:14:03.400">...device information collection object which contains device information objects</p>
      <p begin="00:14:03.400" end="00:14:07.890">which represent...devices found nearby the connector</p>
      <p begin="00:14:07.890" end="00:14:11.800">than proceeds by selecting the desired...device and connect</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.800" end="00:14:18.060">to connecting to it by calling the from id...method on the...direct device object.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:18.060" end="00:14:20.180">The from id asic method also takes</p>

      <p begin="00:14:24.330" end="00:14:27.300">...intents can be set.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:27.300" end="00:14:29.380">The from ideas thing method returns to a...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:29.380" end="00:14:35.540">direct device object which represents a connection to your advertiser finally the connector can</p>
      <p begin="00:14:35.540" end="00:14:39.640">proceed in obtaining the remote and local ip addresses by calling the get connection endpoint</p>
      <p begin="00:14:39.640" end="00:14:43.150">...method on this wi-fi direct device objects which</p>
      <p begin="00:14:43.150" end="00:14:45.830">these ip addresses the connector can then</p>
      <p begin="00:14:45.830" end="00:14:50.270">establishes socket connection with the advertiser so on one</p>
      <p begin="00:14:50.270" end="00:14:54.550">side we started been discoverable on the other side we found</p>
      <p begin="00:14:54.550" end="00:14:59.320">the device and tried to connect to it is there some more code on the first sign that</p>
      <p begin="00:14:59.320" end="00:15:05.110">...except the incoming connection yes the next slide I'm going to talk about that.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:05.110" end="00:15:07.380">So, remember that we had said</p>
      <p begin="00:15:07.380" end="00:15:11.440">...call back handler on the advertiser for...thing incoming</p>
      <p begin="00:15:11.440" end="00:15:16.380">connection requests from the connect let's take a look at how the code looks.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:16.380" end="00:15:20.370">So,...the connector tries to connect to the advertiser the connection requested even-handed</p>
      <p begin="00:15:20.370" end="00:15:24.250">...fired the advertiser can then retrieved disconnection</p>
      <p begin="00:15:24.250" end="00:15:28.790">request by calling the get connection request method on the requested event arcs</p>
      <p begin="00:15:29.890" end="00:15:34.580">the advertiser at this point can either choose to accept or reject the request.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:34.580" end="00:15:40.060">For this demo purposes we're going to accept the requests the advertiser can then called the from</p>
      <p begin="00:15:40.060" end="00:15:43.380">...segment on the...for direct device plus.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:43.380" end="00:15:48.520">And, parsing the device information id obtained from this connection requests.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:48.520" end="00:15:53.480">The successful completion of this...returns you...direct device object that represents</p>
      <p begin="00:15:53.480" end="00:15:58.290">...direct device connection to the connector the advertiser can then opt in</p>
      <p begin="00:15:58.290" end="00:16:02.850">ip addresses and proceed with the socket connection at this point both the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:02.850" end="00:16:04.860">advertiser and the connector</p>
      <p begin="00:16:04.860" end="00:16:10.330">...a socket and begin communication all right so that was wi-fi direct and,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:10.330" end="00:16:14.900">you know, what if it sounds like we rush through that...did not get it we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:16:14.900" end="00:16:19.880">share the full source code of the sample that we demonstrated here so you can start playing with it and building it</p>
      <p begin="00:16:19.880" end="00:16:24.330">into your own application but let's quickly also walk to wi-fi direct services, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:24.330" end="00:16:31.280">we showed to demos wi-fi direct and wi-fi direct services that's what to wi-fi direct services...</p>
      <p begin="00:16:31.280" end="00:16:35.950">So, similar to the lifer direct api concept the...services hasn't advertise</p>
      <p begin="00:16:35.950" end="00:16:40.800">...publishes...service over wifi and the...basically discovers this service and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:40.800" end="00:16:45.650">connects to it let's take a look at what it takes to start...to start...</p>
      <p begin="00:16:45.650" end="00:16:50.200">we instantiate an object of the why phonetics service advertiser class we...in the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:50.200" end="00:16:56.200">service name as a parameter to this classes constructor next we assign a</p>
      <p begin="00:16:56.200" end="00:17:01.120">call back to the session requested even turn that on the advertiser which gets fired whenever a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:01.120" end="00:17:05.700">secret tries to connect to your service the final step in publishing...service is to</p>
      <p begin="00:17:05.700" end="00:17:10.420">call start on the advertiser that's it you now have a service ready for excepting incoming</p>
      <p begin="00:17:10.420" end="00:17:15.330">connection requests from other seekers so if I was writing a game this is what I would</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.330" end="00:17:19.290">do in the game lobby like if I'm waiting for other people I want them to know that</p>
      <p begin="00:17:19.290" end="00:17:21.920">my game is running instead of the service name like ever</p>
      <p begin="00:17:21.920" end="00:17:26.380">fill that variable up with the content also dot game and everybody else running</p>
      <p begin="00:17:26.380" end="00:17:33.490">the game confinement correct let's take a look at what it takes to start a secret.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:33.490" end="00:17:37.130">To connect to a service the service needs to be discovered for us</p>
      <p begin="00:17:37.130" end="00:17:41.380">to discover service we need to create a query string with that particular service</p>
      <p begin="00:17:41.380" end="00:17:45.030">...that can be done by calling the get selector method on the y</p>

      <p begin="00:18:51.720" end="00:18:56.190">to accept incoming connection requests from other seekers so we had assigned</p>

      <p begin="00:19:36.440" end="00:19:39.720">api right you have to basic rules for</p>
      <p begin="00:19:39.720" end="00:19:44.720">the fundamental thing is you have one-sided trying to be discoverable the other</p>
      <p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:50.200">...other site trying to find it you make yourself discoverable and then you wait for incoming</p>
      <p begin="00:19:50.200" end="00:19:55.110">connections that's one role and the other role is you find people who are already discoverable</p>
      <p begin="00:19:55.110" end="00:19:59.640">and connect to it and what we have demonstrated is both sides of the role if you</p>
      <p begin="00:19:59.640" end="00:20:03.810">were working with one windows pc and something else you only need to</p>
      <p begin="00:20:03.810" end="00:20:09.970">implement one side of this roleso, we walked through the code let's talk about,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:09.970" end="00:20:14.170">you know, as people start building these applications water some interesting pips</p>
      <p begin="00:20:14.170" end="00:20:19.440">...tricks that people could follow there are two things that we would advice the first one</p>
      <p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:24.170">windows works under diversity of pc's they work on or pc's they work on new pc's the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:24.170" end="00:20:26.340">...pc's with hardware that has</p>
      <p begin="00:20:26.340" end="00:20:30.390">...wi-fi and others that don't so the first thing that you want to do before you</p>
      <p begin="00:20:30.390" end="00:20:35.240">start building applications you want to make sure that your pc actually supports this capability and</p>
      <p begin="00:20:35.240" end="00:20:39.700">...stand we've added a combined I'm not going to read the whole thing but you can run that command</p>
      <p begin="00:20:39.700" end="00:20:43.450">on your pc and you can see if wi-fi direct and services are</p>
      <p begin="00:20:43.450" end="00:20:48.430">supported you'd see and output like we show here the second thing if you're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:20:48.430" end="00:20:53.290">be working with devices and if you're not able to get connections through or of their failing</p>

      <p begin="00:20:57.910" end="00:21:02.760">over-the-air so, you know, packets coming out of this pc how do they look over-the-air and how</p>
