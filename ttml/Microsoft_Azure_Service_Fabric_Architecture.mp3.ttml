      <p begin="00:00:08.710" end="00:00:15.620">...gopal...why I'm a corporate vice president of microsoft today I'm really</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.620" end="00:00:21.580">excited to talk to you guys abode the service fabric and its architecture for a</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.580" end="00:00:24.650">great part of my creative microsoft I've been working on this technology</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.070" end="00:00:30.350">...lead the conception incubation realization and the product position</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.350" end="00:00:34.590">of this technology we initially build this technology for use by or first</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.590" end="00:00:38.940">...services as...first by...of uses became successful be</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.940" end="00:00:42.980">...it's a good idea for to make it available to external</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.980" end="00:00:46.550">...as...and that actually brings us to this day where we...announcing</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.550" end="00:00:52.200">the job and availability of this technology when we actually started working on this</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.200" end="00:00:54.250">...that many of for first...for</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.250" end="00:01:00.060">reese's for repeatedly solving the same pod distributed systems problems and,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.060" end="00:01:04.950">they in the process I think there was not only a bunch of needless</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.950" end="00:01:10.210">...was getting done but also that in the bugs are stuff that was done in</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.210" end="00:01:15.100">once of resource not getting leverage and of the service so we realized that we have an opportunity to</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.100" end="00:01:19.710">...foundation of distributed systems platform on which many of the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.710" end="00:01:25.320">...services could build...that the...low-rate and build and that's all</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.340" end="00:01:30.090">...this technology?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.090" end="00:01:33.860">This technology now I think is being made available to a</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.860" end="00:01:37.950">and third parties ...you know, this and stiki that is available if you go to the download</p>
      <p begin="00:01:37.950" end="00:01:42.200">...you can actually download the sdk you can you know, create the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.200" end="00:01:48.530">service fabric obligations ...scale minimized a single box</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.530" end="00:01:53.270">setup you can take those same applications that you actually develop on your box</p>
      <p begin="00:01:53.270" end="00:01:59.110">and, move them to run as these in...when we actually offer this as a hosted</p>
      <p begin="00:01:59.110" end="00:02:04.430">...offering and measure and couple of months you can also take the same obligations are</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.430" end="00:02:08.470">you're running a and move them on premises because we're going to ship this technology and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.470" end="00:02:13.070">upcoming release of ...and sixteen so,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.070" end="00:02:17.040">this is I mean this is a great moment and,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:20.360">how also one of my colleagues and teammate who's actually go would,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.360" end="00:02:24.050">come on,...come up and then do so presentations site</p>
      <p begin="00:02:24.050" end="00:02:28.960">...us to do some demos us they come up and here is</p>
      <p begin="00:02:28.960" end="00:02:30.950">the valuation slide?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:30.950" end="00:02:36.740">What is...of my talk usually going to talk about how the application development</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.740" end="00:02:42.400">...the glowed...and, how...service fabric actually helps you build</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.400" end="00:02:45.710">...native applications based on the microsoft...architecture</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.840" end="00:02:51.220">...it and I'm going to talk briefly...how you can build scalable reliable and easily</p>
      <p begin="00:02:51.220" end="00:02:56.740">manage microsoft uses using service fabric talk a little bit about you</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.740" end="00:02:59.770">...the system has been put together I...be kind of the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.770" end="00:03:04.680">...little bit...I'll tell you...the...subsystems which are internally running within...service</p>
      <p begin="00:03:04.680" end="00:03:08.870">...cluster and how they come together nicely to solve</p>
      <p begin="00:03:08.870" end="00:03:11.870">...distributed systems problems so that</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.870" end="00:03:16.690">...can focus on the of the...logic and sort of...you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:16.690" end="00:03:23.180">platform aspects and I will...summarize...the...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23.180" end="00:03:29.560">If not long ago ...for me it was true for many of my colleagues like, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29.560" end="00:03:34.760">sequels or guys...I also worked...work in a your but it was</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.760" end="00:03:39.690">not long ago the interviewer actually happily developing a bunch of features we would</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.690" end="00:03:44.500">should these features every two years in a box product and then cycle used to big and what that</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.500" end="00:03:48.740">...with...rental...cloud because now not only are required invited school without</p>
      <p begin="00:03:48.740" end="00:03:51.590">...developers today we are required to not only did</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.590" end="00:03:56.560">...features but also we have to take...off a whole bunch of stuff on that identified of this...like you have to think</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:01.700">...how do you billy also be useful...always the scalable from the sdp from the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:01.700" end="00:04:06.690">get-go how do you actually solve and make sure that the...remains available</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.690" end="00:04:13.180">even in the presence of machine previews...for more importantly when you're patching that service?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.180" end="00:04:18.100">How you actually think aboard how to build?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.100" end="00:04:22.540">How do build scalable...do ...low latency</p>
      <p begin="00:04:22.540" end="00:04:27.640">high throughput applications and all of these problem and think about data...data</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.640" end="00:04:33.150">...up you have to think about all these problems and, unfortunately you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33.150" end="00:04:37.630">if you start with the bid michael machines these problems of right in-your-face</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.630" end="00:04:41.550">so, what do not be nice for a platform to actually help you with solving</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.550" end="00:04:45.420">these problems so that we all can go to get back to actually developing features are</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.420" end="00:04:50.590">service specific logic that at a faster pace and help...the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:50.590" end="00:04:56.820">...julia's and provide business value?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.820" end="00:04:58.290">The globe.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:58.290" end="00:05:02.570">Another thing that's actually changed for us is the flagged you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:02.570" end="00:05:07.420">the architecture that via so used to in the past is not the architecture that you use for building</p>
      <p begin="00:05:07.420" end="00:05:12.690">flowed native applications if you actually go and pecan to meet any of our workloads like</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12.690" end="00:05:17.360">...br...bb ...on you actually see that they're not actually built in a tiered</p>
      <p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:22.450">we at all they're built...different way and the advantage of actually</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.450" end="00:05:26.380">building and adhered we are disadvantages you actually think...is that,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.380" end="00:05:31.380">you know, you had you know, you could build all of these things...would put all of them in</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31.380" end="00:05:36.110">...sort of machines and you actually depended on machines to provide the liability you typically random</p>
      <p begin="00:05:36.110" end="00:05:40.750">on begun machinesyou actually could afford to take some</p>
      <p begin="00:05:40.750" end="00:05:45.530">maintenance windows maybe order beak and where you could actually...on all the pieces of the software and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.530" end="00:05:50.060">...them up and get them ready for the following monday but in the code world it's</p>
      <p begin="00:05:50.060" end="00:05:54.370">not it's no longer that's not something that you can do because if you do that your customers will</p>
      <p begin="00:05:54.370" end="00:05:56.090">...free from your business</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56.090" end="00:06:00.720">are from your service so it is important for you to really think about the right-hand side of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.720" end="00:06:05.880">this slide unfortunately so,...you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.880" end="00:06:10.610">...start you build in a different way so that you can you get the benefits of that</p>
      <p begin="00:06:10.610" end="00:06:14.410">and side by building on top of a platform and the way you actually think we're building</p>
      <p begin="00:06:14.410" end="00:06:17.130">polled native apps in the modern base-two really</p>
      <p begin="00:06:17.130" end="00:06:23.090">decompose the service components I into a lose me</p>
      <p begin="00:06:23.090" end="00:06:28.160">a lou's be...in...interactive or standard protocol micro services</p>
      <p begin="00:06:28.160" end="00:06:30.900">and again in a would it would be great if,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:30.900" end="00:06:40.350">... the platform actually help you without and that's exactly where...fabric comes n?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:40.350" end="00:06:45.460">So, when you areinvite this is true for us this is going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.460" end="00:06:51.750">true for everybody who's thinking able buildinghigh skills are reese's when you're building a high</p>
      <p begin="00:06:51.750" end="00:06:55.390">...you really need to think deeply able to scale reliability</p>
      <p begin="00:06:55.390" end="00:07:00.520">and cost it is important that you design for scale from the get goals so you</p>
      <p begin="00:07:00.520" end="00:07:05.270">want because the demand for your service is going to be variable...start off small and suddenly</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.270" end="00:07:10.120">...you know, pick up steam and then become very popular so you want to really design your</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.120" end="00:07:13.940">...such that you can run on a small...and to a large</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.940" end="00:07:17.940">...without actually you have to heavy having you go back and revisit</p>
      <p begin="00:07:17.940" end="00:07:22.210">the architecture rebuild the service from scratch again so how do you do that I</p>
      <p begin="00:07:22.210" end="00:07:27.080">think is something that you have to pay attention...at the beginning and not think about it as an afterthought after the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:27.080" end="00:07:32.010">...being...deployed you also have to think aboard reliability, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:32.010" end="00:07:36.480">you really want to keep your service up and running you can't afford to have any maintenance windows</p>
      <p begin="00:07:36.480" end="00:07:41.590">you really how to keep the service available even in the presence of failure</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.590" end="00:07:46.480">machine problem in the presence of machine failures but also when you're doing...patching of</p>
      <p begin="00:07:46.480" end="00:07:50.920">the service an obvious whipping cost is very important again,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:50.920" end="00:07:55.620">you know, as via is developers not long ago we thought ...developing code and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:55.620" end="00:08:00.240">...features but that's no longer true because every...every piece of code that you</p>
      <p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:04.300">ride if it is more expensive to run that piece of code</p>
      <p begin="00:08:04.300" end="00:08:08.330">...doing a good job so again you really need to think about how we can use</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08.330" end="00:08:11.370">smart software on top of commodity hardware as opposed</p>
      <p begin="00:08:11.370" end="00:08:16.370">to...hardware on top of a...machines to actually</p>
      <p begin="00:08:16.370" end="00:08:20.350">...what...elaborately and scalability at the best</p>
      <p begin="00:08:20.350" end="00:08:24.860">a economical value and these are the problems</p>
      <p begin="00:08:24.860" end="00:08:27.780">dot vr for squad use of feast and</p>
      <p begin="00:08:27.780" end="00:08:32.180">...be delivered a bunch of technologies for these people and that's where service</p>
      <p begin="00:08:32.180" end="00:08:36.170">public came in and it actually I'm going to talk a little bit about some of the features</p>
      <p begin="00:08:36.170" end="00:08:40.330">that's obvious fabric provides but...for building a</p>
      <p begin="00:08:40.330" end="00:08:45.030">...used for doing the heavy lifting that is necessary for you to really build your services so that</p>
      <p begin="00:08:45.030" end="00:08:50.050">they are from get goal in a scalable reliable and run at the best</p>
      <p begin="00:08:50.050" end="00:08:52.680">prize that you can think of because</p>
      <p begin="00:08:52.680" end="00:08:58.710">...of the things that we actually take pride in this particular system is that we have shaved</p>
      <p begin="00:08:58.710" end="00:09:04.270">every possible I...every possible message in the system from so, that, you know, you get the best</p>
      <p begin="00:09:04.270" end="00:09:09.390">cannot best price obviously, you know, if you build on top of this service you know, we are</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.390" end="00:09:15.170">shipping on windows today you can actually use seep cplus-plus of csharp apis</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.170" end="00:09:20.210">we're going to make this technology available online...and, you can and,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:20.210" end="00:09:25.370">also expose them while they're programming models like java javascript so that,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:25.370" end="00:09:30.180">you know, you have the choice of actually on running on the platform of your choice</p>
      <p begin="00:09:30.180" end="00:09:34.340">of ways of your choice and you can also deployed?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:34.340" end="00:09:38.130">On...your are on premises...third-party</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.130" end="00:09:42.810">uploads so by actually running on top of this platform you are, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:42.810" end="00:09:51.000">you have some choice in...you want to deploy your app or your service.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:51.000" end="00:09:55.800">This particle slightly showing the number offor spotty services that are running on top</p>
      <p begin="00:09:55.800" end="00:10:01.020">of leisure on...service fabric it is not that we, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:01.020" end="00:10:04.270">be conceived this technology are we build this technology last year and</p>
      <p begin="00:10:04.270" end="00:10:08.870">they're giving you this technology this year we have I mean this</p>
      <p begin="00:10:08.870" end="00:10:12.070">...more than a decade ago on this has been running and</p>
      <p begin="00:10:12.070" end="00:10:18.260">...all of these services for the last five years more importantly</p>
      <p begin="00:10:18.260" end="00:10:23.620">we're not actually we are giving you the exact same bits that are and</p>
      <p begin="00:10:23.620" end="00:10:30.190">...so reese's in this sdk I'll talk about where it is different in a minute</p>
      <p begin="00:10:30.190" end="00:10:34.560">...are not giving you a different washroom... less functional washroom</p>
      <p begin="00:10:35.950" end="00:10:40.820">...diff and a call-in different copy of...core br...you guys you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:40.820" end="00:10:47.770">...bunch of visual infrastructure itself runs on top of thisif</p>

      <p begin="00:17:04.610" end="00:17:09.560">build stateless services but who's going to solve the stateful, stateful problem obviously I think</p>

      <p begin="00:17:15.030" end="00:17:20.900">be solved by us because we are the people who are actually supporting the database technology videos stateful</p>
      <p begin="00:17:20.900" end="00:17:24.990">at the core so for stateful microsoft...on the other hand, you know,</p>

      <p begin="00:17:30.070" end="00:17:35.200">...you cannot afford to lose that state ...has to be a kernel of truth somewhere because if everything in the</p>

      <p begin="00:17:40.740" end="00:17:43.040">...laying...somewhere so who's maintaining that</p>
      <p begin="00:17:43.040" end="00:17:47.040">...that's where the stateful microsoft resource actually come into play and the way you</p>
      <p begin="00:17:47.040" end="00:17:51.410">actually achieved reliability for state for microsoft resources by maintaining and copies of that</p>
      <p begin="00:17:51.410" end="00:17:54.670">...obviously you want to maintain those and copies of the state</p>
      <p begin="00:17:54.670" end="00:17:58.850">and a consistent manner because you really have to think about how your updating</p>
      <p begin="00:17:58.850" end="00:18:03.500">...mutating that...and the system has to give you those guarantees that the and copies of</p>

      <p begin="00:18:04.810" end="00:18:11.750">...indeed consistent...you be attribute I'll talk a little bit about how we achieve that consistency?</p>
      <p begin="00:18:11.750" end="00:18:18.350">And, you know, example stateful microsoft...are...or databases and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:18.350" end="00:18:20.930">documents and, you know, user state user...tools</p>
      <p begin="00:18:20.930" end="00:18:26.690">on other things so with that in mind I'm going to invite my friend my teammate to,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:26.690" end="00:18:30.950">come on, board and actually talk...statefull stateless michael service because I'm now</p>
      <p begin="00:18:30.950" end="00:18:34.710">...guys on a journey of making the sys...the system</p>
      <p begin="00:18:34.710" end="00:18:40.470">starts with a simple thing and how it becomes complex as you go down ...on the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:40.470" end="00:18:45.200">...on the path in this particular case...stateless microsoft ways it's nothing</p>
      <p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:50.230">but a visual object we just really moving in space it does have state and,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:50.230" end="00:18:58.320">that's date...is a location eighties and, the past ten locations baited had</p>
      <p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:02.870">beam and we will show you how that state ...state stables microsoft reese's</p>
      <p begin="00:19:02.870" end="00:19:16.710">and other shoulder-to-shoulder running I really do some failures and see...it goes?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:16.710" end="00:19:21.060">What we want so, here's an example of a stateless</p>
      <p begin="00:19:21.060" end="00:19:26.070">micros service in this case the micro services an object floating around in this</p>
      <p begin="00:19:26.070" end="00:19:31.760">space this state of the art is represented by the current position as well</p>
      <p begin="00:19:31.760" end="00:19:38.940">as the history which is represented by...the tail saw here is a</p>
      <p begin="00:19:38.940" end="00:19:43.240">...explorer this is a tool that we offer as part of the sdk which allows you to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:43.240" end="00:19:48.740">visualized manage and monitor your cluster so,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:48.740" end="00:19:52.140">what I'm going to do is that here I have that</p>
      <p begin="00:19:52.140" end="00:19:57.830">service which is the stateless service that stateless service</p>
      <p begin="00:19:57.830" end="00:20:01.880">has one instance and it is running on node three as you can see here</p>
      <p begin="00:20:02.990" end="00:20:09.250">some more input this to auto refresh so we have one instance of that service running on</p>
      <p begin="00:20:09.250" end="00:20:17.120">node three and what I'm going to do is basically restart node three?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:17.120" end="00:20:21.830">So,...what happens to the instance</p>
      <p begin="00:20:21.830" end="00:20:25.850">that is here as well as the object so,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:25.850" end="00:20:27.760">as you can see that.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:27.760" end="00:20:31.920">The as a so in this particular case actually what ripple data is</p>
      <p begin="00:20:31.920" end="00:20:36.630">...just to give a machine think of it like that and that machine on a</p>

      <p begin="00:20:52.970" end="00:20:55.840">...see it, come on, you can see that it actually came</p>
      <p begin="00:20:55.840" end="00:21:01.770">back but unfortunately I had to put on my glasses because I'm getting old.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:01.770" end="00:21:06.480">The what I think maybe you guys didn't notice is that when it actually started on</p>
      <p begin="00:21:06.480" end="00:21:11.550">a machine this particular microsoft has lost its state embossed</p>
      <p begin="00:21:11.550" end="00:21:17.060">...position it had been and, the last and positions...being in so don't actually went back to some,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:17.060" end="00:21:22.930">you know, of the position rated actually to apply for to...because...</p>
      <p begin="00:21:23.960" end="00:21:27.180">Because.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:27.180" end="00:21:36.660">...go back to my slides.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:36.660" end="00:21:40.670">But, the system did solve the problem of detecting that the machine has gone</p>
      <p begin="00:21:40.670" end="00:21:43.320">...and actually figuring out a particular instance of a</p>

      <p begin="00:21:47.550" end="00:21:52.010">that's where the failure detection problem for the system can't even for stateless microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:21:52.010" end="00:21:56.100">...which we think are the easy ones compared to the stateful ones</p>
      <p begin="00:21:56.100" end="00:22:02.080">there is a hard distributed systems problem which is a failure detection problem and that's what you know,</p>

      <p begin="00:56:09.600" end="00:56:11.220">You know, this is what is happening in the</p>
      <p begin="00:56:11.220" end="00:56:16.930">system you have a as a package which is already running if...</p>
      <p begin="00:56:16.930" end="00:56:21.570">is already running and we want to sorry?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:21.570" end="00:56:24.460">So, this was this is the my...of microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:56:24.460" end="00:56:29.440">is running on the system and we decided to convert the yellow one from</p>
      <p begin="00:56:29.440" end="00:56:34.330">...blue one which is...and now we want to...what the system is does is it</p>
      <p begin="00:56:34.330" end="00:56:39.260">goes and carefully orchestrated upgrading each of those yellow one without actually</p>
      <p begin="00:56:39.260" end="00:56:44.220">...losing availability always maintaining core alms so all the time the rights are going</p>
      <p begin="00:56:44.220" end="00:56:48.460">through and the system...up all the time and,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:48.460" end="00:57:01.060">it also monitors all these...so that if anything goes bad...back.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:01.060" end="00:57:06.430">They, yeah, so.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:06.430" end="00:57:10.510">So, now you can see that...some of these objects are rotating you can see that one of them is</p>
      <p begin="00:57:10.510" end="00:57:16.360">actually rotating if you can see that as update is going through obviously these</p>
      <p begin="00:57:16.360" end="00:57:22.130">update your be very careful...these are not willy-nilly...create and instances</p>
      <p begin="00:57:22.130" end="00:57:25.950">...I can do that very easily...stateless I can easily created liked</p>
      <p begin="00:57:25.950" end="00:57:30.700">hundreds of instances when you're dealing with statefull staff you really have to make sure</p>
      <p begin="00:57:30.700" end="00:57:35.410">...there in some cases obviously these objects are simple objects but in some cases like databases</p>
      <p begin="00:57:35.410" end="00:57:40.190">your gigabytes of speed you really need to think of old how you carefully</p>
      <p begin="00:57:40.190" end="00:57:46.020">orchestrate these things so that you never lose availability this is not in a real-world you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:46.020" end="00:57:50.550">you this stateful objects are very complex objects and they have lots of state</p>
      <p begin="00:57:50.550" end="00:57:57.320">it's not a demo thing that I can go...has been of like hundred instances...instances you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:57.320" end="00:58:02.510">when the system is balancing them it's actually doing it very carefully we told you actually losing</p>
      <p begin="00:58:02.510" end="00:58:07.180">availability, you know, but, I...I'm doing upgraded it's not that the most important thing for</p>
      <p begin="00:58:07.180" end="00:58:11.700">me use forty-two really complete and I want to completed in an automatic way...told me...</p>
      <p begin="00:58:11.700" end="00:58:16.500">holding it but I want to do it in a very easy way so now you can see that</p>
      <p begin="00:58:16.500" end="00:58:18.120">this...the cost update</p>
      <p begin="00:58:18.120" end="00:58:23.100">is going through and it bringing on more and more the thing what are the last ud and,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:23.100" end="00:58:28.610">you can see that it's got remember I told you how it's going...time or update domain at a time</p>
      <p begin="00:58:28.610" end="00:58:33.630">...failure domain you can see that it's computed...one...and then it's actually and,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:33.630" end="00:58:38.770">I'll actually it's done is that...so</p>
      <p begin="00:58:40.090" end="00:58:47.750">yeah, it's completed so now you would see that all of them are actually rotating?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:47.750" end="00:58:54.970">So, this is what we are build the system and, there's one other thing which.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:54.970" end="00:58:59.480">I want to talk abode which is the test ability all of this is wonderful but,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:59.480" end="00:59:02.130">you know, that...will always of bugs</p>
      <p begin="00:59:02.130" end="00:59:06.510">...you write code you want to have some amount of failures</p>
      <p begin="00:59:06.510" end="00:59:11.170">happening in the system all the time and you can actually dial-up or dialed</p>
      <p begin="00:59:11.170" end="00:59:15.530">...those the rate of those failure so the system actually comes with the prebuilt</p>
      <p begin="00:59:15.530" end="00:59:18.210">cure-all service which is actually</p>
      <p begin="00:59:18.210" end="00:59:21.880">...own and killing processes killing machines</p>
      <p begin="00:59:21.880" end="00:59:27.080">...machines all...very bad things and...dial on a variety of</p>
      <p begin="00:59:27.080" end="00:59:31.250">...disease-causing and you can dial them up...them...and</p>
      <p begin="00:59:31.250" end="00:59:36.420">ensure that you know, your services running bug free most of the time so this is all you</p>
      <p begin="00:59:36.420" end="00:59:41.580">vetoed the bugs before, you know,...hate your customers...there will be some bugs that will be</p>
      <p begin="00:59:41.580" end="00:59:46.640">there and production systems but hopefully by the time it hits the production your</p>
      <p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:50.970">redid or most of the bug and you also have the key also is running in your production system so that</p>
      <p begin="00:59:50.970" end="00:59:53.310">...reading...bug as the appear you rather</p>
      <p begin="00:59:53.310" end="00:59:57.780">...them sooner than later so you can actually deployed the service on by the way</p>
      <p begin="00:59:57.780" end="01:00:02.300">...lowered also uses...and you can actually go and</p>
      <p begin="01:00:02.300" end="01:00:05.760">deploy and in this particular slide you can see that...stability</p>
      <p begin="01:00:05.760" end="01:00:11.190">use actually causing a bunch of failure modes and as those failures are happening</p>
      <p begin="01:00:11.190" end="01:00:19.060">...let me see what had to put all my glasses the problem of for...</p>
      <p begin="01:00:19.060" end="01:00:23.760">The agency...activated code packages it is killing machines that clearly it's</p>
      <p begin="01:00:23.760" end="01:00:28.330">...processes and then as it's doing its job you know,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:28.330" end="01:00:33.080">the cluster in the cluster visualize...what's happening in the system so</p>
      <p begin="01:00:33.080" end="01:00:37.210">again the system comes with a bunch of prebuilt services you can choose to build in</p>
      <p begin="01:00:37.210" end="01:00:44.550">a deploy them like you...this putting together looks like...and...and then the system continues to operate.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:44.550" end="01:00:47.400">That brings me to.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:47.400" end="01:00:52.580">And, obviously there's a lot more interesting stuff here.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:53.680" end="01:00:59.940">You know, brings me to look and of my talk you know, this.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:59.940" end="01:01:03.500">We built this service ...that we build this</p>
      <p begin="01:01:03.500" end="01:01:08.950">platform this distributed systems platform primarily for force parties ...us</p>
      <p begin="01:01:08.950" end="01:01:13.940">parties you use a bunch of low-level apis in our system.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:13.940" end="01:01:18.740">We realize that, you know, some of those aps most of them are native apis...have a bunch of</p>
      <p begin="01:01:18.740" end="01:01:23.130">...more...a bunch of code in the system if you actually downloadable installed a bunch of</p>
      <p begin="01:01:23.130" end="01:01:29.350">...as well so the amount of code that these guys...using the aps...but using</p>
      <p begin="01:01:29.350" end="01:01:34.320">the low-level apis we thought that we actually in order to make the system more approachable we started working</p>
      <p begin="01:01:34.320" end="01:01:39.070">...a year-ago building higher-level programming models and higher-level apis on</p>
      <p begin="01:01:39.070" end="01:01:40.460">...the system.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:40.460" end="01:01:44.590">The core has been bigger long long-time but the stuff that viet building on</p>
      <p begin="01:01:44.590" end="01:01:46.570">top these approachable programming models</p>
      <p begin="01:01:46.570" end="01:01:52.010">are approachable apis and the visual studio integration you still...maybe some</p>
      <p begin="01:01:52.010" end="01:01:56.960">rough edges that you guys will encounter as you guys are using but we are going to fix all of them and,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:56.960" end="01:02:00.360">you know, and, the qualities bait so it is all this, you know,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:00.360" end="01:02:03.640">higher-level little things or these this parameter name dried</p>
      <p begin="01:02:03.640" end="01:02:07.620">...confusing or did actually do that I'd thing and maybe there's a bug</p>
      <p begin="01:02:07.620" end="01:02:11.970">...also so the key is that we big the core we're giving you</p>
      <p begin="01:02:11.970" end="01:02:16.110">theaccess to these tobits with the much...more approachable</p>
      <p begin="01:02:16.110" end="01:02:20.450">...programming model as well as tooling integrations where you may see some</p>
      <p begin="01:02:20.450" end="01:02:24.810">...ridges but, you know, if you guys user providers feedback via</p>
      <p begin="01:02:24.810" end="01:02:28.890">our and we are going to ship this even on a weekly with them</p>
      <p begin="01:02:28.890" end="01:02:34.700">and we will want to take you guys to production by the end of this year if plausible so,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:34.700" end="01:02:39.370">please go download the...bill apps on top of this and,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:39.370" end="01:02:42.880">give us feedback and that will help us make the system better?</p>
