      <p begin="00:00:06.920" end="00:00:08.980">All right everybody welcome.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.980" end="00:00:14.780">Welcome to build twenty fifteen what's going to get started on the session here.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.780" end="00:00:19.540">my name is tony penalty now I'm a program manager on the operating systems</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.540" end="00:00:22.290">...microsoft and with me today is going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.290" end="00:00:26.570">adam wilson who's going to be helping out with some of the demos.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.570" end="00:00:30.380">We're talking about in today's session is user data, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.380" end="00:00:34.860">it's good to get an idea from the audience about like how you know-how informed you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.860" end="00:00:36.410">are on this stuff how a useful</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.410" end="00:00:42.630">this is to-you so let's go and get a show of hands-on who uses contacts.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.630" end="00:00:46.430">Okay, how about text messages and phone calls anybody</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.430" end="00:00:49.350">...email and calendar okay,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.350" end="00:00:52.940">so, it sounds like this is going to be relevant to you guys so hopefully we got some very</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.940" end="00:01:00.720">interesting things that are going to enable you to do some really cool things on the universal windows platform?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.720" end="00:01:06.260">Just a reminder at the end of the session we're going to be having a evaluation thing so,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.260" end="00:01:12.960">I'll ask you that the...fill that out and one last thing to look at before we really dive into this is the application</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:17.430">model map you may have seen this already and andrew clinics or one of the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.430" end="00:01:22.150">other talks that have already happen but my team is the application model</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.150" end="00:01:25.030">on for windows universal apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.030" end="00:01:29.740">And, what this means is where the team that's responsible for the execution environment and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.740" end="00:01:32.190">deployments so, a lot of the basic</p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.190" end="00:01:37.750">wghooks for apps so what you're in right now is the user data section?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:37.750" end="00:01:42.090">You'll have the chance after this one to go to the store and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.090" end="00:01:46.730">deployment sections or tomorrow you can catch the app section or</p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.730" end="00:01:54.110">...services section later in the day tomorrow.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.110" end="00:01:59.090">User data so key to so many experiences across modern devices and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:59.090" end="00:02:03.540">when I'm talking about user data today what I'm specifically talking about</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.540" end="00:02:05.570">are the data types of appointments?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:06.710" end="00:02:07.920">Contacts</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:11.880">email text messages calls.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.880" end="00:02:15.810">And, user data accounts what we mean by user data accounts are basically like</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.810" end="00:02:21.950">email accounts away to grouped together so several of the different data types.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:21.950" end="00:02:25.570">Everything that I'm talking about today is going to be available on the universal windows</p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.570" end="00:02:30.320">platform in fact most of it is already available and will be showing you on the tools that you</p>
      <p begin="00:02:30.320" end="00:02:34.670">had a made available for download yesterday afternoon?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.670" end="00:02:39.360">A few the cases will only work on the windows ten mobile but that's the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:46.840">case of like text messages and phone calls which are only support on mobile devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.840" end="00:02:50.830">When we built these though we expanded what you had available to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:50.830" end="00:02:54.530">you and windows phone store a point one apps?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:54.530" end="00:02:57.010">Everything that was available for windows phone store a</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.010" end="00:03:00.490">point one apps is now available on the universal windows platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.510" end="00:03:04.490">Everything that was available in the windows store eight-point one apps</p>
      <p begin="00:03:04.490" end="00:03:12.100">is now available for the universal windows platform and we've added so much more.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.100" end="00:03:16.240">One of our goals in this release was to make sure that are great first party</p>
      <p begin="00:03:16.240" end="00:03:21.130">experiences that ship with windows in-box things like the people hub outlook</p>
      <p begin="00:03:21.130" end="00:03:25.000">mail-in calendar the messaging app the phone dialing out core</p>
      <p begin="00:03:25.000" end="00:03:29.440">tunnel all of these apps rely so heavily on user data in order to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:32.700">enable experiences for the end-user and they're built on</p>
      <p begin="00:03:32.700" end="00:03:39.910">these same api that I'm going to be talking about today.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.910" end="00:03:44.050">So, the types of scenarios that we're trying to enable.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.050" end="00:03:47.160">This falls into sort of three buckets although these are going to be pretty</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47.160" end="00:03:52.130">loose user data is a huge broad area and all kinds of things can be enabled here</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52.130" end="00:03:56.990">but we want to make search possible to provide core functionality those are</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.990" end="00:04:01.080">things like contact applications messaging applications</p>
      <p begin="00:04:01.080" end="00:04:06.120">email calendar and dollar applications as I just mentioned we built the first</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.120" end="00:04:09.970">part experiences outlook mail-in calendar which you've seen all these previews</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.970" end="00:04:17.130">in the key notes today and yesterday those are built on the same api that I'm talking about here.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:17.130" end="00:04:20.250">We want to make a possible for-you to expand networks and your application.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21.580" end="00:04:23.640">...scenario and that cases to read the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.640" end="00:04:28.310">users contact data and figure out which people the user knows about</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.310" end="00:04:33.280">the you already know about your service this allows you to provide instant gratification when</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33.280" end="00:04:37.260">a user downloads and installs your application saying hey I already know about so-and-so</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.260" end="00:04:44.570">you want to messages person voip this person whatever it is</p>
      <p begin="00:04:44.570" end="00:04:51.690">Who knows we want to make it super easy to initiate communication from your applications even if you're not one of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.690" end="00:04:55.680">these core experiences so we have a bunch of what we call tasks api</p>
      <p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:05:00.290">is that allow you to quickly get some sort of task accomplish things like sending</p>
      <p begin="00:05:00.290" end="00:05:04.620">...sms sending e-mail adding appointments etc?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:04.620" end="00:05:09.240">We also want to make a possible for-you to add your network to the core experiences so this</p>
      <p begin="00:05:09.240" end="00:05:14.080">isn't just about reading user data but supplying user data as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:17.820">If you're application knows about contact data or appointment data we</p>
      <p begin="00:05:17.820" end="00:05:20.540">want-to make sure that you can write this into the system.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:20.540" end="00:05:24.420">And, the same place that any of the first party experiences are looking for that so</p>
      <p begin="00:05:24.420" end="00:05:29.330">that your application can show up across the windows ecosystem whether that is</p>
      <p begin="00:05:29.330" end="00:05:37.220">in those inbox experiences and other applications that are written value as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:37.220" end="00:05:42.110">Finally we...make sure it's possible to innovate and this is what I meant by this</p>
      <p begin="00:05:42.110" end="00:05:47.180">or just a broad term so what we mean by that these aren't just specific api</p>
      <p begin="00:05:47.180" end="00:05:52.120">that accomplish exact scenarios that we think that you want to do this is about enabling</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52.120" end="00:05:58.070">you to do things with this data there are thousands literally the over a thousand</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58.070" end="00:06:01.740">interfaces that we've introduced in these areas in order to accomplish.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:02.830" end="00:06:07.500">Everything that needs to be done around user data we hope.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.500" end="00:06:09.160">Instead of tying to specific use</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.160" end="00:06:13.630">cases and scenarios we allow make sure that we allow you to do things like build-up your</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.630" end="00:06:18.560">own data models to bring the data into your own system and keep up-to-date</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.560" end="00:06:23.400">with that data and we hope that this allows you to do innovative things</p>
      <p begin="00:06:23.400" end="00:06:28.450">in the same manner that outlook mail-in calendar has been able to the same manner that core</p>
      <p begin="00:06:28.450" end="00:06:32.990">...been able to an when it reads the data and actually makes a copy of some</p>
      <p begin="00:06:32.990" end="00:06:36.650">...data in order to do with speech engines.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.650" end="00:06:40.910">All of these things require the ability to keep up to date and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:40.910" end="00:06:45.280">...going through that in-depth today.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.280" end="00:06:49.100">So, that's a lot that's a lot of promise and that would be a so much to talk about</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.100" end="00:06:53.870">they said a thousand different interfaces I could rattle those often maybe finish...an hour</p>
      <p begin="00:06:53.870" end="00:06:57.770">so what we're going to do is we're going to focus instead on one specific data</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57.770" end="00:07:03.690">tight and that's going to be contacts we're going to walk through all the different features that we</p>
      <p begin="00:07:03.690" end="00:07:06.680">have enabled and the contact space which</p>
      <p begin="00:07:06.680" end="00:07:10.330">is a superset of the features for all the different areas.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:11.380" end="00:07:15.920">And, then we'll be sure to call out how these different feature sets apply to the other data types</p>
      <p begin="00:07:15.920" end="00:07:20.790">also so that, you know, when where you can also do the same thing for appointments or</p>
      <p begin="00:07:20.790" end="00:07:24.790">for...messages etc in order to demo this we built</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.790" end="00:07:31.240">two different demo apps that we're going to be showing off and...be helping with showing off today?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:31.240" end="00:07:37.100">One of those is a contact display application so in this case this is something</p>
      <p begin="00:07:37.100" end="00:07:42.080">that's reading the contacts database and...showing that information to the end-user like you see in</p>
      <p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:46.610">the screenshot here so basically just a list view and then when you tap on an individual</p>
      <p begin="00:07:46.610" end="00:07:50.190">contact you're going to additional profile information quite straightforward?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:51.450" end="00:07:54.560">The other application is going to be more of a</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:07:59.440">network provider simulator sounds fancy all that means is writing contact</p>
      <p begin="00:07:59.440" end="00:08:04.230">into the system that can be read by other applications and show up</p>
      <p begin="00:08:04.230" end="00:08:08.270">in all the other experiences that rely on contacts so that includes the people</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08.270" end="00:08:12.930">...outlook, outlook mail the messaging app</p>
      <p begin="00:08:12.930" end="00:08:18.810">...and all the other cases where we use this contact data across the system.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:18.810" end="00:08:21.550">Both of these are windows apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:21.550" end="00:08:26.210">They're both built on the universal windows platform which means that you</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.210" end="00:08:30.810">can build once and you can...run them across all the family of windows ten</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30.810" end="00:08:35.700">devices whether that's windows desktop and mobile today.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:35.700" end="00:08:41.980">Or soon xbox coyote and hollow...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:41.980" end="00:08:46.310">And, finally as I mentioned will be calling out the different features and.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:46.310" end="00:08:49.670">Let's get going and...the first feature area here.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.670" end="00:08:53.240">So, the tasks areas these are the ones that I mention are</p>
      <p begin="00:08:53.240" end="00:08:56.880">for let's say the more broad use case.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:00.780">These are for anybody that wants to interact with this data but does not want to build your own</p>
      <p begin="00:09:00.780" end="00:09:06.620">ui around it or deal with direct programmatic database access and</p>
      <p begin="00:09:06.620" end="00:09:10.920">these cases these are very scripted scenarios they allow you to do very specific</p>
      <p begin="00:09:10.920" end="00:09:15.700">things and we have several of these so I'm going to go a little bit quickly through these but I invite</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.700" end="00:09:18.690">you catch the talk from last year where I covered some of these more</p>
      <p begin="00:09:18.690" end="00:09:23.100">in-depth or there's a lot of these since they were available previously on windows phone</p>
      <p begin="00:09:23.100" end="00:09:26.460">eight-point one and for a subset of them windows eight-point one</p>
      <p begin="00:09:26.460" end="00:09:32.090">there is a lot of information already about out there are available...msdn another sources so for</p>
      <p begin="00:09:32.090" end="00:09:37.050">appointments we have six different tasks that we allow you to do we allow you to add a new</p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.050" end="00:09:41.310">appointment in this case what you do is you define a subject and details</p>
      <p begin="00:09:41.310" end="00:09:45.910">time duration and then you pass this into a single api call and then you</p>
      <p begin="00:09:45.910" end="00:09:51.870">...brought up by the outlook calendar app...the user can save...to a calendar or choose to cancel.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:51.870" end="00:09:54.290">Same idea with remove it shows the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:54.290" end="00:09:57.700">...and the user can choose to remove that particular point</p>
      <p begin="00:09:57.700" end="00:10:02.050">...cancel replacing replaces new</p>
      <p begin="00:10:02.050" end="00:10:08.080">is the same thing as ad but it allows the user to make changes before saving...the calendar.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:08.080" end="00:10:11.520">Details will show the actual appointment details</p>
      <p begin="00:10:11.520" end="00:10:15.900">for a particular appointment so this is going on to the page where</p>
      <p begin="00:10:15.900" end="00:10:18.390">then you can do things like the user can modify the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:18.390" end="00:10:22.440">appointment user can delete it from that page all kinds of things and finally we have the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:23.850" end="00:10:27.250">...frame allows you to say hey I want to present to the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:27.250" end="00:10:32.360">...calendar for this day this time and this allows you to do scenarios like if</p>
      <p begin="00:10:32.360" end="00:10:37.590">you're doing may be booking appoint booking tickets or for concerts or things like that it's</p>
      <p begin="00:10:37.590" end="00:10:44.790">great to be able to show the user their own calendar aso that they're able to find the time that's good for them.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:44.790" end="00:10:50.960">Next we have calls so this is another straightforward...the past on windows phone devices we've</p>
      <p begin="00:10:50.960" end="00:10:56.070">allowed you to initiate phone calls but there was an interstitial dialogue that said hey you want</p>
      <p begin="00:10:56.070" end="00:11:00.140">allow this app to make the calls that's no longer the case your now</p>
      <p begin="00:11:00.140" end="00:11:04.340">...to initiated phone call without a user prompt.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:04.340" end="00:11:07.770">And, were okay with this for the end-user because it does bring up first party</p>
      <p begin="00:11:07.770" end="00:11:12.110">...the...progress call dialogue will be the same one the users used to from whenever they may</p>
      <p begin="00:11:12.110" end="00:11:20.370">calls otherwise and it's a very straightforward easy api to use will be...you that one bit.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:20.370" end="00:11:24.470">Next there are contacts so we have three different tasks that you can enable for</p>
      <p begin="00:11:24.470" end="00:11:24.970">contacts.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:26.040" end="00:11:30.610">These three tasks...to bring up the profile card and you can bring that up based</p>
      <p begin="00:11:30.610" end="00:11:34.560">on data that you have whether that's an email dresser phone-number or even a contact</p>
      <p begin="00:11:34.560" end="00:11:39.490">id or you can build a profile car just from blank data that doesn't necessarily match with somebody in</p>
      <p begin="00:11:39.490" end="00:11:43.680">your the context database we have.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:43.680" end="00:11:45.970">The...contact card.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:45.970" end="00:11:49.830">This is something new that's available on windows ten desktop devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:50.970" end="00:11:55.280">So, there's many contact card is something that will show up across all different experiences</p>
      <p begin="00:11:55.280" end="00:11:58.960">...windows whether you're coming from outlook mail or from the</p>
      <p begin="00:11:58.960" end="00:12:05.000">messaging app or another other your applications calling them many contact card.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:05.000" end="00:12:07.820">This experience allows the user to easily</p>
      <p begin="00:12:07.820" end="00:12:10.200">initiate a communication mode modality</p>
      <p begin="00:12:10.200" end="00:12:14.930">...communication choice with a particular user a particular person in their</p>
      <p begin="00:12:14.930" end="00:12:18.580">contacts database and we can see on this as</p>
      <p begin="00:12:18.580" end="00:12:23.500">...lincoln xbox listed there so there's different choices you can half and those are actually</p>
      <p begin="00:12:23.500" end="00:12:27.090">different tabs too so that's for messaging...you see right there</p>
      <p begin="00:12:27.090" end="00:12:32.570">then those be able to make voice calls are video calls or sending e-mail messages a</p>
      <p begin="00:12:32.570" end="00:12:36.200">little bit later today I'm show you how to make it so that your application shows up</p>
      <p begin="00:12:36.200" end="00:12:41.780">there right alongside all the microsoft applications.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:41.780" end="00:12:43.070">Finally for contacts we have</p>
      <p begin="00:12:43.070" end="00:12:48.070">the contact picker this is a straightforward concept most people probably who are views the</p>
      <p begin="00:12:48.070" end="00:12:50.840">...before familiar with we bring up first are</p>
      <p begin="00:12:50.840" end="00:12:55.430">...users able to select one or more contacts and then they say</p>
      <p begin="00:12:55.430" end="00:12:58.420">okay we return back to your application and</p>
      <p begin="00:12:58.420" end="00:13:03.330">your application gets the contact information that the user out selected in order to use for really</p>
      <p begin="00:13:03.330" end="00:13:10.270">anything think invite scenarios is a very common situation for that.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:10.270" end="00:13:14.710">We have the email api so this was something that was introduced</p>
      <p begin="00:13:14.710" end="00:13:19.670">this particular email api was introduced in windows phone eight-point one it's the same one</p>
      <p begin="00:13:19.670" end="00:13:23.280">...you to send emails with attachments added to it</p>
      <p begin="00:13:23.280" end="00:13:30.570">and works again across the windows ten family of devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:30.570" end="00:13:32.510">Being able to...sms message</p>
      <p begin="00:13:32.510" end="00:13:37.300">...very common scenario for inviting people to like gaming situations you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:13:37.300" end="00:13:41.460">get additional users on your platform as a messes a great way to say hey</p>
      <p begin="00:13:41.460" end="00:13:47.120">go and buy one of your friends to come play this game with you or whatever you're trying to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:47.120" end="00:13:51.060">And, finally for user data accounts we have api that allow you to bring up the</p>
      <p begin="00:13:51.060" end="00:13:55.450">...ad account dialogue to fix accounts if you find that account is an error</p>
      <p begin="00:13:55.450" end="00:13:58.300">state or...the user whether not they want to</p>
      <p begin="00:13:58.300" end="00:14:02.790">delete an account so again I move through these pretty quick but they're not the core of the</p>
      <p begin="00:14:02.790" end="00:14:07.090">talk here today I do want to call out one more thing though at the bottom of each of these</p>
      <p begin="00:14:07.090" end="00:14:11.830">slides you see this table and this case this table applied to all the different tasks</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.830" end="00:14:16.120">slides but...going to be a single table for each of the next feature sets as we walk through</p>
      <p begin="00:14:16.120" end="00:14:20.730">on and what we mean here is that sense all the blocks and that table</p>
      <p begin="00:14:20.730" end="00:14:23.890">agreeing that means that those api...ready to go</p>
      <p begin="00:14:23.890" end="00:14:27.280">...available to you they don't require any sort of special permission</p>
      <p begin="00:14:27.280" end="00:14:30.750">or lockdown access for it they do require annals...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:30.750" end="00:14:36.660">of cases a security capability to be declared in order to notify the end-user that</p>
      <p begin="00:14:36.660" end="00:14:46.110">you're going to be accessing certain functionality but they're ready for you to...at any time?</p>
      <p begin="00:14:46.110" end="00:14:50.220">Ok, so, now let's get into the programmatic stuff this is where we start getting</p>
      <p begin="00:14:50.220" end="00:14:53.480">real fun stuff so the read api</p>
      <p begin="00:14:53.480" end="00:14:59.840">as these are the api is that allow you to query user data and</p>
      <p begin="00:14:59.840" end="00:15:04.660">read that into your application maybe that's for displaying the data and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:04.660" end="00:15:08.480">a custom ui here is a screen shot of the people</p>
      <p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:11.660">apple showing how is reading from the context database?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:13.410" end="00:15:18.260">But, it could also apply to other types of scenarios things like making the connections for the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:18.260" end="00:15:23.150">end-user figuring out whether or not you already know about the users contacts whether or not they're</p>
      <p begin="00:15:23.150" end="00:15:29.320">already present...the system in your system...so when it comes to reading appointments contacts and</p>
      <p begin="00:15:29.320" end="00:15:32.540">email data you have exchange active</p>
      <p begin="00:15:32.540" end="00:15:35.920">...data coming down you have card having held out data pop</p>
      <p begin="00:15:35.920" end="00:15:40.800">and imap or it can be data that's provided by other applications using the</p>
      <p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:44.810">right api which we'll get to and a few slides later for</p>
      <p begin="00:15:44.810" end="00:15:49.510">call history and text messages you're able to read the cellular...</p>
      <p begin="00:15:49.510" end="00:15:54.430">Data or again this can be app provided data that's coming from something like</p>
      <p begin="00:15:54.430" end="00:15:59.780">...which is writing call history entries into the database.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:59.780" end="00:16:03.950">These data models are very similar...relatively straightforward if you want</p>
      <p begin="00:16:03.950" end="00:16:08.840">to learn how to use one of on relatively straightforward to move to the other data types but</p>
      <p begin="00:16:08.840" end="00:16:13.350">...certainly optimized for each data type I mean is very there's a fundamental difference</p>
      <p begin="00:16:13.350" end="00:16:17.580">would be contacts you're going to read and a alphabetical order that</p>
      <p begin="00:16:17.580" end="00:16:21.550">sorted by the system whereas something like text messages you're going to want to get back</p>
      <p begin="00:16:21.550" end="00:16:26.310">...a more chronological order so what we think that...great.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:26.310" end="00:16:28.690">As easy-to-use as we can make it while still keeping</p>
      <p begin="00:16:28.690" end="00:16:32.350">...powerful api sets in order to accomplish these.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:32.350" end="00:16:36.860">So, now we have some yellow at the bottom of the table and we would like everything to be green let's get</p>
      <p begin="00:16:36.860" end="00:16:41.490">that straightforward our goal is to make as much green as possible but currently the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:41.490" end="00:16:45.890">calls and email api is require a special permission for the security</p>
      <p begin="00:16:45.890" end="00:16:50.800">capabilities for those so if you work with a microsoft partner</p>
      <p begin="00:16:50.800" end="00:16:56.120">currently you can ask whoever that is to get access if not...come up to me at the end of the</p>
      <p begin="00:16:56.120" end="00:17:05.750">...and we can make sure you get a email address or somebody can talk to if you're interested in...particular data types.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:05.750" end="00:17:07.920">Next we have search.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:07.920" end="00:17:11.190">So, searches...which is just you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:11.190" end="00:17:15.280">a very straightforward scenario for searching and we major we</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.280" end="00:17:18.930">enabled this for the different data types that were needed</p>
      <p begin="00:17:18.930" end="00:17:23.230">...very similar to the windows dot storage search api is if you use those in the past so</p>
      <p begin="00:17:23.230" end="00:17:28.470">should be easy for you...switch over and start using these for contacts you're able to search things</p>
      <p begin="00:17:28.470" end="00:17:33.560">like name email addresses and phone numbers we do support server search at</p>
      <p begin="00:17:33.560" end="00:17:37.660">...global address look up as well as match reasons so that you can show wire</p>
      <p begin="00:17:37.660" end="00:17:42.300">particular search query as matching hit highlighting some people know about us?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:42.300" end="00:17:46.620">For email we support sender recipient subject or body text.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:46.620" end="00:17:51.860">...we also support server search for that and finally for text messages we support searching conversations</p>
      <p begin="00:17:51.860" end="00:17:56.950">or message bodies here we have some right on the slide that's means that</p>
      <p begin="00:17:56.950" end="00:17:59.800">that's actually not implemented we don't have that yet</p>
      <p begin="00:17:59.800" end="00:18:03.620">in some cases it might make sense that we don't have that for like user data accounts,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:03.620" end="00:18:06.870">for example, there's not going to be a lot of them is probably not worth us to build</p>
      <p begin="00:18:06.870" end="00:18:11.910">...infrastructure for other stuff we...to get to it...available if it's</p>
      <p begin="00:18:11.910" end="00:18:18.980">something that you're interested user voices a great place to up give feedback for that definitely.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:18.980" end="00:18:23.090">So, again, green means good ready to go public capabilities</p>
      <p begin="00:18:23.090" end="00:18:29.220">general capabilities available for you yellow means there implement in...available but you do have to</p>
      <p begin="00:18:29.220" end="00:18:33.000">...special permission we might ask you to do some sort of privacy</p>
      <p begin="00:18:33.000" end="00:18:37.330">or user information thing before you actually...the data.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:37.330" end="00:18:45.640">And, red means that's not something that's implemented either by design or something that we just having gone to...</p>
      <p begin="00:18:45.640" end="00:18:48.820">So, like I mentioned some of those specifically</p>
      <p begin="00:18:48.820" end="00:18:51.610">calls and email api eyes are currently restricted.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:52.670" end="00:18:55.180">This is a large part of the reason why.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:55.180" end="00:18:59.900">So, we have enabled the end-user to be in control of their data is very important</p>
      <p begin="00:18:59.900" end="00:19:03.700">that users trust your applications trust the ecosystem trust the platforms.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:05.460" end="00:19:11.850">we have two levels of allowing the user control and</p>
      <p begin="00:19:11.850" end="00:19:16.850">in understanding about the level data access the first one that they see is actually</p>
      <p begin="00:19:16.850" end="00:19:21.230">the second one here and that's a declaration in the store download page.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:21.230" end="00:19:23.120">So, when you're app declares the security</p>
      <p begin="00:19:23.120" end="00:19:27.440">capabilities saying that it has access to one of these particular data types?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:27.440" end="00:19:31.750">And, then it's submitted to the store then the user will see on the details</p>
      <p begin="00:19:31.750" end="00:19:36.430">page this app has access to your contacts so that's the first amount of information that lets them know</p>
      <p begin="00:19:36.430" end="00:19:42.310">that your app is going to be reading that data then if they choose to do so there's these</p>
      <p begin="00:19:42.310" end="00:19:46.370">new privacy settings pages which are available on the most recent flights</p>
      <p begin="00:19:46.370" end="00:19:50.370">that are available out publicly and these allow the users to turn on</p>
      <p begin="00:19:50.370" end="00:19:55.350">and off access to things like contacts or appointments or</p>
      <p begin="00:19:55.350" end="00:20:01.480">text messages for individual applications so at any time the user is able to go and</p>
      <p begin="00:20:01.480" end="00:20:06.340">turnoff access to your for your app to these data types so it is important</p>
      <p begin="00:20:06.340" end="00:20:13.030">that you handle the cases where the user does that and we'll show you how to do that in a moment.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:13.030" end="00:20:17.910">being said we feel comfortable that this is the amount of control that the user should be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:20:17.910" end="00:20:22.890">have and is going to have...windows ten in order to make sure that they trust the platform and</p>
      <p begin="00:20:22.890" end="00:20:30.480">they trust your applications and they're willing to download them and run them experience...</p>
      <p begin="00:20:30.480" end="00:20:35.250">So, here's the same screenshot...windows desktop because this is of course all across windows</p>
      <p begin="00:20:35.250" end="00:20:35.900">send devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:37.080" end="00:20:42.120">All right so now we're going to switch over to visual studio and show you a demo showing these three features</p>
      <p begin="00:20:42.120" end="00:20:47.020">...covered here the ability to read data search and then the privacy</p>
      <p begin="00:20:47.020" end="00:20:51.920">of...go and take over your art thank you tony so,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:51.920" end="00:20:54.970">...what we're going to show you here is how you can read user</p>
      <p begin="00:20:54.970" end="00:20:59.630">...user contacts you can search...them how you can use the</p>
      <p begin="00:20:59.630" end="00:21:03.840">task to make your life easier to complete simple scenarios and finally we're going to talk</p>
      <p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:08.430">about through a little bit of how these new privacy settings are actually going to impact your app and how you have to code your</p>
      <p begin="00:21:08.430" end="00:21:13.100">app so to do that he showed you the app but just you have a rough idea what it looks like</p>
      <p begin="00:21:13.100" end="00:21:17.670">all it does is it brings up a list your contacts displays a little bit of information about them</p>
      <p begin="00:21:17.670" end="00:21:22.250">very simple...to show you the scenarios and...were to step through how</p>
      <p begin="00:21:22.250" end="00:21:27.070">it's actually accessing the users contact information so</p>
      <p begin="00:21:27.070" end="00:21:29.020">...deployed out here?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:29.020" end="00:21:31.950">And, but, hit the first break point so this is the first</p>
      <p begin="00:21:31.950" end="00:21:36.910">step whenever you're accessing user contacts what you're going to want to do...going to request from</p>
      <p begin="00:21:36.910" end="00:21:41.820">the store access to the users contacts database so</p>
      <p begin="00:21:41.820" end="00:21:46.070">...access and you can see here what I'm actually asking for is I'm asking</p>
      <p begin="00:21:46.070" end="00:21:50.660">for read-only access to all the contacts on the system...low more details</p>
      <p begin="00:21:50.660" end="00:21:55.200">...access types in a moment but for now what we're doing is we're sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:22:00.740">...people apps we want access to everything that we can on the system so we're going to requests...access and</p>
      <p begin="00:22:00.740" end="00:22:05.040">then the very next line here is very important I'm going to check to see if that store I got</p>
      <p begin="00:22:05.040" end="00:22:09.890">back was null and that no return value is how platform tells me that if I receive that</p>
      <p begin="00:22:09.890" end="00:22:14.380">nell it means I've been denied access ok maybe the</p>
      <p begin="00:22:14.380" end="00:22:18.640">...the privacy switch maybe I didn't declare the right capability my manifest but</p>
      <p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:24.180">I can't have access to this data right now and it's important to make sure you do this check every single time</p>
      <p begin="00:22:24.180" end="00:22:28.850">you request access to the store because you saw those toggle there it's just so easy for the user to go in</p>
      <p begin="00:22:28.850" end="00:22:32.300">...that switch on you so make sure you check every time because if it may be the</p>
      <p begin="00:22:32.300" end="00:22:36.510">tenth maybe the thirty it's time you do this requires that you actually eventually have that no value</p>
      <p begin="00:22:36.510" end="00:22:42.230">pop-up so let's say we've got access to the store everything's going swimming...the next thing</p>
      <p begin="00:22:42.230" end="00:22:47.100">we want to do is from the store we're going to get a contact reader now this reader</p>
      <p begin="00:22:47.100" end="00:22:51.470">...we're going to use to read all these different contacts at the store</p>
      <p begin="00:22:51.470" end="00:22:55.100">...very similar pattern to windows that storage reviews that before</p>
      <p begin="00:22:55.100" end="00:23:01.310">...we're going to get the reader and once we have the reader very simple we're going to request a</p>
      <p begin="00:23:01.310" end="00:23:06.280">batch of contacts from that reader all right we request that batch</p>
      <p begin="00:23:06.280" end="00:23:11.090">we...for to come back and there's going to be two checks you need to do once you have the batch the first</p>
      <p begin="00:23:11.090" end="00:23:15.420">check is you're going to make sure there was something in the batch that the user actually has friends</p>
      <p begin="00:23:15.420" end="00:23:20.610">actually has contactsthe next thing you don't want to check is the contact</p>
      <p begin="00:23:20.610" end="00:23:25.110">backs that batch status now in my case right here because I'm we're looking</p>
      <p begin="00:23:25.110" end="00:23:30.010">at local contacts is always going to return success but in the case where the user has enterprise</p>
      <p begin="00:23:30.010" end="00:23:34.590">contacts on a server dispatch status could come back with the...server in which case the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:34.590" end="00:23:39.540">user does actually have contacts but we can't hit that server endpoint for you right now so you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:23:39.540" end="00:23:45.130">pop-up something smart to...say hey, you know,...server connection check your endpoint.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:45.130" end="00:23:48.010">So, once you've done all that it's very simple you get</p>
      <p begin="00:23:48.010" end="00:23:52.690">...these contact objects and I just buying them in my view.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:52.690" end="00:23:55.920">...we go we can pop up and there we have it we have our contacting</p>
      <p begin="00:23:55.920" end="00:24:00.370">...now let's say you're uses the type of people who have a thousand</p>
      <p begin="00:24:00.370" end="00:24:04.760">frames on the social network another fifteen hundred on that one and they just really have to share that</p>
      <p begin="00:24:04.760" end="00:24:09.350">...image macro right now with that one friend so to help them out with that</p>
      <p begin="00:24:09.350" end="00:24:14.280">what we do is we provide the search api is to make it easy for you to search their...</p>
      <p begin="00:24:14.280" end="00:24:19.470">easy for them to...context...a little box of the top here and if I start typing and I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:24:19.470" end="00:24:22.040">share...my friend laura start chirping enamourd</p>
      <p begin="00:24:22.040" end="00:24:26.470">...look at how the code works and what you can see here is I'm just going to grab this search</p>
      <p begin="00:24:26.470" end="00:24:31.180">...from the why once I have...search...going to build one of these</p>
      <p begin="00:24:31.180" end="00:24:36.030">contact query options objects this is again very similar stony mention to the windows that storage</p>
      <p begin="00:24:36.030" end="00:24:40.570">...search name space and that's not an accident we really want to make sure you could reuse those skills</p>
      <p begin="00:24:40.570" end="00:24:45.370">you've got from searching before and use them again in this new space so what we're going to...</p>
      <p begin="00:24:45.370" end="00:24:50.500">content query option...pass in the user search strength and we're going to set what feels we</p>
      <p begin="00:24:50.500" end="00:24:53.720">want to query now I'm a general-purpose people</p>
      <p begin="00:24:53.720" end="00:24:58.570">...so I'm going to choose the search all the fields if you're writing email app you may only want to search</p>
      <p begin="00:24:58.570" end="00:25:02.340">for email address the phone tyler definitely passes in the...</p>
      <p begin="00:25:02.340" end="00:25:07.320">only search for phone numbers that's up to you have that control but right now I want to search for everything and I</p>
      <p begin="00:25:07.320" end="00:25:12.550">can so I search you'll see the very next thing is I create a contact reader with</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.550" end="00:25:17.160">my query options and that's it now I...that very same</p>
      <p begin="00:25:17.160" end="00:25:21.830">methods before you see so you can see here with just three lines of code</p>
      <p begin="00:25:21.830" end="00:25:26.570">I've added in the option for the user to search for context so it's very easy for you</p>
      <p begin="00:25:26.570" end="00:25:31.080">add this whole new feature and, you know, hopefully dot your users a little more and</p>
      <p begin="00:25:31.080" end="00:25:37.360">...we go we talk back into the app you can see...filter down lower?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:37.360" end="00:25:42.160">So, that's all great the next thing I want to show you here is the tasks ui.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:42.160" end="00:25:46.880">Now this task ui it has to be without a doubt my absolute favorite part of this name</p>
      <p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:51.700">space because it lets me look like a genius I can take all this hard work that</p>
      <p begin="00:25:51.700" end="00:25:56.630">somebody microsoft has done some other team I can take it I can put in my...and I look like the guy</p>
      <p begin="00:25:56.630" end="00:26:02.270">...all a great work so...bunch of different things you can do and we'll show you a couple here the first</p>

      <p begin="00:26:21.570" end="00:26:30.600">...mean the compose me email I've got my picture greetings from build twenty fifteen.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:30.600" end="00:26:35.130">again, we can do with phone calls for go back to my app or sms text messages</p>
      <p begin="00:26:35.130" end="00:26:38.820">and just going to jump into this...kind of see the code here as I go to send</p>
      <p begin="00:26:38.820" end="00:26:42.000">...sms as much emphasize again just how easy this is</p>
      <p begin="00:26:42.000" end="00:26:46.980">...to add your app all we do here is we knew up this chat message object I</p>
      <p begin="00:26:46.980" end="00:26:51.570">set the body and the recipient and this information comes from the contact object is</p>
      <p begin="00:26:51.570" end="00:26:56.870">already provided and then I simply call chat message manager show compose message a</p>
      <p begin="00:26:56.870" end="00:27:01.770">...with my message so there we go that's a total of four lines of code for lines of code</p>
      <p begin="00:27:01.770" end="00:27:05.830">of added a whole new feature in my app once again just so easy to add these</p>
      <p begin="00:27:05.830" end="00:27:11.020">new things and the other great part about this is already international...you don't have to worry about left to right</p>
      <p begin="00:27:11.020" end="00:27:15.230">text you don't have to worry about what happens when it's a european phone-number versus</p>
      <p begin="00:27:15.230" end="00:27:19.110">a north american phone-number versus australian phone-number all that's handled</p>
      <p begin="00:27:19.110" end="00:27:24.190">for-you by the system it's just so easy to go ahead.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:24.190" end="00:27:27.020">All right.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:27.020" end="00:27:29.740">All right and one last thing I want to show you here just</p>
      <p begin="00:27:29.740" end="00:27:37.200">...have a rough idea what's happening let's say the user decides...many break points.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:37.200" end="00:27:41.410">Oreos...the break points I can actually run my...ok so let's say</p>
      <p begin="00:27:41.410" end="00:27:46.020">you users been using your after a few weeks and unfortunately for some reason they decide today is not the</p>
      <p begin="00:27:46.020" end="00:27:50.410">...whoops...star here.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:50.410" end="00:27:50.810">Today's</p>
      <p begin="00:27:50.810" end="00:27:59.260">the day this app no longer gets access to my user contacts.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:59.260" end="00:28:03.450">So, what they can do is...into the settings...tony just showed you...if you</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.450" end="00:28:08.270">...out in privacy you go to contacts here and my users</p>
      <p begin="00:28:08.270" end="00:28:13.670">aside from adam he seems like a kind of sketchy dude...of access to my contacts anymore so I go</p>
      <p begin="00:28:13.670" end="00:28:18.400">ahead they foot that switch...two things to note first of all my...the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:18.400" end="00:28:22.440">...stack here and you'll see if I can bring it up it's been killed</p>
      <p begin="00:28:22.440" end="00:28:25.680">...stack so you're not going to have to worry about</p>
      <p begin="00:28:25.680" end="00:28:33.480">losing contact access midway through your apps execution you're going to get terminated?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:33.480" end="00:28:35.260">Gracefully suspended as.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:36.460" end="00:28:39.090">You will be gracefully taken off of execution</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.390" end="00:28:45.370">...now you'll see my out pops up</p>
      <p begin="00:28:45.370" end="00:28:49.100">detects hey I've lost contact to the store and this is...great because my</p>
      <p begin="00:28:49.100" end="00:28:54.090">...pretty much useless so I pop-up this whole dialogue that says could you please reconsider</p>
      <p begin="00:28:54.090" end="00:28:58.590">and make it just that much easier for users we've actually providing a deep links into the settings page</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58.590" end="00:29:01.790">...they click this button going to be brought up...to that page where they can</p>
      <p begin="00:29:01.790" end="00:29:04.270">foot that switch so hopefully we make it</p>
      <p begin="00:29:04.270" end="00:29:09.840">easier for them that they're going to want to go right in there and give you guys back access...floater</p>
      <p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:14.670">back on again you'll be gracefully terminated and.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:14.670" end="00:29:18.650">Once your app comes back up it has access so hopefully this is give you a</p>
      <p begin="00:29:18.650" end="00:29:23.650">rough idea how you can read access the data and sort of leverage some of the prebuilt experience</p>
      <p begin="00:29:23.650" end="00:29:33.580">that we have the tony's going to tell you a little bit more about how you can manage the privacy of your data.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:33.580" end="00:29:37.800">All right so that was all about reading data searching data now</p>
      <p begin="00:29:37.800" end="00:29:43.800">...about writing data into the system for a while on windows phone we've had the ability</p>
      <p begin="00:29:43.800" end="00:29:48.320">for you to create your own contact data and write that into the system</p>
      <p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:52.690">in a way that shows up for the people have experience</p>
      <p begin="00:29:52.690" end="00:29:57.400">is something that like scape in the...taken advantage of where the download the buddy list from the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:57.400" end="00:30:00.530">...network the right that into the system.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:00.530" end="00:30:03.960">And, then they're set up where the user can then find that data and the people</p>
      <p begin="00:30:03.960" end="00:30:08.890">hub in other places where there used to going for...data.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:08.890" end="00:30:12.590">Additionally and windows phone eight-point one we added</p>
      <p begin="00:30:12.590" end="00:30:18.070">the ability for applications to do that with appointments data as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:18.070" end="00:30:26.640">Nowit's possible to do that with ...email and text message data.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:26.640" end="00:30:30.830">This data as than data that's owned by your application but it's</p>
      <p begin="00:30:30.830" end="00:30:34.220">stored in the system and shared by the system.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:34.220" end="00:30:39.220">You have full read and write access to this data you're able to modify the contacts</p>
      <p begin="00:30:39.220" end="00:30:39.540">delete</p>
      <p begin="00:30:39.540" end="00:30:44.230">the contacts or update them however is necessary for that.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:44.230" end="00:30:49.450">We also give you controls on how much of that data your sharing whether that's with the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:49.450" end="00:30:54.690">...the first party applications or with other store applications we would prefer that you</p>
      <p begin="00:30:54.690" end="00:30:59.400">always share the data so that all experiences haven't we understand that there are some cases</p>
      <p begin="00:30:59.400" end="00:31:06.010">where that isn't really the best interests of the user the network or whatever.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:06.010" end="00:31:10.220">This is great for different types of scenarios whether that's apps writing service</p>
      <p begin="00:31:10.220" end="00:31:14.940">specific content if you have profile encountering data that's not available through the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:14.940" end="00:31:19.160">...other networks great to have that all aggregated together</p>
      <p begin="00:31:19.160" end="00:31:26.500">in places like the people hum and outlook calendar application.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:26.500" end="00:31:30.420">...I...said we have different amounts of security that are available for</p>
      <p begin="00:31:30.420" end="00:31:34.830">you to scope access that other applications half.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:34.830" end="00:31:37.670">For appointments and contacts we have three different</p>
      <p begin="00:31:37.670" end="00:31:42.920">...we have full read limited read...system only so</p>
      <p begin="00:31:42.920" end="00:31:47.280">full read means that other applications are able to read any of the data that</p>
      <p begin="00:31:47.280" end="00:31:51.230">you right in the system you're saying you're comfortable with that you want other people to be able to show</p>
      <p begin="00:31:51.230" end="00:31:55.730">that data and do cool things on top of that data?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:55.730" end="00:32:00.660">Limited read is going to be limited to just display data so that means</p>
      <p begin="00:32:00.660" end="00:32:05.260">that other applications will be able to read in the case of contacts your display name</p>
      <p begin="00:32:05.260" end="00:32:09.850">and the photo that is with that particular contact and we thought</p>
      <p begin="00:32:09.850" end="00:32:14.290">this was important because we want to make sure that other applications can build the same sort</p>
      <p begin="00:32:14.290" end="00:32:19.070">of views even if they don't have the individual pieces of data which might be particularly private</p>
      <p begin="00:32:20.190" end="00:32:24.370">the case of appointments that means that they can read things like subjects state in time and</p>
      <p begin="00:32:24.370" end="00:32:29.030">duration so that they can build basic week views debuts things like that and then deep</p>
      <p begin="00:32:29.030" end="00:32:34.650">link into the other applications that they need to for the particular details pages.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:34.650" end="00:32:39.440">...and email we just have to categories...rewrite or system only.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:39.440" end="00:32:44.300">...text messages we have system only available.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:44.300" end="00:32:47.890">So, again, just to repeat on these...color coding here we have these</p>
      <p begin="00:32:47.890" end="00:32:52.580">available for appointments and contacts and text messages are available with just</p>
      <p begin="00:32:52.580" end="00:32:57.400">the general capability text messages is actually a little bit odd though so she called out</p>
      <p begin="00:32:57.400" end="00:33:01.230">here...case of text messages those messages will not be</p>
      <p begin="00:33:01.230" end="00:33:05.970">showing up and the messaging app that ships with windows when you write them what we've enabled</p>
      <p begin="00:33:05.970" end="00:33:10.790">...a way for you to build a new messaging experience that includes both your messages and</p>
      <p begin="00:33:10.790" end="00:33:15.100">sm sms messages so what we provide as a custom data store for</p>
      <p begin="00:33:15.100" end="00:33:19.120">you to write your messages in...we handle things like conversation threading and</p>
      <p begin="00:33:19.120" end="00:33:23.970">provides you data model that you can then render those messages out and your own application</p>
      <p begin="00:33:23.970" end="00:33:31.580">and aggregated wvu on your network as well as some sms messages.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:31.580" end="00:33:34.560">And, then four calls and email these are continue to</p>
      <p begin="00:33:34.560" end="00:33:42.410">be restricted capabilities that require a permission...microsoft for the capability access.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:42.410" end="00:33:45.030">Ok, so, that's brings us to our second demo let's get right back</p>
      <p begin="00:33:45.030" end="00:33:48.680">into visual studio and we're going to show you how or other application actually</p>
      <p begin="00:33:48.680" end="00:33:58.600">rights contact data into the system a way that is then viewable and multiple...locations.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:58.600" end="00:34:02.840">I'm going to switch...into a bit of a different application this is the test bed</p>
      <p begin="00:34:02.840" end="00:34:05.280">...the tonia just should has shown earlier</p>
      <p begin="00:34:05.280" end="00:34:10.230">...simulates another social network which or some sort of application which has a</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.230" end="00:34:13.660">bunch of data that it wants to write into the system store so</p>
      <p begin="00:34:13.660" end="00:34:17.850">...to just a viewer this is something that is actually going to produce contact data in</p>
      <p begin="00:34:17.850" end="00:34:21.020">...the system store very simple we sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:34:21.020" end="00:34:24.820">a no-frills application here now what we want to show I'm going to show you is</p>
      <p begin="00:34:24.820" end="00:34:29.810">how this avocation creates its own custom store its own custom contact list and then</p>
      <p begin="00:34:29.810" end="00:34:35.460">rights that data in such a way that the other apps on the system can read it...first</p>
      <p begin="00:34:35.460" end="00:34:40.880">...create and app contact store and apparently already exist so we'll just get rid of</p>
      <p begin="00:34:40.880" end="00:34:48.090">that create anyone from scratch all right now to actually show you how that code works we're</p>
      <p begin="00:34:48.090" end="00:34:51.560">...do is will jump into that the code of at apps so first thing is</p>
      <p begin="00:34:51.560" end="00:34:55.670">we want to do it again it's more core request access from the contact</p>
      <p begin="00:34:55.670" end="00:35:00.650">manager to the contact store now there's a bit of difference here you can see at the end this time</p>
      <p begin="00:35:00.650" end="00:35:04.870">instead requesting access to all the contacts on the system...requesting access to only its</p>
      <p begin="00:35:04.870" end="00:35:09.790">contact but it once rewrite access to those context so a little bit of a switch</p>
      <p begin="00:35:09.790" end="00:35:14.880">live switch up here but you sort of see words...where it's going to go now once I've</p>
      <p begin="00:35:14.880" end="00:35:19.350">request access to the store I want to create my own data store.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:19.350" end="00:35:23.180">And, do this you're...create a contact list</p>
      <p begin="00:35:23.180" end="00:35:27.900">...contact stores made up of a number of contact lists and the reason we have a segregation here is</p>
      <p begin="00:35:27.900" end="00:35:29.360">...you can actually split up</p>
      <p begin="00:35:29.360" end="00:35:33.570">in control the security of your information you can have a contact list that is full</p>
      <p begin="00:35:33.570" end="00:35:38.420">viewable every other app on the system and then you have a contact list is only viewable by</p>
      <p begin="00:35:38.420" end="00:35:43.260">yourself and this hopefully will allow you to share just the information that you want to share with other</p>
      <p begin="00:35:43.260" end="00:35:46.580">...to maybe enable some scenarios where you want your data show up in</p>
      <p begin="00:35:46.580" end="00:35:51.390">...people hub but without leaking sensitive data or showing sensitive enterprise or, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:51.390" end="00:35:56.590">corporate data...you just don't want to share with everybody the world so we're going to do here is</p>
      <p begin="00:35:56.590" end="00:36:01.260">going to create a contact list and in this case...call my panda friends?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:01.260" end="00:36:03.950">And, once I've created the list going to set a few properties</p>
      <p begin="00:36:03.950" end="00:36:08.950">on first thing is I'm going to make sure it's not hidden that's.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:08.950" end="00:36:12.940">Pretty simple I want to share this with the world so let's make sure...public the next thing I</p>
      <p begin="00:36:12.940" end="00:36:16.820">want to do is I'm going to want to give app read access full access so</p>
      <p begin="00:36:16.820" end="00:36:21.820">in this case I'm saying every other app on the system it's okay you can come see my data come look at</p>
      <p begin="00:36:21.820" end="00:36:25.610">come use it for your experiences so for read access and for</p>
      <p begin="00:36:25.610" end="00:36:30.260">write access here I'm going to give system online this means the only thing they can common</p>
      <p begin="00:36:30.260" end="00:36:33.860">...my contact list is the system microsoft provided</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.860" end="00:36:37.280">...raps can't mess with your data but your user can go into the people</p>
      <p begin="00:36:37.280" end="00:36:41.310">up in edit your data if they want now there's also the option here where you can say,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:41.310" end="00:36:45.620">you know, nobody can read my data or nobody can write my data hopefully again these are sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:36:45.620" end="00:36:50.360">limited scenarios but it doesn't make sense...la social networks case where they, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:50.360" end="00:36:53.930">this data is being managed by the contact not by the</p>
      <p begin="00:36:53.930" end="00:36:58.860">users so let's not have them writing to it so again very simple</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.860" end="00:37:00.530">then we simply save...changes</p>
      <p begin="00:37:00.530" end="00:37:05.110">...contact list and we're ready to go if we jump back in and just take a quick look</p>
      <p begin="00:37:05.110" end="00:37:08.160">how this works I'm going to.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:11.500">Actually going to do this reset just a.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.500" end="00:37:14.020">So, I'm going to add this big panda contact to the system.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:15.110" end="00:37:19.760">Now as I add that big panda contact we jump back into my other app here.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:19.760" end="00:37:22.320">We jump back into the other up here.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:22.320" end="00:37:27.020">And, here we go we see this big panda contact that I just added so this way my</p>
      <p begin="00:37:27.020" end="00:37:31.430">social networking app was able to add some data into the store and habits surface</p>
      <p begin="00:37:31.430" end="00:37:36.250">...another apps experience so hopefully this allow you to share little data between apps and light up some cool</p>
      <p begin="00:37:36.250" end="00:37:42.120">interact experiences for us all right now I also notice little trick here is my contact</p>
      <p begin="00:37:42.120" end="00:37:45.610">your app is actually able to notice that there was a change and notice that something</p>
      <p begin="00:37:45.610" end="00:37:55.270">...the database so tell me give you a little introduction and how that worked?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:55.270" end="00:37:56.650">Thank you.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:56.650" end="00:38:01.540">So, yeah, we talked about so far as able to being able to the re data from the system.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:01.540" end="00:38:05.080">Or being able to write data into the system but...important be able to keep</p>
      <p begin="00:38:05.080" end="00:38:09.930">that data up-to-date you want to know about when the data that you've written in the system has been changed in the people</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09.930" end="00:38:12.480">of you also want to know if you're tracking the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:15.240">users contacts when they have made a change the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:15.240" end="00:38:20.770">contact that exist outside of your application and the way that we enable this now for your windows</p>
      <p begin="00:38:20.770" end="00:38:26.080">ten universal windows applications is that we provide change tracking</p>
      <p begin="00:38:26.080" end="00:38:33.430">for you that you can use across the different types of contact stores or the different types of data stores?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:33.430" end="00:38:38.120">...gets complicated quickly but we'll try to talk about is at a high-level</p>
      <p begin="00:38:38.120" end="00:38:40.870">how this how this works for you so...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:40.870" end="00:38:45.770">app will tell us when it wants to change track a particular data type whether</p>
      <p begin="00:38:45.770" end="00:38:49.060">that's the contact listen general that are available in the people,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:49.060" end="00:38:51.420">people hub or whether that's your own contact with</p>
      <p begin="00:38:51.420" end="00:38:57.680">the written or any other data types you say hey I want to change track this particular data type.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:57.680" end="00:39:01.180">Then your application and this kind of cases we show here in this</p>
      <p begin="00:39:01.180" end="00:39:06.470">particular diagram is able to write data in the system because it's this case</p>
      <p begin="00:39:06.470" end="00:39:12.100">its own contact database and but we're also</p>
      <p begin="00:39:12.100" end="00:39:14.670">we're able to have things like the people hub</p>
      <p begin="00:39:14.670" end="00:39:18.440">...data into that particular contact list so when the people have</p>
      <p begin="00:39:18.440" end="00:39:22.730">rights the data and we keep track of those changes that have been made sense the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:22.730" end="00:39:27.650">last time since you said you wanted to start tracking changes and we keep that pointer</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.650" end="00:39:32.490">for-you we persist that pointer across sessions across reboot you don't have to worry about</p>
      <p begin="00:39:32.490" end="00:39:37.850">that you say hey give me all the changes since I started change tracking and then we'll return those</p>
      <p begin="00:39:37.850" end="00:39:41.010">to you that after you've process room you say</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41.010" end="00:39:44.730">hey I accept the fact that I've read these changes</p>
      <p begin="00:39:44.730" end="00:39:48.930">what that means is that you flush them to discord you set them off to your server whatever</p>
      <p begin="00:39:48.930" end="00:39:53.330">...it is you persisted them away where you never want to see those changes again and we move that</p>
      <p begin="00:39:53.330" end="00:39:57.780">pointer for you to that new location and then we keep track of that so the next time</p>
      <p begin="00:39:57.780" end="00:40:05.040">you run your application you're able to say a give-me whatever...change since last time...</p>
      <p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:06.160">So, that's great, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:06.160" end="00:40:10.830">as long as you're want to be able to get up-to-date when your app...starting or when</p>
      <p begin="00:40:10.830" end="00:40:15.740">your app is your...to a different place what if you're apps already in the foreground</p>
      <p begin="00:40:15.740" end="00:40:20.210">so for those cases we have foreground notifications so this is important if the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:20.210" end="00:40:25.110">...sinking down data while you're app is in the foreground you want to make sure you have that up-to-date</p>
      <p begin="00:40:25.110" end="00:40:29.790">and real-time as the databases changing so we provided events and the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:29.790" end="00:40:31.720">type event handlers that you can use to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:31.720" end="00:40:36.230">know hey something changed in the database that's all they say they're just poke events</p>
      <p begin="00:40:36.230" end="00:40:40.830">but that combined with the change tracking means it's really easy to go figure out what</p>
      <p begin="00:40:40.830" end="00:40:45.750">has changed since the last time that you updated your data that allows you to keep the your you</p>
      <p begin="00:40:45.750" end="00:40:50.740">why up-to-date while you're in the foreground there...application is running?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.740" end="00:40:55.980">What about if your application not running so we've also enabled background tasks for each of the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:55.980" end="00:40:59.710">different data types that your application can subscribe to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:59.710" end="00:41:04.290">...also find out when there's been changes to those databases the exact same model</p>
      <p begin="00:41:04.290" end="00:41:07.950">as the foreground and reality can use pretty much the same code that you do for</p>
      <p begin="00:41:07.950" end="00:41:11.970">the foreground notifications but this allows you to perhaps</p>
      <p begin="00:41:11.970" end="00:41:15.600">...keeping an app cache of some of the data and that needs to stay</p>
      <p begin="00:41:15.600" end="00:41:21.080">up-to-date all the times this allows you to register for these background tasks and then even if</p>
      <p begin="00:41:21.080" end="00:41:24.270">you're app has not been run sense of reboot or if you're app is being close</p>
      <p begin="00:41:24.270" end="00:41:28.910">...wake you up give you the chance to do what you need to do to read that data to read the change</p>
      <p begin="00:41:28.910" end="00:41:33.770">tracking data and get your state back-up back up to date?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:33.770" end="00:41:35.230">It's also important for things like</p>
      <p begin="00:41:35.230" end="00:41:42.970">live tiles or toasts if you want to make sure that you can update those and real-time as those changes.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:42.970" end="00:41:43.380">Ok,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:43.380" end="00:41:48.310">so, that's important part of each of these different data areas...so we want-to make sure we show that to you...</p>
      <p begin="00:41:48.310" end="00:41:53.310">code also saddam to come back one more time and show you the change tracking as well as foreground</p>
      <p begin="00:41:53.310" end="00:41:58.190">...I'm all right thanks tony so we're going to show here is</p>
      <p begin="00:41:58.190" end="00:42:03.010">change checking on contacts which is a bit of a for scenario but remember this also works on</p>
      <p begin="00:42:03.010" end="00:42:06.240">email text messages things which are coming in live-in you're really,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:06.240" end="00:42:09.560">really going to want to change track especially if you're trying to replace messaging</p>

      <p begin="00:42:19.350" end="00:42:24.160">little bit a taste of the windows universal environment we're going to do here is I'm going to...one-star demo</p>
      <p begin="00:42:24.160" end="00:42:29.030">ing here and desktop and just so everyone's aware and clear on</p>
      <p begin="00:42:29.030" end="00:42:33.970">this everything we're doing here today you can go home right now with the sdk bits that we handed out</p>
      <p begin="00:42:33.970" end="00:42:38.970">yesterday and try...at home there's no magic here this is all available already to go there is</p>
      <p begin="00:42:38.970" end="00:42:43.540">one...little caveat and that is when you deploy two-sixty four-bit machine you have to do a</p>
      <p begin="00:42:43.540" end="00:42:47.930">sixty four-bit build you can't do the any cpu built the little bit of a bugged unfortunately in</p>
      <p begin="00:42:47.930" end="00:42:51.300">a current flight but we will fix...time we ship.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:51.300" end="00:42:54.350">So, this is flip over my builds here.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:54.350" end="00:42:57.720">And, deploy to.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:57.720" end="00:43:03.750">...and deploy to device that's my desktop.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:03.750" end="00:43:07.610">All right there we have it so we're going to bring up that exact same</p>
      <p begin="00:43:07.610" end="00:43:12.590">...this is the viewing after we saw earlier and we're going to just take a little bit of</p>
      <p begin="00:43:12.590" end="00:43:15.930">showing how it works and how does...change tracking?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:15.930" end="00:43:18.480">As well the same time we have the same.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:18.480" end="00:43:23.910">In a julia child's on here I'm going to bring up the other a test bed at that we already had.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:23.910" end="00:43:28.010">So, we're able to do here is make</p>
      <p begin="00:43:28.010" end="00:43:32.470">...data store if I add a contact with my network app we're</p>
      <p begin="00:43:32.470" end="00:43:37.060">going to see right away that appears in my viewing app.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:37.060" end="00:43:41.140">And, there we have...one-half...appears in the other app godiva</p>
      <p begin="00:43:41.140" end="00:43:44.470">little-bitty into how I do it so I'll just turn off</p>
      <p begin="00:43:44.470" end="00:43:47.390">...here for...a little the view.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:47.390" end="00:43:51.550">The first thing you do is when you open that store you're going to want to enable change dragging this tells</p>
      <p begin="00:43:51.550" end="00:43:56.080">us system hey I want everything from here on out I want to know about any changes</p>
      <p begin="00:43:56.080" end="00:43:59.220">happen your database and we're going to maintain this pointer</p>
      <p begin="00:43:59.220" end="00:44:04.200">...through...sets or somebody pulling the battery out your app getting suspended your</p>
      <p begin="00:44:04.200" end="00:44:08.660">app getting terminated we're going to maintain that pointer for-you so</p>
      <p begin="00:44:08.660" end="00:44:12.990">hopefully it makes a little easier for you and the other thing I'm going to do here is I'm going to register for this</p>
      <p begin="00:44:12.990" end="00:44:17.960">foreground event now this foreground event is just a polk is just wakes it's a little event I get</p>
      <p begin="00:44:17.960" end="00:44:21.930">the says hey something has changed go check your change tracker so</p>
      <p begin="00:44:21.930" end="00:44:25.600">...register for that now let's jump into that code here of</p>
      <p begin="00:44:25.600" end="00:44:27.060">twelve.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:27.060" end="00:44:31.970">There we have it so this is my event handler I'm doing my change tracking in the very first</p>
      <p begin="00:44:31.970" end="00:44:36.440">thing you want to do is so important is to grab this deferrals here.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:36.440" end="00:44:41.430">We make a promise to you that it well you're holding this referral we will not contact you</p>
      <p begin="00:44:41.430" end="00:44:47.020">are poke you with another event in so you release it which is fantastic I</p>
      <p begin="00:44:47.020" end="00:44:51.810">honestly when I first started coding is app I didn't realize you could do that a and had to do a lot of magic with</p>
      <p begin="00:44:51.810" end="00:44:56.350">new taxes and trying to deal with multi-threaded because I was making...call</p>
      <p begin="00:44:56.350" end="00:45:00.760">but it all goes away magically when you grab this deferrals so remember to do that</p>
      <p begin="00:45:00.760" end="00:45:05.380">so I...my defer all the next thing I want to do is grab my contact change reader</p>
      <p begin="00:45:05.380" end="00:45:09.370">this pattern again...really familiar from earlier when I did that just reading contacts</p>
      <p begin="00:45:09.370" end="00:45:13.390">...contact now I'm going to re contact deltas so same</p>
      <p begin="00:45:13.390" end="00:45:18.220">pattern you're reading a little bit different information so again grandma reader going to</p>
      <p begin="00:45:18.220" end="00:45:23.130">read a batch of contact changes and I'm just looping through them now every</p>
      <p begin="00:45:23.130" end="00:45:28.130">contact change comes with what we call a change type now this change type tells you what</p>
      <p begin="00:45:28.130" end="00:45:33.010">happened to the database that it also comes with the contact that changed so I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:45:33.010" end="00:45:35.940">...switch on the change type here and therefore</p>
      <p begin="00:45:35.940" end="00:45:40.460">different types of change events the first is a create very simple some</p>
      <p begin="00:45:40.460" end="00:45:45.410">app came in decided hey I'm going to stick a new contact in the database we'll let,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:45.410" end="00:45:48.970">you know, and, will...that context data the other type is a deleted</p>
      <p begin="00:45:48.970" end="00:45:53.770">again some context been deleted we'll let, you know, hey,...that from you I dropped from</p>
      <p begin="00:45:53.770" end="00:45:57.300">...database dropped from wherever you're keeping track?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:57.300" end="00:46:00.560">...next type is a modified this is a little trickier to handle in</p>
      <p begin="00:46:00.560" end="00:46:05.690">some cases because we're telling you something has changed so you have to go in and take a look at the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:05.690" end="00:46:10.680">...contact you've got to bit of...see what comes of different in my case because I'm being lazy and</p>
      <p begin="00:46:10.680" end="00:46:15.630">I'm just updating a ui I treated as a delete and...it just works fine.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:15.630" end="00:46:18.800">And, then finally the last one here is hopefully unfortunate case</p>
      <p begin="00:46:18.800" end="00:46:21.410">but exchange tracking lost this should</p>
      <p begin="00:46:21.410" end="00:46:25.520">be very rare but it can happen on occasion that something happens</p>
      <p begin="00:46:25.520" end="00:46:29.930">are database gets corrupted the fungus reset something happens beyond our control and we lose your</p>
      <p begin="00:46:29.930" end="00:46:34.510">pointer in this case unfortunately you're going to reload the context from scratch because the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:34.510" end="00:46:39.510">only thing we guarantee is that whatever you read after change tracking lost is going to be invalid it's not going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:46:39.510" end="00:46:44.210">useful so you see that one you see here I'm just resetting and re loading on my</p>
      <p begin="00:46:44.210" end="00:46:48.980">contacts from scratch hopefully...very rare case but you make sure it.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:48.980" end="00:46:51.620">And, one last thing I want to mention here...sort-of a general</p>
      <p begin="00:46:51.620" end="00:46:56.610">programming on windows thing but when you're using a system...switch statement please,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:56.610" end="00:47:00.100">please, please always make sure you have a default because we can actually</p>
      <p begin="00:47:00.100" end="00:47:02.090">add new values to the enumeration</p>
      <p begin="00:47:02.090" end="00:47:06.880">and later releases and we don't have break a whole bunch apps when we add that</p>
      <p begin="00:47:06.880" end="00:47:11.600">new value because they're not handling the default case so you just make my life a little less stressful I</p>
      <p begin="00:47:11.600" end="00:47:14.930">love it...just handle the defaults.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:14.930" end="00:47:19.440">And, then finally the last thing I come out here is a asses reader a I</p>
      <p begin="00:47:19.440" end="00:47:24.340">...these changes I'm never going to I never want to...changes again so when you save reader dot</p>
      <p begin="00:47:24.340" end="00:47:29.150">except changes we move that pointer to the bottom the list we say hey you're never going to</p>
      <p begin="00:47:29.150" end="00:47:33.840">see these again we promise you that and the next time you go and re changes you're going to see</p>
      <p begin="00:47:33.840" end="00:47:39.300">fresh new shiny changes and then the last thing you want...on your way out is released defer also</p>
      <p begin="00:47:39.300" end="00:47:45.400">...we can call you again if there are new changes that have happened since you went in.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:45.400" end="00:47:50.010">very simple you can see that you can pop up a case where I can keep my</p>
      <p begin="00:47:50.010" end="00:47:54.380">...up-to-date but unfortunately your app is an always...sometimes you get</p>
      <p begin="00:47:54.380" end="00:47:58.190">not in the background sometimes you get suspended so what we do is we</p>
      <p begin="00:47:58.190" end="00:48:01.820">...allow you to from a background task keep up-to-date with changes</p>
      <p begin="00:48:01.820" end="00:48:06.530">to user data and again we want to make this so simple for things you already know angus</p>
      <p begin="00:48:06.530" end="00:48:10.800">...this code I'm going to show for...because it is just so easy if you've ever registered</p>
      <p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:15.730">...task before this is the exact same code all admit I curb this from the wi-fi sample</p>
      <p begin="00:48:15.730" end="00:48:20.710">from windows eight it's the same stuff the only thing I changed here is that line right there I</p>
      <p begin="00:48:20.710" end="00:48:24.510">had a context or notification instead of wi-fi tty or network change</p>
      <p begin="00:48:24.510" end="00:48:27.930">...trigger so again just so easy...trying to make</p>
      <p begin="00:48:27.930" end="00:48:32.720">is low-stress as we can for you to do these things and I registered background task my background task now</p>
      <p begin="00:48:32.720" end="00:48:37.440">just papa toast whenever I see...change the notification store so just</p>
      <p begin="00:48:37.440" end="00:48:40.920">...quickly that are not line will do is bring up my app again.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:41.940" end="00:48:42.760">We will.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:44.030" end="00:48:50.470">Register...background register my background task again what I just showed you that code that so easy.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:50.470" end="00:48:55.340">And, now if I make a change the contact database we're going to see I get a little toast popping</p>
      <p begin="00:48:55.340" end="00:48:59.790">up...you can see...notification to say hey</p>
      <p begin="00:48:59.790" end="00:49:04.080">something's changed my database now little again what contrived for</p>
      <p begin="00:49:04.080" end="00:49:09.920">to for...text messages...these toasting resume important for user to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:15.660">drive them...to make sure they really trust and really know about the data on the devices changing</p>
      <p begin="00:49:15.660" end="00:49:20.310">now I'm going to switch over tony here and he's going to tell you a little bit about how you can get your</p>
      <p begin="00:49:20.310" end="00:49:29.850">app integrated in with some of the system experiences like the people out.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:29.850" end="00:49:34.850">All right so I showed you these...profile car's earlier on and mention that we had scape</p>
      <p begin="00:49:34.850" end="00:49:38.560">...link can xbox showing up on these and I'll talk about how</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38.560" end="00:49:43.070">your applications can show up here and these marquis experiences where the</p>
      <p begin="00:49:43.070" end="00:49:44.660">...going all the time.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:45.710" end="00:49:48.160">So, we have this concept called annotations</p>
      <p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:53.640">which allow you to annotate existing contacts that are already in the system and</p>
      <p begin="00:49:53.640" end="00:49:56.750">what you can annotate them with is a set of supported operations?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:58.100" end="00:50:00.350">You'll say that you support showing profile</p>
      <p begin="00:50:00.350" end="00:50:03.190">data or messaging data.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:03.190" end="00:50:04.510">Calling.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:04.510" end="00:50:07.200">Or social feeds.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:07.200" end="00:50:10.240">And, then in addition to saying that you support these you'll register for</p>
      <p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:13.000">a particular protocol launch that we have define.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:14.120" end="00:50:17.910">And, now will allow your application to show up on these particular contacts.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:18.930" end="00:50:23.270">So, your application comes along...you scape as the example.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:23.270" end="00:50:28.010">It says I know about the phone number two one three five zero one five</p>
      <p begin="00:50:28.010" end="00:50:31.610">nine does the system know about this phone-number system</p>
      <p begin="00:50:31.610" end="00:50:36.500">responds yes I know about this phone number that's this particular contact you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:50:36.500" end="00:50:38.810">annotated the application so,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:38.810" end="00:50:42.170">yeah, I know how to message this contact and I</p>
      <p begin="00:50:42.170" end="00:50:45.970">know how to audio and video call this contact great.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:45.970" end="00:50:51.280">Subscribe creates that annotation saves into the system and then scape is</p>
      <p begin="00:50:51.280" end="00:50:52.030">...listed on</p>
      <p begin="00:50:52.030" end="00:50:56.810">the profile pivot as a way to message that particular contact.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:56.810" end="00:50:59.970">We also keep track of the most recently used for each</p>
      <p begin="00:50:59.970" end="00:51:04.410">of the different communication modalities so if you...is somebody that</p>
      <p begin="00:51:04.410" end="00:51:08.900">I scape often rather than seeing sim listed there for text messaging you would see</p>
      <p begin="00:51:08.900" end="00:51:14.860">scape list of their and your application would be right there on par with that this applies to both</p>
      <p begin="00:51:14.860" end="00:51:19.430">the profile card which is the full people have experience as well as the</p>
      <p begin="00:51:19.430" end="00:51:23.290">many contact card which is something that I showed you earlier on</p>
      <p begin="00:51:23.290" end="00:51:26.980">...for windows tendesktop applications and it's</p>
      <p begin="00:51:26.980" end="00:51:33.170">going to be showing up all across the windows ten user interface and experiences.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:33.170" end="00:51:35.990">...in order to see a little bit clear on how this</p>
      <p begin="00:51:35.990" end="00:51:38.600">...here's the new outlook</p>
      <p begin="00:51:38.600" end="00:51:43.460">application so when the user goes...types in a particular</p>
      <p begin="00:51:43.460" end="00:51:48.280">contact user can then click on show more which brings up the contact car</p>
      <p begin="00:51:48.280" end="00:51:51.320">...a lot like link experience and desktop outlook,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:51.320" end="00:51:54.770">you know, is used to and here vibe or has</p>
      <p begin="00:51:54.770" end="00:52:00.000">actually registered for contact annotations for that contact user taps on the vibe</p>
      <p begin="00:52:00.000" end="00:52:05.040">...there and we launch straight into the conversation and vibe and the user can continue on to</p>
      <p begin="00:52:05.040" end="00:52:11.410">that conversation that they had previously started or initiate a new conversation with that contact?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:11.410" end="00:52:14.440">...end-to-end experience for the user</p>
      <p begin="00:52:14.440" end="00:52:22.910">and it's great for your application to appear and all these different locations.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:22.910" end="00:52:27.240">So, that's annotations so here's sort of a wrap-up slide.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:27.240" end="00:52:27.770">You know,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:27.770" end="00:52:32.540">we've been work and we've done made tons of new functionality here and windows</p>
      <p begin="00:52:32.540" end="00:52:35.510">...available on the public api sets and</p>
      <p begin="00:52:35.510" end="00:52:39.830">we know that we've built amazing things opportunities for you because the first</p>
      <p begin="00:52:39.830" end="00:52:44.500">party experiences are on top of those and we hope to see some really cool things coming out of the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:44.500" end="00:52:49.890">developer the developers you guys over the next year or longer we also know we're</p>
      <p begin="00:52:49.890" end="00:52:54.560">not done yet this table should be almost all green there should be maybe a few cases of read things</p>
      <p begin="00:52:54.560" end="00:52:59.350">I don't actually makes sense but we're working towards it and we really believe that we're working towards a</p>
      <p begin="00:52:59.350" end="00:53:02.990">places more open and more enabling you to do things with</p>
      <p begin="00:53:02.990" end="00:53:07.590">the user data and these experiences which are so core to</p>
      <p begin="00:53:07.590" end="00:53:13.770">a modern experience whether that's mobile or desktop experience.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:13.770" end="00:53:17.530">So, the final thing please do submit evaluations and then I'll</p>
      <p begin="00:53:17.530" end="00:53:29.650">be taken a few questions for looks like about the next six minutes here if anybody like to bring something up?</p>
      <p begin="00:53:29.650" end="00:53:34.530">Right so it the question is whether not exchange data and corporate environment data will be available through</p>
      <p begin="00:53:34.530" end="00:53:39.020">these api...and in generally speaking the contacts the appointments</p>
      <p begin="00:53:39.020" end="00:53:43.940">data are available yes, is the short answer so that me all</p>
      <p begin="00:53:43.940" end="00:53:50.170">the data is available and, the reading the contacts data yes you have that available</p>
      <p begin="00:53:50.170" end="00:53:54.020">same with the appointment data the email data itself is currently that</p>
      <p begin="00:53:54.020" end="00:54:06.830">restrictive format so that is not available ...will be available through these api seos?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:06.830" end="00:54:11.900">No, ...a...phone calls are mobile only so the question was whether</p>
      <p begin="00:54:11.900" end="00:54:15.010">...consent sms from a windows desktop</p>
      <p begin="00:54:15.010" end="00:54:21.480">application and there is no sms stack on the windows desktop currently so.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:21.480" end="00:54:22.620">When if and</p>
      <p begin="00:54:22.620" end="00:54:29.650">when we enable that in general on the windows desktop we would expect that these api as...be enabled also?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:29.650" end="00:54:34.780">just...follow-up if you're interested in taking a look at how you would detect to see if the...api</p>
      <p begin="00:54:34.780" end="00:54:40.280">...available where you are and the...your running on right now brent...</p>
      <p begin="00:54:40.280" end="00:54:45.030">talks more mornings...have a lot of information about detecting device capabilities and doing a good job</p>
      <p begin="00:54:45.030" end="00:54:57.000">of detecting what's available in where your current execution environment.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:57.000" end="00:55:02.280">I'm sorry I think the question was about social operations.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:02.280" end="00:55:02.700">Yes,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:02.700" end="00:55:11.200">so, that is available I am not an expert necessarily on that it is.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:11.200" end="00:55:16.150">I if you can what's that no nobody does nobody is talking about it out build but,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:16.150" end="00:55:21.010">yeah, if we want to talk afterwards I can get you in touch with a person who know more about that my</p>
      <p begin="00:55:21.010" end="00:55:26.350">understanding is it's mostly...api set brought forward from the windows phone</p>
      <p begin="00:55:26.350" end="00:55:32.500">eight-point one experience but opened up generally available to all applications.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:32.500" end="00:55:34.680">And, it might be mobile only.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:34.680" end="00:55:36.660">But, I'm not...</p>
      <p begin="00:55:36.660" end="00:55:42.370">...and product one.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:42.370" end="00:55:46.980">The so, the question is about duals them and yes the api handle it and,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:46.980" end="00:55:52.590">the case of phone lines one of the first thing you do when you either initiating a call or reading</p>
      <p begin="00:55:52.590" end="00:55:57.540">the call history data is you enumerate the lines that are on the system and those can be</p>
      <p begin="00:55:57.540" end="00:56:01.140">a multiple sims what one or more sims or they can be</p>
      <p begin="00:56:01.140" end="00:56:06.360">our app based and lines that are enumerated.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:06.360" end="00:56:14.230">...the...first.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:21.000" end="00:56:24.660">So, you can for the most part replace those applications</p>
      <p begin="00:56:24.660" end="00:56:29.370">...those experiences on windows desktop on windows mobile they remain</p>
      <p begin="00:56:29.370" end="00:56:34.370">the default experiences and the case with other apps for launching into them but like</p>
      <p begin="00:56:34.370" end="00:56:39.570">for the...new email api that just uses a mail to protocol</p>
      <p begin="00:56:39.570" end="00:56:45.260">launch so that's the only thing kind of making the outlook mail app the default experience so if</p>
      <p begin="00:56:45.260" end="00:56:48.690">you're application has the access to read it then it has all the same</p>
      <p begin="00:56:48.690" end="00:56:53.530">capabilities as the outlook application and when you bring up that if you remember on the</p>
      <p begin="00:56:53.530" end="00:56:58.010">task slides I know there's a lot in there but there was the api that was...</p>
      <p begin="00:56:58.010" end="00:57:02.900">a new accounts that's that experience that you're referring to where the user can go in and set up a</p>
      <p begin="00:57:02.900" end="00:57:07.780">exchange account or a google or I...other...we support and that's what</p>
      <p begin="00:57:07.780" end="00:57:20.040">rights those data in that data in whether that's...contacts or the email...data?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:20.040" end="00:57:24.730">Correct so the question was what does the email app actually talk to exchange server and no,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:24.730" end="00:57:29.570">it's actually system component that talks the exchange server...into the centralize database</p>
      <p begin="00:57:29.570" end="00:57:31.960">...allows your applications as well as</p>
      <p begin="00:57:31.960" end="00:57:36.840">multiple first party applications so one good example that is core</p>
      <p begin="00:57:36.840" end="00:57:42.090">...has done a flight tracking for a while so if that data with</p>
      <p begin="00:57:42.090" end="00:57:45.870">...in the email application core tama would presumably have to</p>
      <p begin="00:57:45.870" end="00:57:49.800">come up with some other mechanism in order to get that data whereas with this sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:57:49.800" end="00:58:04.560">model is available to multiple different scenarios powered by multiple different applications.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:04.560" end="00:58:16.720">I'm sorry I'm not getting that at...nodes change tracking but.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:16.720" end="00:58:20.480">Yes, so, the question was if I is the user make a change in the people after the</p>
      <p begin="00:58:20.480" end="00:58:24.130">contact database will natural for the contacts change tracking api</p>
      <p begin="00:58:24.130" end="00:58:29.000">...so when you say you're registering for the change tracking one thing we</p>
      <p begin="00:58:29.000" end="00:58:33.770">really go into a contacts our that contacts are when you human the people</p>
      <p begin="00:58:33.770" end="00:58:39.200">...what they are...aggregate contacts they're made up of multiple raw contacts a</p>
      <p begin="00:58:39.200" end="00:58:42.160">raw contact comes from one particular and</p>
      <p begin="00:58:42.160" end="00:58:45.160">...network whatever that is if it's an exchange</p>
      <p begin="00:58:45.160" end="00:58:50.450">service or a outlook dot com account like adam I might have a contact</p>
      <p begin="00:58:50.450" end="00:58:55.390">...work contact through exchange and then one...personal through my outlook dot comical</p>
      <p begin="00:58:55.390" end="00:59:00.880">...combined into and aggregate and that's what you wvu on the people hub so</p>
      <p begin="00:59:00.880" end="00:59:05.940">when you register for change tracking if you're doing the opening up that contact</p>
      <p begin="00:59:05.940" end="00:59:10.720">store scope as all contacts read-only...you really reading that are the</p>
      <p begin="00:59:10.720" end="00:59:15.710">...is the aggregate table so that's the table of all the people that show up not</p>
      <p begin="00:59:15.710" end="00:59:21.030">the individual raw contacts and that would be the one that you would want to change track on top of and</p>
      <p begin="00:59:21.030" end="00:59:25.660">if you change track on...anything that changes any of the...contacts that's in that aggregate</p>
      <p begin="00:59:25.660" end="00:59:34.410">table would results and change tracking information for you that you would have available.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:42.330" end="00:59:47.420">The,...theI don't know the specifics of the algorithm it's something we've you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:47.420" end="00:59:50.610">between king sense windows phone seven but,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:50.610" end="00:59:54.580">it yes if they had the same email address or the same</p>
      <p begin="00:59:54.580" end="00:59:58.030">...we also check the name and then if all three of those</p>
      <p begin="00:59:58.030" end="01:00:01.890">matches like a definite match and then if we get like one or two pieces of data</p>
      <p begin="01:00:01.890" end="01:00:07.730">...a partial matching we look at other data ...there's, there's stuff in there that</p>
      <p begin="01:00:07.730" end="01:00:09.770">...works in something we tweak...</p>
      <p begin="01:00:11.400" end="01:00:19.680">The back.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:19.680" end="01:00:24.520">Yes, so, that was actually the question about...social, social feeds at least that's what I thought he was asking</p>
      <p begin="01:00:24.520" end="01:00:29.410">...I hope that was the question this question was is they're going to be a what's new feed api</p>
      <p begin="01:00:29.410" end="01:00:34.170">and there is one available generally available to open to your applications and,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:34.170" end="01:00:38.970">again, if you're interested catch me afterwards and I'll get you to the email address at least the people get</p>
      <p begin="01:00:38.970" end="01:00:47.940">your more information.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:47.940" end="01:00:52.390">Yes, so, the question is if you're app is on installed than is your data removed and yes</p>
      <p begin="01:00:52.390" end="01:00:56.430">so whenever you're app of writing those custom data stores whether it's contacts</p>
      <p begin="01:00:56.430" end="01:01:02.950">or appointments or the other ones if you're app is on install we remove that data from the system.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:02.950" end="01:01:07.440">All right and I think...here unfortunately but you have any more questions feel free to come</p>
      <p begin="01:01:07.440" end="01:01:12.180">asks afterwards or we're going to be in the windows insider lounge which is sort of over</p>
      <p begin="01:01:12.180" end="01:01:16.570">...by the windows for the next ninety minutes if you have any questions at all about user</p>
      <p begin="01:01:16.570" end="01:01:21.590">data storage apps anything just come feel free to ask us and we'll try and help you out or at least</p>
