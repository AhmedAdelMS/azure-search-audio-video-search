      <p begin="00:00:17.220" end="00:00:20.810">yusef here steven who going to give you a talk about</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.380" end="00:00:28.390">how to effectively manage the network to meet the needs of your application so as,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.390" end="00:00:32.710">you know, we have introduce something called the measure resource make</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.710" end="00:00:35.290">...infrastructure for as</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.290" end="00:00:39.610">...which you can describe through templates what they</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.610" end="00:00:42.610">...are in terms of the resources and</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.610" end="00:00:49.370">hardware composed and in the system will...for you today's talk is about how you can</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.370" end="00:00:53.640">describe the needs of view of the apps with respect to network how</p>
      <p begin="00:00:53.640" end="00:00:58.600">...should look like how structured and how you can change it either imperative re also</p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.600" end="00:01:02.980">a template basically okay so I'll give you a bit of setup of</p>
      <p begin="00:01:02.980" end="00:01:06.520">...the basic model what you can do for the network on the like and why with</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.520" end="00:01:10.610">...developer and then see will come up and show you</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.610" end="00:01:14.340">the object model the restful api is</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.340" end="00:01:25.380">...the dishonor in their csharp portion how...can actually use the model?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.380" end="00:01:30.890">Reminder please do submit evaluation please?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.890" end="00:01:35.260">So, quick agenda will not...on this much tell you a bit more why would</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.260" end="00:01:41.580">...a value proposition for you why would you...developer to be able to control the network.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.580" end="00:01:45.750">Give you a very quick view what about arm which is a as</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.750" end="00:01:50.680">a resource manager the way you which you describe that you replication and the way</p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.680" end="00:01:57.700">the system orchestrate...and effectively is lifecycle management.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.700" end="00:02:00.490">We'll tell you...more about...specific topic</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.490" end="00:02:05.410">for today which is the network resource provider which is the resource manager</p>
      <p begin="00:02:05.410" end="00:02:09.020">...api in question here then we're going to go</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.020" end="00:02:12.860">through hands-on api assure demos cheer code.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:12.860" end="00:02:19.860">And, we're...in the...your questions as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.860" end="00:02:22.630">So, why should you care I mean we're here</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.630" end="00:02:27.720">...build...the reason for this talk if you remember anything here we want to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.720" end="00:02:33.340">empower developers to control their own destiny?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:33.340" end="00:02:38.110">To write the code quickly and to configured environment for the code quickly.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.110" end="00:02:42.190">This could be in a...cycle or even production.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.190" end="00:02:47.810">So, as, you know,...alright what I services...develops model we</p>
      <p begin="00:02:47.810" end="00:02:52.550">...we tested we deploy it we monitored and we</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.550" end="00:02:58.710">fix it...something goes wrong or repeat in effect, effect we are solve removing other folks who</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.710" end="00:03:01.590">lisa depend on...applications done.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.590" end="00:03:03.380">We have tooling.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.380" end="00:03:08.560">And, now we also have a way for you to define the network of your application in all</p>
      <p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:11.340">...days you meaning how be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.340" end="00:03:15.220">...some code testament aside but if you want something real.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.220" end="00:03:19.360">...talked to somebody get your network manage</p>
      <p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:23.130">the network configured load balance, you know, the story.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23.130" end="00:03:26.900">With this system now everything is virtual...everything's software</p>
      <p begin="00:03:28.090" end="00:03:31.900">...not only can you write the...your application but you can also</p>
      <p begin="00:03:31.900" end="00:03:40.460">configured the network to replications needs or...software basically.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:40.460" end="00:03:46.230">Lesley I want to emphasize that the in the plumbing underneath the cover</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.230" end="00:03:50.970">...for networking which can be quite extensive you don't have to do or</p>
      <p begin="00:03:50.970" end="00:03:53.440">know everything about.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.440" end="00:03:56.840">You can write application with the...as you're</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.840" end="00:04:01.410">in a very simple network flat network what every virtual machine for every into</p>
      <p begin="00:04:01.410" end="00:04:06.380">talk to each other very simple crichton application that requires...a simple</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.380" end="00:04:12.450">load balance or as you will see in the gory details of the model</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.450" end="00:04:17.140">...can go down to defining networks a subbed that's and tackles and some stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:04:17.140" end="00:04:23.810">frankly you only need to for very sophisticated applications so again</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.810" end="00:04:27.550">splice spectrum here disappears eagle.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.550" end="00:04:28.990">Enables you to have a</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.990" end="00:04:33.090">...the ops model where you are in control your destiny.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33.090" end="00:04:37.640">You can write the...quickly and you can deployed quickly and you can change it</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.640" end="00:04:41.820">and environment around quickly to effectively software.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.820" end="00:04:45.070">No, hardware needed here and no...</p>
      <p begin="00:04:46.150" end="00:04:51.650">Heavy expertise rookies needed to get your applications the done.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.650" end="00:04:58.720">So, we have discussed before the agile resource manager.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:03.650">At the highest level...the very top you have the service...api is...effectively</p>
      <p begin="00:05:03.650" end="00:05:08.260">every resources manager has something called a resource provider</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.260" end="00:05:10.980">and entity that export a bunch of api is.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12.170" end="00:05:12.960">And, what's...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:16.750">It could be an ip.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.750" end="00:05:22.630">Address for your network could be load better in point it could be virtual machine.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.630" end="00:05:25.470">Could be a storage table, for example, these...resources</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.750" end="00:05:31.010">...basically is a way to uniformly describe?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31.010" end="00:05:36.010">In through templates and imperative api is how you can compose application</p>
      <p begin="00:05:36.010" end="00:05:39.880">opted resources how they relate to each other and how should they be deployed</p>
      <p begin="00:05:39.880" end="00:05:45.570">cohesiveness does orchestration for you for your resources?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.570" end="00:05:46.200">And, you</p>
      <p begin="00:05:46.200" end="00:05:50.730">...effectively every resources badger the exports through</p>
      <p begin="00:05:50.730" end="00:05:55.170">our through the same uniform fashion and the constituted</p>
      <p begin="00:05:55.170" end="00:05:58.220">the for networking effectively apply...resource providers.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:59.400" end="00:06:04.530">The restful api is the language bindings over them so forth.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.530" end="00:06:07.260">So, the consistency is important and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.260" end="00:06:11.990">the flexibility is very important and note gets to arm you'd</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.990" end="00:06:15.970">be will find templates we get a publish...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.970" end="00:06:20.770">those templates a template described...the topology of the application or</p>
      <p begin="00:06:20.770" end="00:06:26.590">...resources that you need to make the application to actually come to existence you can start with</p>
      <p begin="00:06:26.590" end="00:06:29.680">an existing template modify to your needs</p>
      <p begin="00:06:29.680" end="00:06:33.710">...me have some of the gory details that you can forget or</p>
      <p begin="00:06:33.710" end="00:06:36.730">become modify...so within this</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.730" end="00:06:45.280">model we can also do the same now for once...of resources are the network resources.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:45.280" end="00:06:49.840">One more thing...before...networking per say once you buy into</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.840" end="00:06:53.680">our model you get a bunch of benefits that accrue to all resources</p>
      <p begin="00:06:53.680" end="00:06:58.270">...adj I mention the grouping function moments...so</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.270" end="00:07:03.220">you can manage collection of diverse resources basically has units.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:03.220" end="00:07:07.890">...template with say this how the...other this how they should be configured when you</p>
      <p begin="00:07:07.890" end="00:07:13.320">...one configured that one so forth so does a groupie function.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.320" end="00:07:18.630">And, you end up with ecosystem interface the same architecture will apply both and...the public</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.630" end="00:07:24.680">klout and on premises as...and the other talks here in other forms</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.680" end="00:07:31.380">...show you how effective the same model the same concepts apply to interface.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:31.380" end="00:07:36.190">You also have ...of we end up with features</p>
      <p begin="00:07:36.190" end="00:07:38.110">...come in for all resource providers,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:41.910">for example, are back broad-base x control what he can</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.910" end="00:07:46.440">dissed described for each resource who can do what do it who can</p>
      <p begin="00:07:46.440" end="00:07:51.130">modify token just monitored so forth you get tagging resources we can</p>
      <p begin="00:07:51.130" end="00:07:55.900">at attach tags to resource...that way?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:55.900" end="00:08:00.170">And, of course has with other resources and as you can decide in which</p>
      <p begin="00:08:00.170" end="00:08:03.530">...or location they have to live.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:03.530" end="00:08:11.970">On the your...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:11.970" end="00:08:16.680">They are really three core resource providers that are very close to each other and which showed object</p>

      <p begin="00:08:29.780" end="00:08:35.410">would now there is a network resource...which describes the network topology of your</p>

      <p begin="00:13:35.140" end="00:13:40.540">...but look at the to decipher a second the basic concept is</p>
      <p begin="00:13:40.540" end="00:13:43.760">in the right-hand side you see the virtual network.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:43.760" end="00:13:45.630">This is the resource in which are applications</p>
      <p begin="00:13:45.630" end="00:13:49.150">on-base basically and you can have</p>

      <p begin="00:14:23.510" end="00:14:27.380">And, you could go down even lower if you want to have the notional over network interface</p>

      <p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:39.020">Okay,...come over...even will now go through next level</p>
      <p begin="00:14:39.020" end="00:14:43.920">of detail here we'll talk about the object models in some detail and which would exactly as</p>

      <p begin="00:14:56.960" end="00:15:03.370">So, unfortunate nobody laptops giveaway today but this it's very interesting so we</p>
      <p begin="00:15:03.370" end="00:15:08.790">start working...the optimal reps and here is...model for</p>

      <p begin="00:15:23.890" end="00:15:27.760">...for example,...you get automatically when you create a</p>

      <p begin="00:15:36.780" end="00:15:40.900">With ios there's a little bit more control you get your gm's you get</p>

      <p begin="00:15:54.830" end="00:15:56.900">So, with this with this new model</p>
      <p begin="00:15:56.900" end="00:16:00.270">we decomposed all of these relationships into a</p>
