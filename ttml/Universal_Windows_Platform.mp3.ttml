      <p begin="00:00:07.090" end="00:00:14.070">...back in may have thousand good...rector peter tour of the windows...you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.070" end="00:00:18.710">learned today about the wind universal windows platform so we want to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.710" end="00:00:23.260">talk today of a couple of the program managers who were sort of leading the designer for their</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.260" end="00:00:28.590">for that api set to talk about the api set and what actually means so the first question I would</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.590" end="00:00:33.470">ask essentially how did you arrive at a universal windows api</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.470" end="00:00:38.320">...how did...work...off that on</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.320" end="00:00:45.090">...sowhat we did was we had windows...a one they had a</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.090" end="00:00:49.650">survey...available to them and we...windows phone a major one...belgium</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.140" end="00:00:56.550">...available...to do was basically bring the best of all these things together</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.550" end="00:00:59.370">and expand on it so that we could add more capabilities to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.370" end="00:01:06.050">...so we ...will tell us a little bit about how what percentage of</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.050" end="00:01:10.970">...functionality taught inside universe windows platform we started with these three divest platforms</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.970" end="00:01:15.140">brought them together into one and then we listen to a lot of customer feedback about things</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.140" end="00:01:20.630">or missing...so there's many examples one out...for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:20.630" end="00:01:23.790">threads in windows eight one windows finite</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.790" end="00:01:27.660">...those were not to thread pool but we didn't use the traditional</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.660" end="00:01:33.030">...thirty-two api like create...etc with a lot of customer feedback about that which</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.030" end="00:01:37.750">...that so when you have this windows platform...windows ten now includes a lot more</p>
      <p begin="00:01:37.750" end="00:01:42.030">...like threading on more...who want to but based</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.030" end="00:01:44.740">...customer feedback and relapse we had people building</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.740" end="00:01:47.070">a windows virtually expanded that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:47.070" end="00:01:51.560">...just what was interesting platforms lowest common denominator like this tiny little lump</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.560" end="00:01:53.470">of functionality was take what's in</p>
      <p begin="00:01:53.470" end="00:01:58.040">these in these three different platforms bring the boca together and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.040" end="00:02:03.360">expanded all-out...feedback awesome and one thing that I wanted to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:08.340">highlight is the default policy going forward is new api</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.340" end="00:02:14.380">...part of the universal plan so we're trying not to fragment the api and say this is</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.380" end="00:02:18.890">an xbox api sort only ends up on the xbox device or</p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.890" end="00:02:24.750">...phone api the default policy is to put the api everyone?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:24.750" end="00:02:28.800">Now there's some subtleties there like, for example.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:33.530">Making up a scanner...probably will never have a scanner on...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:33.530" end="00:02:38.420">xbox just doesn't make a lot of sense the api is there.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.420" end="00:02:42.920">Because so if I...app that wants to use of scanner...the natural api and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.920" end="00:02:46.840">say give me...the scanners on this device and the api</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.840" end="00:02:49.300">...works on xbox they'll say well they're</p>
      <p begin="00:02:49.300" end="00:02:54.600">...here just like on desktop if you didn't have any plugged in so</p>
      <p begin="00:02:54.600" end="00:03:00.100">developers are not going to have to the...I can help whichhave to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:00.100" end="00:03:04.530">write different code for different devices which they had to do traditionally</p>
      <p begin="00:03:04.530" end="00:03:09.210">...universal windows platform is really to the extent we can humanly make</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.210" end="00:03:11.650">...universal?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.650" end="00:03:15.950">And, I think just building...said in the past again with windows,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.950" end="00:03:20.190">windows phone...xbox you could have a similar source code base but</p>
      <p begin="00:03:20.190" end="00:03:26.100">...would if that's if that photon...that in the new world even where there</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.100" end="00:03:30.180">are cases where maybe there is an api for legacy reasons only actually</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.180" end="00:03:33.840">exists on xbox needed...anymore you can actually seems</p>
      <p begin="00:03:33.840" end="00:03:38.360">...so runtime this...be talking about on friday you...friday</p>
      <p begin="00:03:38.360" end="00:03:43.060">friday's at runtime you can detect ocean I...scanner api should I</p>
      <p begin="00:03:43.060" end="00:03:47.640">called up the windows...back but maybe I should I call this api know if</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47.640" end="00:03:53.670">...a single qubits truly a single code base so before we get to question of</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.670" end="00:03:59.050">...thank you man...niners been asking questions for years.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:59.050" end="00:04:03.460">How does universal apps work on io...surely not required</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.460" end="00:04:10.150">dubious so how does universal apps on t work?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:10.150" end="00:04:14.850">Surely they don't require you to...from the store out where</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14.850" end="00:04:20.300">...you asking...so...the first question so</p>
      <p begin="00:04:20.300" end="00:04:24.170">...to platform is part of the universe windows platform so you can</p>
      <p begin="00:04:24.170" end="00:04:28.180">rights universal windows epsilon io...hire to epsy right</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.180" end="00:04:34.200">...windows absolute work on phone xbox...et cetera et cetera</p>
      <p begin="00:04:34.200" end="00:04:38.900">the distribution of apps on I...can be different I'm not an expert on that.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.900" end="00:04:40.990">So, I correct answer that the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:40.990" end="00:04:45.160">school part of it but yes they are universe windows apps they have the same api</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.160" end="00:04:48.870">...every other universe windows up has is just a windows...</p>
      <p begin="00:04:50.360" end="00:04:57.040">the only thing I would add is there are differences between devices for you so you want</p>
      <p begin="00:04:57.040" end="00:05:02.020">to think about that when we talk about universe lap you can write one code base compile it</p>
      <p begin="00:05:02.020" end="00:05:06.850">deployed all these devices same api is for all practical purposes</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.850" end="00:05:10.650">...available everywhere but if you projecting to a</p>
      <p begin="00:05:10.650" end="00:05:12.350">ten foot screen or</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12.350" end="00:05:16.770">...hollow lens on a fitness band or some future device</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.770" end="00:05:22.170">and you probably want to have different uri but you can either there's something called adaptive</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.170" end="00:05:26.910">...of you online those animal team has a presentation today</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.910" end="00:05:30.460">and multiple about...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:30.460" end="00:05:35.460">that's not actually might area of expertise mine is more the actual api itself so</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.460" end="00:05:40.730">if I were writing...an app for io t have the choice it'll run on everywhere</p>
      <p begin="00:05:40.730" end="00:05:45.600">I want the same ui everywhere probably not so you'd customize so</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.600" end="00:05:49.560">...for io t you probably have a customize ui for a</p>
      <p begin="00:05:49.560" end="00:05:56.950">desktop for laptop or tablet but that can all be in one...can be...minor.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56.950" end="00:06:00.050">...wants to know now that dot net...ported to linux</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.050" end="00:06:06.400">...macro...which is an excellent taking on rightdo you see universal apps running on</p>
      <p begin="00:06:06.400" end="00:06:12.020">android ios and universal out?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:12.020" end="00:06:17.830">So, taking...the rt if you will and moving on different platforms.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:17.830" end="00:06:21.390">We haven't discussed...anything like that</p>
      <p begin="00:06:21.390" end="00:06:27.310">founder question get past security great question so the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:27.310" end="00:06:35.020">...also wants to know does this universal philosophy apply...windows servers.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.020" end="00:06:38.290">It does.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:38.290" end="00:06:42.370">There's a deploying apps to the server means most servers may not want to</p>
      <p begin="00:06:42.370" end="00:06:46.880">...apps from the store so ignoring the deployment aspect because you can always</p>

      <p begin="00:07:09.380" end="00:07:12.020">the term marketing has not approved...</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.310" end="00:07:16.730">...core platform is common to all</p>

      <p begin="00:07:25.140" end="00:07:29.560">To the extent that we make an api universal which is like I said the default we</p>
      <p begin="00:07:29.560" end="00:07:35.540">...do we put it on one core and becomes available on all platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:35.540" end="00:07:38.230">But, of course servers habit sorbet different workload</p>
