      <p begin="00:00:36.670" end="00:00:41.600">Like powerpoint...subtly different into...it all the text is taken from the</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.600" end="00:00:45.300">middle layer...the back-end...this you can listen through</p>

      <p begin="00:01:10.000" end="00:01:15.310">Right there's...feedback...feedback please let us know questions comments</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.310" end="00:01:23.410">...also...extensions for you so we can bring more and better information.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.410" end="00:01:27.900">So,...this talk about accessibility and spent about probably seventy years</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:32.255">...my career talking about accessibility people thinking about it it's really want</p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.255" end="00:01:36.110">to talk about what is accessibility any...have to do that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:36.110" end="00:01:40.420">in context with a disability so spend some time talking about different classes</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.420" end="00:01:43.910">and disabilities...of possible...those are situational or data</p>
      <p begin="00:01:43.910" end="00:01:50.260">day or maybe even tempered depending what's going on and then kind of why we do the work.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.260" end="00:01:58.500">So, we'll talk about what motivates us why we like...going on.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.500" end="00:02:00.350">...defect speaker so who are</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.350" end="00:02:04.920">...and what is accessibility team and what we think about the parts you think about everyday</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.920" end="00:02:10.800">...kind of walk...pieces for and then we're going to take a little journey</p>
      <p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:14.910">...focus on...because a lot of time they went unspoken developers or</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.910" end="00:02:19.490">that convene said hey look I don't know needs to really make and accessible for</p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.490" end="00:02:22.900">...reader and the truth is it's really</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.900" end="00:02:26.910">...this is already in your head and to build a...and talk to and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.910" end="00:02:34.480">app is pretty straightforward easy to do and sort of walked and then from there we're going to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:39.880">live...with...and...kind of...you guys theater dance developers and we're</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.880" end="00:02:42.950">...look at the to common patterns that we</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.950" end="00:02:47.930">...people toknown understand and really?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:47.930" end="00:02:54.960">...to fix and understand...people with the using people who...screeners.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:54.960" end="00:03:01.100">So, we dive into the successfully for your app again...design for every designs are</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.100" end="00:03:05.410">...the design and really...writing...sketching a picture of it</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.410" end="00:03:10.310">...usually good at saying I click on a b happens of</p>
      <p begin="00:03:10.310" end="00:03:15.330">interactive c and d happens so really you build this nice big-state diagram and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.330" end="00:03:18.890">...only three step to consider which is a start state...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:18.890" end="00:03:24.300">and...repeat that quite a bit and the talk...make more sense of go along and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.300" end="00:03:28.230">at the end of it the beauty of...is...it turns out to be a fairly</p>
      <p begin="00:03:28.230" end="00:03:32.180">...amount of code very small number of lines and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:32.180" end="00:03:37.850">...go something is very accessible...be accessible on the...the desktop analysis</p>
      <p begin="00:03:37.850" end="00:03:47.530">believable and...to where all of the windows universal platform...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47.530" end="00:03:51.260">So, when we think about what is a disability we think about a</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.260" end="00:03:55.610">...disabilities and these are some of them and not all of them but some...cognitive</p>
      <p begin="00:03:55.610" end="00:04:00.850">...you have...need for less information because that's all you can process?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:00.850" end="00:04:04.700">In some cases you need less information because it's too much stimulus overload</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.700" end="00:04:06.980">institute some cases</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.980" end="00:04:11.660">...studies with focus autism they find that the less type of data they have</p>
      <p begin="00:04:11.660" end="00:04:15.480">a available to them action the better they are...function.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:15.480" end="00:04:18.780">...learning disabilities people...even</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.780" end="00:04:24.650">...dyslexia orders calcium where you can't really process fright.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:24.650" end="00:04:28.870">Process...equations.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.870" end="00:04:31.580">But, the thing I learned disabilities there's always the flipside...are learning</p>
      <p begin="00:04:31.580" end="00:04:36.420">ability so my case and low-vision I'm legally blind so I learned from really listening</p>
      <p begin="00:04:36.420" end="00:04:41.140">really well so it's also about bringing data to someone...a way that they can</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.140" end="00:04:47.260">consuming whether it's through audio author visuals and look at visual impairments as a range of visual</p>
      <p begin="00:04:47.260" end="00:04:52.220">impairments what...go through a few samples in the next slides.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:52.220" end="00:04:58.220">There's motor impairments...about motor impairments is that there's a range of them anymore</p>
      <p begin="00:04:58.220" end="00:05:02.380">...have parkinson's disease you may have trouble doing fine motor control.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:02.380" end="00:05:07.340">...also be something more temporary you've broken error and you can't use it how do you</p>
      <p begin="00:05:07.340" end="00:05:12.080">...the system or more recently a friend of mine had a little baby tommy is</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12.080" end="00:05:15.130">...baby...the interact with the system.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.130" end="00:05:21.130">That's kind...range of spectrum credibility impact and how people's lives?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.130" end="00:05:23.380">...perception...text size of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23.380" end="00:05:29.120">the common thank you get older the ability to read small text decreases.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:29.120" end="00:05:32.930">So, how do you help that I find that people...you might arms have gotten</p>
      <p begin="00:05:32.930" end="00:05:36.890">...as I've gotten older I...I try to holdings farther and farther way</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.220" end="00:05:41.820">...part of this accessibility getting us to where we have longer arms</p>
      <p begin="00:05:41.820" end="00:05:46.180">...ok great is...build adapt that because</p>
      <p begin="00:05:46.180" end="00:05:52.300">excuse me because you're for it may be...need things larger?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52.300" end="00:05:55.870">...that you have color perception also so I spent quite</p>
      <p begin="00:05:55.870" end="00:06:01.680">a time writing reports I put together...some...and some green and yellow and I put a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:05.370">little excel spreadsheet I sent it out and probably ten minutes later</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.370" end="00:06:09.700">sever managers replied back and I said I'm color-blind accessibility</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.040" end="00:06:15.600">so it kinda have to think through the things of it was easy for all forget like</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:21.150">you get like said we still struggle with this with this particular manager is actually presenting tomorrow and,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:21.150" end="00:06:25.420">he's red green color-blind...to this day years of working with...we still have...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:25.420" end="00:06:31.530">wrong colors yes exactly and there's a combination of things color perception and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:31.530" end="00:06:35.660">...text gets smaller and smaller...process</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.660" end="00:06:39.580">...contrast issues now we live in seattle not a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:06:39.580" end="00:06:40.990">of sunny days.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:40.990" end="00:06:42.970">But,...walking out in the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:42.970" end="00:06:47.940">sun chinese my cellphone and suddenly all of data washes out and I find myself</p>
      <p begin="00:06:47.940" end="00:06:54.830">...into a shadow to try to read to read interact my cellphone because...contrast...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.830" end="00:06:57.050">...and that analogous</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57.050" end="00:07:00.380">...when contrast goes to zero that could be because you have no</p>
      <p begin="00:07:00.380" end="00:07:05.830">site or because of situations where you frankly relatively user site, yeah, so,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.830" end="00:07:10.390">for example, I would argue that low-carb very low contrast as appropriate for text messaging and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.390" end="00:07:16.870">cars yes software things should not be doing...driving.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:16.870" end="00:07:21.150">And, then we have and it has been...have all what are some</p>
      <p begin="00:07:21.150" end="00:07:25.050">...severe motor functions and really what can you do through</p>
      <p begin="00:07:25.050" end="00:07:30.400">...technology so really what...accessibility...to us and we think about</p>
      <p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:34.690">it should about usability that connects lives in this case.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:34.690" end="00:07:37.280">Steve's able to use has technology to communicate with</p>
      <p begin="00:07:37.280" end="00:07:43.030">his family his wife and friends and in those simpler case today</p>
      <p begin="00:07:43.030" end="00:07:47.690">or project...powerpoint out to your device allows me as a presenter to connect</p>
      <p begin="00:07:47.690" end="00:07:51.450">...in the best possible allows someone with low-vision</p>
      <p begin="00:07:51.450" end="00:07:55.110">...no vision to hear and...not miss what's going on</p>
      <p begin="00:07:55.110" end="00:07:59.330">so really for us about how do we connect people through technology</p>
      <p begin="00:07:59.330" end="00:08:09.700">certainly starts with you and how do we help you build and create a moreaccessible...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:09.700" end="00:08:12.600">And, that really comes through things why do we want to</p>
      <p begin="00:08:12.600" end="00:08:16.750">do it well for us again it's really about impacting people's lives</p>
      <p begin="00:08:18.110" end="00:08:23.090">kind of maximizes if you're app...you're building applications for education or for the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:23.090" end="00:08:26.920">workplace or just for fun it really allows everybody to kind of interaction</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.920" end="00:08:30.840">use application and flows are developers or pragmatic sometimes you</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30.840" end="00:08:35.370">want test automation so how do I make sure I continue to build my app make sure works</p>
      <p begin="00:08:35.370" end="00:08:40.160">...work...forward and frankly...doing it's kind of fun it's great to go out help people out</p>
      <p begin="00:08:40.160" end="00:08:46.340">...think about different ways to really build interaction model between people.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:46.340" end="00:08:49.150">...parts in the stack.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.150" end="00:08:52.560">So, the top of courses always your app...a different frameworks</p>
      <p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:54.360">...can use you can use the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:54.360" end="00:08:59.180">...framework web html framework wintry to if you like</p>
      <p begin="00:08:59.180" end="00:09:02.830">...kind of flows down through some of the lower layers around url animation</p>
      <p begin="00:09:03.860" end="00:09:07.420">...little time...animation because it really is the contract.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.550" end="00:09:12.630">Is that the api set that actually says the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:12.630" end="00:09:19.340">intent of your application so if, you know, you want something to work from button or list box?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:19.340" end="00:09:24.890">...in a way that allows this...to have a read to someone or</p>
      <p begin="00:09:24.890" end="00:09:28.890">...action on behalf of somebody.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:28.890" end="00:09:32.210">And, if you look at throughout the sectors input pieces how do</p>
      <p begin="00:09:32.210" end="00:09:35.860">you do input for those it can't move well how do you</p>
      <p begin="00:09:35.860" end="00:09:40.690">render the text so it's easy-to-read for high contrast scenarios now the things</p>
      <p begin="00:09:40.690" end="00:09:44.450">again enable the other side of that which is assistive technology?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:45.520" end="00:09:49.890">Scenarios are built-in screenwriter how do you really help someone who</p>
      <p begin="00:09:49.890" end="00:09:55.680">is blind interact or low-vision reed and interact with the data...on the screen.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:09:57.680">There's some basic voice command control and</p>
      <p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:01.210">...windows speech recognition and use that same data</p>
      <p begin="00:10:01.210" end="00:10:05.470">sonata click controls interact with controls nissan example</p>
      <p begin="00:10:05.470" end="00:10:10.340">that third-party assistive technology to the toby eye tracking help</p>

      <p begin="00:10:21.130" end="00:10:26.060">What is it that we kind of think about and own and work on every day and we work on that...layer work</p>
      <p begin="00:10:26.060" end="00:10:30.590">...html layer work and making sure that your code as easy translate</p>
      <p begin="00:10:30.590" end="00:10:34.590">...so that way enables net narration if</p>

      <p begin="00:10:37.220" end="00:10:41.940">third-party assistive technology so we run that entire gamut...spend everyday kind of think about how to make a better</p>
      <p begin="00:10:41.940" end="00:10:46.860">and simpler for you to do that and today's talk focuses primarily</p>
      <p begin="00:10:46.860" end="00:10:52.530">on screen reading because there's a large benefit that comes from doing this?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:52.530" end="00:10:54.350">If you work through the api set</p>
      <p begin="00:10:54.350" end="00:10:58.750">of problems space you end up helping do not only narrator but speech recognition</p>

      <p begin="00:13:21.220" end="00:13:25.930">...to me what it is...this is roughly the sketch and build.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:25.930" end="00:13:30.160">I said...they mention will have tiles they could be square</p>

      <p begin="00:13:49.570" end="00:13:55.560">idea we think we can do that but we're really worried about what it means to rearrange</p>
      <p begin="00:13:55.560" end="00:14:00.540">I said okay we'll tell me what happens as well...put my finger down.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:00.540" end="00:14:03.490">And, I start moving the item.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:04.500" end="00:14:09.800">And, nothing really happens until I get to a certain state everything snaps.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.670" end="00:14:16.450">...right so someone code you start...you can.</p>

      <p begin="00:14:34.060" end="00:14:38.530">It turns out in this case it's just a drag drop pattern and you start.</p>

      <p begin="00:29:26.070" end="00:29:33.240">let's look so this was a lot of code it was pretty painful let's look at</p>
      <p begin="00:29:33.240" end="00:29:35.280">So, here's the total...we have.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:36.420" end="00:29:38.750">So, we added three lines of code</p>
      <p begin="00:29:38.750" end="00:29:42.640">...markup and these two function calls to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:42.640" end="00:29:47.280">...selected and we made one other change which was to add the ari alive and</p>
      <p begin="00:29:47.280" end="00:29:53.610">the...about total of six changes to make that pretty accessible that's a nice thing when folks</p>
      <p begin="00:29:53.610" end="00:29:58.460">...walk through it really what we do we looked at the app dissected the</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.460" end="00:30:03.430">image...through it and one of the visual things are going on in the app at that time</p>
      <p begin="00:30:03.430" end="00:30:13.320">...walk through...few pieces of mark-up and...good.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:13.320" end="00:30:16.070">Well, there's a second set of things that we see</p>
      <p begin="00:30:16.070" end="00:30:21.120">folks commonly do and that is that they love to have groups.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:21.120" end="00:30:24.190">Of things and you don't really know.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:24.190" end="00:30:29.870">When transitions happen so today if you think about</p>
      <p begin="00:30:29.870" end="00:30:35.450">...such as music apps and video apps and loading things across the web there's</p>
      <p begin="00:30:35.450" end="00:30:39.500">always larger level set and you click on it reuse list boxy load</p>
      <p begin="00:30:39.500" end="00:30:46.090">a bunch of stuff may take a while and then either have one or more things that show up?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:46.090" end="00:30:47.930">So, in this again we have</p>
      <p begin="00:30:47.930" end="00:30:51.610">...here's...top-level list a sets.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:51.610" end="00:30:55.560">And,...loading who knows what it's doing during that load.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:55.560" end="00:30:59.220">And, then we get to the end there maybe one or more things there.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:59.220" end="00:31:09.840">So, thank you built pretty much the same app, yeah, based on a color selection.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:15.540">So, here instead of using html woodside you...show this behavior and, this is</p>
      <p begin="00:31:15.540" end="00:31:20.910">...like...the very common pattern we see people reusing the list box in this case I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:31:20.910" end="00:31:26.550">...have a set of colors we go and we can drill into one of these</p>
      <p begin="00:31:26.550" end="00:31:31.430">and social all the colors that map...to that color so,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:31.430" end="00:31:35.580">here we can see three things that are that sorry...couplings...this color and we go</p>
      <p begin="00:31:35.580" end="00:31:41.640">to different color we have do ...have a few other things and,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:41.640" end="00:31:46.310">each case what I've done to simulate the common pattern we see people kind of get messed up and we have</p>
      <p begin="00:31:46.310" end="00:31:49.610">...delay between each one of these screens so,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:49.610" end="00:31:53.740">if we look we're going to let's see what behavior we get by default out of</p>
      <p begin="00:31:53.740" end="00:31:57.610">sample because now we have a real list hopefully...a little better oltre</p>
      <p begin="00:31:57.610" end="00:32:02.440">...read system dark purple system dot elections dot generic dot</p>

      <p begin="00:32:10.210" end="00:32:17.380">...that part of what if we go in here...one more things...case we navigated</p>
      <p begin="00:32:17.380" end="00:32:23.150">...now we're sitting in the back we didn't hear I...know there was loading hopefuls it I</p>
      <p begin="00:32:23.150" end="00:32:28.320">...know where focus went which?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:28.320" end="00:32:31.600">...have the same process.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:31.600" end="00:32:33.460">So, what happens in this case is that</p>
      <p begin="00:32:33.460" end="00:32:38.230">again you look at the start state loading happens loading finishes and</p>
      <p begin="00:32:38.230" end="00:32:43.230">...really knows kind of what happened so we've got a couple things to fix yep what we</p>
      <p begin="00:32:43.230" end="00:32:48.510">want to go out...area however that we're naming let's give the naming first?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:48.510" end="00:32:54.680">Just side effect where sometimes you get the classed name added to your overall name and that's</p>
      <p begin="00:32:54.680" end="00:32:58.690">...useful what we did we did most of them...a really smart languages</p>
      <p begin="00:32:58.690" end="00:33:03.560">it takes whatever data item you put into a list view it uses that...the...gels to</p>
      <p begin="00:33:03.560" end="00:33:09.370">...now that works out great until the object you get is something like a.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:09.370" end="00:33:11.090">A key value...</p>
      <p begin="00:33:11.090" end="00:33:13.120">The generic collection which is what some idea</p>
      <p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:17.270">...this example very easy to do so in that case to string of a key value</p>
      <p begin="00:33:17.270" end="00:33:23.900">...reads the classing which is very not useful so let's fix that.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:23.900" end="00:33:29.220">So, in we've added events to grid view which lets you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:29.220" end="00:33:37.010">when the content for containers changing...go to that event?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:37.010" end="00:33:41.370">And, we'll go in and implement this with our new code.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:41.370" end="00:33:50.460">Instead of throwing exception.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:50.460" end="00:33:53.110">...a up moi what.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:54.570" end="00:33:57.390">This does if we have two types of items in</p>
      <p begin="00:33:57.390" end="00:34:02.310">our list we have either the top-level things which are these key value...or we have the lower-level</p>
      <p begin="00:34:02.310" end="00:34:07.670">things which are individual colors since I'm reusing the same grid view for the items</p>
      <p begin="00:34:07.670" end="00:34:12.190">...use a template selector which...familiar with...model...selector what</p>
      <p begin="00:34:12.190" end="00:34:16.860">you choose between different views in this code I'm just going to look at the data type of the</p>
      <p begin="00:34:16.860" end="00:34:22.490">...the term...I need to do so the important call here is automation properties that set</p>
      <p begin="00:34:22.490" end="00:34:26.820">name and this allows me to control the name...going to be read for this basically when this</p>
      <p begin="00:34:26.820" end="00:34:31.380">thing gets activated what you want narrator to speak so, it's really easy to go</p>
      <p begin="00:34:31.380" end="00:34:41.570">set this property using our data model as we can push that in once you have a fixes.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:41.570" end="00:34:46.290">So, now hopefully if we do right we will hear good it's much better...esri</p>
      <p begin="00:34:46.290" end="00:34:51.220">...one of twenty-seven...selected so...the</p>

      <p begin="00:34:56.360" end="00:34:59.920">there is listing the color name like and all that stuff came for free the</p>
      <p begin="00:34:59.920" end="00:35:04.350">selection all that's...by default you get a pretty good experience you just need to figure out</p>
      <p begin="00:35:04.350" end="00:35:09.760">these little details to go tweak exactly exiting...now the nice thing here.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:15.360">...the...space it was rf and in the vema cases automation peers.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:15.360" end="00:35:19.590">...properties, properties...yes thank you.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:19.590" end="00:35:20.820">All right so,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:20.820" end="00:35:25.580">we saw a couple of things we didn't get which was ...the.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:25.580" end="00:35:26.080">Traditions.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:27.490" end="00:35:30.790">Opposite yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:30.790" end="00:35:35.670">To that let's notify people about what's going on so many click it</p>
      <p begin="00:35:35.670" end="00:35:37.840">...toutes know that...loading</p>
      <p begin="00:35:37.840" end="00:35:45.560">...waiting for infinity and the least to give them an idea of what's going on.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:45.560" end="00:35:49.310">So, we did this html we use the...live region feature which</p>
      <p begin="00:35:49.310" end="00:35:53.740">allowed us to have a little text area that we said hey every time we change that we want you to go read this to the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:53.740" end="00:35:58.930">user so they know what...a similar thing here in the geometry soldiers...I'm going to go</p>
      <p begin="00:35:58.930" end="00:36:04.260">...somewhere in the tree pretty much almost can be anywhere...put this element...so,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:04.260" end="00:36:11.250">we just want to text...that can...blog at...</p>
      <p begin="00:36:12.710" end="00:36:19.300">And, then we'll say we want to have it have a automation properties dot</p>
      <p begin="00:36:20.850" end="00:36:24.920">Setting is...similar what we did before.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:24.920" end="00:36:29.150">What other important thing we should do here because we already have a progress</p>
      <p begin="00:36:29.150" end="00:36:33.790">indicator for those pesky sighted people who can see the screen yes having a</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.790" end="00:36:39.570">duplicate of text area we'll probably get their way yes so I think we should make this invisible</p>
      <p begin="00:36:39.570" end="00:36:44.470">...yes but not collapsed not collapsed so...capacity zero</p>
      <p begin="00:36:44.470" end="00:36:48.960">now it's important for those of you take note home to make the opacity zero not visibility</p>
      <p begin="00:36:48.960" end="00:36:53.170">...visibly...takes it out the visual tree as will not be seen will not be</p>
      <p begin="00:36:53.170" end="00:36:58.060">read will not participate in accessibility by making opacity zero it is invisible but</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.060" end="00:37:03.930">it is processed so in this case we can use this to trigger the narrator to read the right thing?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:03.930" end="00:37:08.610">Great so now we just need to have a little function that's</p>
      <p begin="00:37:08.610" end="00:37:10.430">...right function.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:10.430" end="00:37:17.640">Of the work for taking over okay great.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:17.640" end="00:37:26.150">...going to say a function called voidupdates.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:26.150" end="00:37:33.190">just taken the message insource a reader dot text equals the message we want to say.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:33.190" end="00:37:37.820">Lovely perfect and we have one lastly to do so that automation properties</p>
      <p begin="00:37:37.820" end="00:37:42.630">...this and,...loves control.</p>

      <p begin="00:40:43.280" end="00:40:46.210">Narrator read all of my code.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:46.210" end="00:40:48.570">Okay, now remember that's that line of code that was</p>

      <p begin="00:40:55.410" end="00:41:02.370">So, let me explain what this does if we have some items in the grid view we want to restore focus to</p>
      <p begin="00:41:02.370" end="00:41:06.160">that first item now if you're using example in a</p>

      <p begin="00:41:10.920" end="00:41:15.820">does the right thing it sets...focus to the right element it puts the right thing in restores focus</p>
      <p begin="00:41:15.820" end="00:41:20.770">the last thing it hasn't journal for tracking the stuff however</p>
      <p begin="00:41:20.770" end="00:41:26.690">the reason we're showing you this way is that we continue to see people who re-use their</p>
      <p begin="00:41:26.690" end="00:41:31.670">list because there's actually some performance benefits of taking the same list...it again and again...you</p>
      <p begin="00:41:31.670" end="00:41:34.460">...this way example just doesn't know what to do it's not going</p>
      <p begin="00:41:34.460" end="00:41:39.170">to steal focus from your app so it's not going to do...by default so,... how to take on some of this</p>
      <p begin="00:41:39.170" end="00:41:44.420">bird is a case where even as a sighted user the fact that my focus was getting kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:41:44.420" end="00:41:48.850">...that back button as a keyboard user would be pretty annoying eventually learn that every time you</p>

      <p begin="00:41:54.170" end="00:41:59.680">...narrator just doesn't...correct so what we do here is I scroll interview the</p>
