      <p begin="00:00:06.560" end="00:00:11.170">Right how you guys doing pretty good so there was an interesting announcement</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.170" end="00:00:15.610">today that you guys have a little bit of work on could you tell us what</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.610" end="00:00:18.050">that is...I was pretty excited when I watch</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.050" end="00:00:22.040">has would say maybe we should use visual studios somewhere else</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.040" end="00:00:26.460">...you guys in working on how...come about.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.460" end="00:00:32.310">Well,...been working on what has become which...code which is an editor</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.310" end="00:00:34.470">which provides to.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.470" end="00:00:39.480">Reach coding...experience and neutrons cross-platform so</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.480" end="00:00:43.080">you can code wherever you are with the technologies</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.080" end="00:00:47.880">uone right so what how is...I was interest because my side I thought what</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.880" end="00:00:51.370">...looks similar to some other things how is it built-in.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.930" end="00:00:57.580">So, we didn't start from scratch the first of all there is a history...be work on html</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.580" end="00:01:03.120">five base tooling and editing experiences kind of four years.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:05.350">And, we started with an.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.380" end="00:01:11.480">Online tools like their lawn which was a labels on national since</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.480" end="00:01:13.110">...jan monaco which allows</p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.110" end="00:01:16.860">...sites kind of in the browser.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.860" end="00:01:22.270">And, this is matured over time and, we basically you're using this technology and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.270" end="00:01:25.850">...jan monaco the editor and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.850" end="00:01:30.280">...to...we also leveraging at these run-time infrastructure</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.280" end="00:01:34.530">two-run html five that node and javascript as a</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.530" end="00:01:39.440">desktop application which is kind of this electron which has...with at michelle from</p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.440" end="00:01:44.140">...which gives us the run-time infrastructure we put our editor on top and then of course</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.140" end="00:01:48.670">...also...together and he came out quite a different architecture for</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.670" end="00:01:54.160">...although languages benches to maybe languages like csharp.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.160" end="00:01:56.290">Right now this is a go ahead sorry</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.290" end="00:02:00.120">... the history the editors is quite interesting as well actually</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.120" end="00:02:06.100">that it's non-transfer...was the first thing that the team produced and.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:06.100" end="00:02:10.750">The first liberals for that editor work in things like one drive or as your</p>
      <p begin="00:02:10.750" end="00:02:16.080">or visual studio online...twelve to but the editor also shifts in the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.080" end="00:02:21.120">...twelve so when you bring up that...tools for...explore that is the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:21.120" end="00:02:24.290">...what we call the monochrome and that's the core of</p>
      <p begin="00:02:24.290" end="00:02:28.430">...business your code so it's...over the past four years it's been development</p>
      <p begin="00:02:28.430" end="00:02:32.980">...been battle tested and you know, performances grade handle</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.980" end="00:02:37.830">very long on media...savior aggressive dog food.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:37.830" end="00:02:43.170">So, when we started development...three-month so for...he started doing all of</p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.170" end="00:02:48.070">the development using our...less painful the beginning but this</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.070" end="00:02:52.020">has continue it's good to have pain when you're building the...that's giving you paint</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.020" end="00:02:57.460">right, yeah, that's cool so it seems like you had all of this investment into monaco and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.460" end="00:03:04.060">you thought well let's go level two and just make an application that you can run anywhere?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:04.060" end="00:03:09.110">That's interesting so we had we have we still have...on...websites we have monaco</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.110" end="00:03:14.200">...the browser right and it's actually quite a successful</p>
      <p begin="00:03:14.200" end="00:03:19.300">tool is like three thousand people that use it every month the out whatever</p>
      <p begin="00:03:19.300" end="00:03:21.770">...the wanted-to ...the challenges</p>
      <p begin="00:03:21.770" end="00:03:27.200">with posting tools is the fact that developers have a full.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.200" end="00:03:30.780">Toolbox full of things that they use day-in-and-day-out and,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.780" end="00:03:33.250">it's very difficult to take...tools and bring them up to the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:33.250" end="00:03:38.130">...right so we looked at you know-how can we make the environment</p>
      <p begin="00:03:38.130" end="00:03:42.710">...run in the cloud more robustwe also looked at should be then go</p>
      <p begin="00:03:42.710" end="00:03:47.760">...cross-platform and bring it to more and more machines so we had the opportunity to take the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:51.950">technologies running up...the cloud and bring a cross-platform get the benefits of the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.950" end="00:03:56.390">...lightweight tooling environment easy access from anywhere but,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.390" end="00:04:02.320">it runs...machines...integrates...rest, yeah, that's a pretty cool sort</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02.320" end="00:04:06.130">of I really liked the idea of doing that...it...javascript.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:07.180" end="00:04:10.230">No, actually no we started four years ago did there was</p>
      <p begin="00:04:10.230" end="00:04:14.000">...javascript and...the same time types...emerge</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:18.830">...of diverse early adopters of types...and restarted</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.830" end="00:04:23.310">gradually adopting more and now weights at all types fifth the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:24.760" end="00:04:29.540">...architectures now multiprocessor architecture because you also want to support csharp</p>
      <p begin="00:04:29.540" end="00:04:33.930">right and for csharp microsoft has this nice...infrastructure...which you don't</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33.930" end="00:04:39.350">...rewriting childless...and the baby leverage...is by a rom</p>

      <p begin="00:04:44.220" end="00:04:49.070">...through a simple protocol and he factor and in fact</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.070" end="00:04:53.380">...open-source project has already started doing that which was called open</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53.380" end="00:04:55.420">...and all-new shar</p>
      <p begin="00:04:55.420" end="00:04:59.340">...joint this efforts...some of my team members actually</p>

      <p begin="00:05:03.990" end="00:05:08.260">The nice thing is many comes to...services you can write them into language you</p>

      <p begin="00:05:24.860" end="00:05:28.930">team-building so we work on and extensibility</p>
      <p begin="00:05:28.930" end="00:05:33.920">infrastructure but we decided snot mature yet not radiate right and we take</p>

      <p begin="00:05:42.580" end="00:05:47.110">...all of everything right so that's...set for the preview that you</p>
      <p begin="00:05:47.110" end="00:05:50.580">...able to date there is no extension infrastructure alka so</p>
      <p begin="00:05:50.580" end="00:05:55.430">the behind-the-scene people cedar is a...fold and stuff like that but we</p>
      <p begin="00:05:55.430" end="00:06:00.540">don't it's not public right so it's very nice especially the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.540" end="00:06:05.260">architectures that if you want to extended another language</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.260" end="00:06:10.220">services runs out of process it's not like you have to fit into the mold that we've defined you</p>

      <p begin="00:06:31.700" end="00:06:35.940">javascript is such a forgiving language when it comes to doing stuff.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.940" end="00:06:36.440">Is that good</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.440" end="00:06:41.210">or bad I don't know I have my own opinion about that</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.210" end="00:06:46.100">...five-foot comes around reversal get a sites around all right we have some questions coming</p>

      <p begin="00:06:51.240" end="00:06:54.950">...direct the fact that visual studio code is not</p>

      <p begin="00:10:36.780" end="00:10:41.520">to definition and levels three is really kind of refactoring and right now we</p>
      <p begin="00:10:41.520" end="00:10:42.760">...phony csharp</p>
      <p begin="00:10:42.760" end="00:10:46.900">...that levels three and javascript html.</p>

      <p begin="00:10:51.670" end="00:10:56.630">and est behind-the-scenes to understand the code more than text right that's why it's...code</p>
      <p begin="00:10:58.990" end="00:11:02.040">...school so but eventually we're going to have</p>
      <p begin="00:11:02.040" end="00:11:06.710">a system where if you have language food when you want to make sure you have support language</p>

      <p begin="00:11:12.550" end="00:11:16.570">...connection adding a new language is...of the interesting scenarios</p>
      <p begin="00:11:16.570" end="00:11:22.470">...all right question here...to bubble platforms such as android ios</p>
      <p begin="00:11:22.470" end="00:11:28.560">...windows...that's an interesting question because this...javascript.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:28.560" end="00:11:33.480">You can run an visual studio monaco on these devices right</p>
      <p begin="00:11:33.480" end="00:11:38.470">you'd even right that we...on and android template we did...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:38.470" end="00:11:43.020">So, there are scenarios...makes sense but for what we have free might be code</p>
      <p begin="00:11:43.020" end="00:11:47.950">...kind of seven by twenty-four coding righty it's not the top</p>
      <p begin="00:11:47.950" end="00:11:54.210">scenario...we talked about earlier...they were trying to integrate with...this tool...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:54.210" end="00:11:56.530">I don't have that...on your phone.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:56.530" end="00:12:02.970">...that makes it, you know,...interesting scenario our next question what are the dependencies</p>
      <p begin="00:12:02.970" end="00:12:07.510">two-run visual studio code...today the.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:08.530" end="00:12:13.320">So, depending on what is that you want to write...rate straight</p>
      <p begin="00:12:13.320" end="00:12:17.920">...out-of-the-box on linux you don't have any dependencies if you want</p>
      <p begin="00:12:17.920" end="00:12:20.260">to know development and...debugging</p>
      <p begin="00:12:20.260" end="00:12:25.160">...hp dot net developments today you need to have more mono...</p>
      <p begin="00:12:25.160" end="00:12:30.980">zero dot one installed on the linux box and on the site and</p>
      <p begin="00:12:30.980" end="00:12:35.980">on...net site...very simple.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:35.980" end="00:12:38.490">...of scripts you can run to get that all installed</p>
      <p begin="00:12:38.490" end="00:12:43.640">onto linux machine dot net so the next question is what about</p>
      <p begin="00:12:43.640" end="00:12:48.870">rich...support I think that goes a little bit towards...talking about...three levels right now if</p>
      <p begin="00:12:48.870" end="00:12:54.940">...support is at the lowest-level...is...a single...deeper language</p>
      <p begin="00:12:54.940" end="00:12:59.490">understand so we can't wait till the open-door for extensibility and then of</p>
      <p begin="00:12:59.490" end="00:13:03.990">course people can add that and can help us to go one level got</p>
      <p begin="00:13:05.020" end="00:13:10.020">...you going to integrate cplus-plus and tellers sense into bs code that's an interesting question</p>
      <p begin="00:13:10.020" end="00:13:15.130">...roslyn visit work in the cplus-plus area now...is the managed code visual</p>
      <p begin="00:13:15.130" end="00:13:19.510">the behind and csharp so it's interesting right for csharp</p>
      <p begin="00:13:19.510" end="00:13:24.870">for cplus-plus there's a one of these and language changing similar offline...on</p>
      <p begin="00:13:24.870" end="00:13:30.070">...right and of course it would be nice scenario to use clang as this out of process</p>
      <p begin="00:13:30.070" end="00:13:34.570">...tocs well protocol and that's how you get that but again I guess we</p>
      <p begin="00:13:34.570" end="00:13:38.610">have to make first this the extension stores able that we can</p>
      <p begin="00:13:38.610" end="00:13:43.690">you might orders to help us on that but the...goes in this direction right you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:13:43.690" end="00:13:47.780">leverages language engines and for cplus-plus there is a good one out there</p>
      <p begin="00:13:47.780" end="00:13:52.320">so the next question can this compile the apps</p>
      <p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:57.230">...reference I download try to compile my store app?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:57.230" end="00:14:01.080">The question is there like...compile</p>
      <p begin="00:14:01.080" end="00:14:06.080">...certain kind of absent you're like you shouldn't really be working on inside...visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:14:06.080" end="00:14:11.080">code or is it really just editor what's the bloop look like for someone that's doing,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.080" end="00:14:16.080">for example, storehouse so for perhaps like this there's this to create?</p>
      <p begin="00:14:16.080" end="00:14:20.510">An enormous number of different types of projects...number of different</p>
      <p begin="00:14:20.510" end="00:14:26.310">dependencies and things that only run install on windows itself so it's challenge you say,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:26.310" end="00:14:29.890">yeah, you could open up any project in visual studio code on linux</p>
      <p begin="00:14:29.890" end="00:14:35.610">...is there's a lot of fundamental pieces that aren't there so what we have today is support for</p>
      <p begin="00:14:35.610" end="00:14:40.650">asp dot net the five applications...and we have support</p>
      <p begin="00:14:40.650" end="00:14:45.890">for...csharp applications and,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:45.890" end="00:14:49.320">that's the scope of what we...for manage code...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:49.320" end="00:14:54.620">cross-platform I see...that's interesting I mean it's good to know the boundary right?</p>
      <p begin="00:14:54.620" end="00:14:59.620">On windows its mean...code runs cross-platform also runs...windows if you got</p>
      <p begin="00:14:59.620" end="00:15:04.040">...store app...got all the tools installed visual studio you can certainly go</p>
      <p begin="00:15:04.040" end="00:15:07.060">to the consul on windows and run microsoft build</p>
      <p begin="00:15:07.060" end="00:15:09.950">...your application and do all that but you're not going to get</p>
      <p begin="00:15:09.950" end="00:15:13.340">...built-in support in the code environment for</p>
      <p begin="00:15:13.340" end="00:15:17.040">those project types now I guess it's good to know?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:20.520">What it's for and what that's good a good of demarcation</p>
      <p begin="00:15:20.520" end="00:15:25.330">...from our will you support sl and cs projects?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:25.330" end="00:15:30.840">So, this actually the whole...for csharp...and only show</p>

      <p begin="00:17:10.260" end="00:17:14.200">to see your take on it will visual studio code be open-source.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.260" end="00:17:18.460">...my answer is some of it is already opensource right views</p>
