      <p begin="00:00:08.250" end="00:00:14.460">and we ready to go all right we're ready to go hello, welcome, welcome I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.460" end="00:00:18.840">thrilled just absolutely thrilled to be here talking to you about nano server</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.050" end="00:00:23.680">...server is by far.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.680" end="00:00:26.670">The most important most significant change we</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.670" end="00:00:29.380">have made in server sense windows</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.380" end="00:00:33.660">and t so put your seat belts on kind of just show you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.660" end="00:00:38.410">this fantastic new server...is a cloud optimized server on</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.410" end="00:00:43.000">...snowbirds I'm a distinguish engineer and I'm the lead architect for windows server</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.000" end="00:00:47.750">and system center datacenter and joining me are management same principle pm</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.750" end="00:00:52.780">and windows server now here's the thing to realize all this work</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.780" end="00:00:57.600">here's the man this guy has been working on this so long you can really how</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:02.830">...about...years ten years now seriously we've been doing this at</p>
      <p begin="00:01:02.830" end="00:01:07.790">various stages it's taken the combination of ten years worth of effort</p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.790" end="00:01:11.450">...the whole thing...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.450" end="00:01:18.350">Is just...been twenty-year okay so ok so let's go ok, so, first of course a</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.350" end="00:01:23.310">valuations make sure you fill out your valuations we do pay attention of those things off, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:27.170">where that we do we read all the comments and we respond to</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.170" end="00:01:30.780">their we react to them...make improve based on</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:34.230">...so here's what we're...we're going to start off talking about</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.230" end="00:01:38.450">what we hear from our customers and we're very customer focused</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.450" end="00:01:42.940">...will talk about our server journey and then our cloud journey</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.940" end="00:01:48.290">then we'll get into some of the details about nano server show you some very</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.290" end="00:01:53.070">preliminary results these a preliminary results some of the numbers we have not which be</p>
      <p begin="00:01:53.070" end="00:01:56.780">clear...very early days with...server we have not</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.780" end="00:02:01.610">done a performance pass ok so some of these numbers</p>
      <p begin="00:02:01.610" end="00:02:05.610">will get better we're not done refactoring so some of the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:05.610" end="00:02:10.440">numbers might get a little worse I will also tell you that as we do this we're looking</p>
      <p begin="00:02:10.440" end="00:02:15.350">and saying hey maybe we should make corresponding changes to the other versions of our</p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.740" end="00:02:22.100">...persian and the other versions of server as well ...preliminary results</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.100" end="00:02:26.550">will tell you about...status our road map and then actions for you guys to go do</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.550" end="00:02:31.520">...also point out this talk is the developer focus talk</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.520" end="00:02:32.900">ok next week</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.900" end="00:02:38.420">...ignite we're doing a similar but different version of this talk focused in</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.420" end="00:02:40.080">...there's a bunch</p>
      <p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:45.480">of additional content that will be released in that talk so, what you want</p>
      <p begin="00:02:45.480" end="00:02:50.270">to do is you want pay attention that talk in particular we're going to be releasing a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:02:50.270" end="00:02:54.620">of our demos as videos on channel nine and we'll show you that coming up</p>
      <p begin="00:02:55.890" end="00:02:59.180">...so what we've been hearing from our customers really there's</p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.180" end="00:03:03.930">...big buckets three of them are on this slide so...cinepak my business why do I have to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.930" end="00:03:08.340">patching reboot something that's not being used on my servers one of reboot is required I want my</p>
      <p begin="00:03:08.340" end="00:03:13.060">machines back-up and servicing my customers as fast as possible and server</p>
      <p begin="00:03:13.060" end="00:03:17.920">images are too big so they take up too much space on the disk it takes a long-time to installing configured</p>
      <p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:23.120">takes a long-time to reboot takes a long-time to predeployed over the network</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:27.910">...infrastructure requires to many resources so my server operating system is using a lot of resources</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.910" end="00:03:32.320">...I could be on...reselling to my customers</p>
      <p begin="00:03:32.320" end="00:03:37.200">or could be providing more services within my organization and,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:37.200" end="00:03:41.270">the by limiting the amount of resources the operating system uses I can also increase my</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.270" end="00:03:46.770">vm density or run more containers based on your container functionality?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.770" end="00:03:50.820">The other area where we've really been hearing a...around security having more things</p>
      <p begin="00:03:50.820" end="00:03:55.730">installed things that I don't need obviously opens up...vectors for attackers and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:55.730" end="00:03:59.450">...headlines over the last year so all the different attacks that</p>
      <p begin="00:03:59.450" end="00:04:03.640">...major corporations and the second one from the bottom is pretty interesting,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.640" end="00:04:08.070">you know, someone hackers are attacking manufacturing companies now and actually causing physical damage</p>
      <p begin="00:04:08.070" end="00:04:13.030">their equipment within their plants...bowie sometimes we kind of customers have this idea of like</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.030" end="00:04:18.140">gold image with a install everything on it and then they give it to everyone and say, yeah, just ignore the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.140" end="00:04:22.970">...you'd want...if you're one of those people stop it that's a terrible idea</p>
      <p begin="00:04:22.970" end="00:04:28.460">don't do that so really what we're hearing is customers want just the components they need</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.460" end="00:04:32.230">and nothing more so let me installed just the pieces I need for the services I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:32.230" end="00:04:34.580">run that system don't give me like every sort of big</p>
      <p begin="00:04:34.580" end="00:04:41.290">gold image that has all of windows server installed on it when I just need a small subset.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.290" end="00:04:46.450">Ok, so, let's talk about our server journey so when we started here windows,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:46.450" end="00:04:51.420">windows nt, you know, really that we didn't draw distinction between what a desktop was and what a</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.420" end="00:04:55.320">server was right and the joke was we took a desktop and kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:55.320" end="00:04:59.020">...flipped over on its side in fact marker</p>
      <p begin="00:04:59.020" end="00:05:03.570">...you may not have heard of him he's an engineer that works at microsoft anyway, so,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:03.570" end="00:05:09.180">this guy name micros innovation fact was the guy who was became famous because he was the one</p>
      <p begin="00:05:09.180" end="00:05:13.430">that discovered hey there's only a different...between server and client</p>
      <p begin="00:05:13.430" end="00:05:18.120">is a registry key if you change into this you can get a server and...microsoft changed it</p>
      <p begin="00:05:18.120" end="00:05:22.840">...about hey now is this value so they played cat-and-mouse for a while but markers the guy</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.840" end="00:05:27.780">that discovered that at the time that was a great thing when the world was all about I want</p>
      <p begin="00:05:27.780" end="00:05:32.220">up to this server and...want to manage this server it was great worked</p>
      <p begin="00:05:32.220" end="00:05:37.840">out fantastically...is nice easy to managing cetera however admin</p>
      <p begin="00:05:37.840" end="00:05:42.530">...on servers are poison...heroine jan for</p>
      <p begin="00:05:42.530" end="00:05:46.780">...probably feels pretty good but you do...a bunch you life goes...you do-too-much</p>
      <p begin="00:05:46.780" end="00:05:51.870">you dad okay now...right so why is it wired admins on</p>
      <p begin="00:05:51.870" end="00:05:56.260">gooey so horrible and the answers this invariably,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56.260" end="00:05:59.480">invariably when you have a local admin gooey</p>
      <p begin="00:05:59.480" end="00:06:02.690">on a server you put the business logic in the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:02.690" end="00:06:08.140">gooey and you call private api...now what that really means is you don't</p>
      <p begin="00:06:08.140" end="00:06:11.830">have a good proper management api and you can't</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.830" end="00:06:16.800">do remote management and you can't do automation so as long as the world</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:21.560">...I have my server I walk up to that server and I do it the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:21.560" end="00:06:23.380">distinction is fine local gui</p>
      <p begin="00:06:23.380" end="00:06:28.240">for fantastic but that world was a long-time ago now it's about</p>
      <p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:33.160">datacenters now it's about agile development in the cloud and these local</p>
      <p begin="00:06:33.160" end="00:06:36.850">gooey...poison okay so want to get the local</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.850" end="00:06:41.730">gooey off so we started that really in server twenty-eight where we said hey now we have the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.730" end="00:06:46.300">...server core it doesn't have...sonnet at that point was separate</p>
      <p begin="00:06:46.300" end="00:06:50.590">installed server core or full server and we made some mistakes with this</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.590" end="00:06:54.790">right warm particularly clear about what scenarios really work well</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.790" end="00:06:58.980">...version one we didn't have...full and complete management story we</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.980" end="00:07:03.790">didn't have a lot of the features and roles running at when we first started</p>
      <p begin="00:07:03.790" end="00:07:08.200">of course that got fixed and really nailed it in windows server two thousand and twelve</p>
      <p begin="00:07:08.200" end="00:07:12.980">and rtwo we had improved our management story all the interesting</p>
      <p begin="00:07:12.980" end="00:07:17.600">roles and features are running on server core and you can choose server</p>
      <p begin="00:07:17.600" end="00:07:22.930">core or server with the gooey and if you made a mistake you can go back and forth and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:22.930" end="00:07:27.690">that was important because some of our ecosystem still had products that required to</p>
      <p begin="00:07:27.690" end="00:07:31.830">...to install and then you could take the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:31.830" end="00:07:36.400">...off and it would run just fine?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:36.400" end="00:07:39.960">So, now that's great now we talk about our cloud journey</p>
      <p begin="00:07:39.960" end="00:07:44.960">...so with our cloud journey here's the thing the understand in the context of measure.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:49.580">Patches are very disruptive right if I have the patch the host in ensure</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.580" end="00:07:51.810">...measure doesn't have live migration</p>
      <p begin="00:07:51.810" end="00:07:54.900">so if you patch the host guess what.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.900" end="00:07:58.880">Every vm needs to be restarted talk about business impact</p>
      <p begin="00:07:58.880" end="00:08:02.670">that's business impact next is hey you may or may not</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02.670" end="00:08:06.650">...turns out as you're pretty large really large</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.650" end="00:08:11.510">...lots and lots of server's we take a large number servers and you say well</p>
      <p begin="00:08:11.510" end="00:08:16.260">hey each one of those os is consumes a bunch of resources a bunch of resources times a bunch of</p>
      <p begin="00:08:16.260" end="00:08:21.170">...that translates to a large number clocks of course taking these large images and moving</p>
      <p begin="00:08:21.170" end="00:08:24.710">around the network consumes a lot of bandwidth that we'd rather be serving</p>
      <p begin="00:08:24.710" end="00:08:28.660">further people now as, you know, windows server has something called cloud</p>
      <p begin="00:08:28.660" end="00:08:34.110">platform solution comp platform solution is...a box one to</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.110" end="00:08:38.710">...racks so here we have live migration it's fantastic right so if I have</p>
      <p begin="00:08:38.710" end="00:08:43.670">the patch the host got no service interruption right you will</p>
      <p begin="00:08:43.670" end="00:08:48.050">...the m from one machine will patch that host will move them back and,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:48.050" end="00:08:53.520">iterate...ok button a for...system...thousand vm</p>
      <p begin="00:08:53.520" end="00:08:58.160">...to gigabytes each that means I'm live migrating sixteen</p>
      <p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:02.730">terabytes of data sixteen terabytes of data across the network that should</p>
      <p begin="00:09:02.730" end="00:09:06.560">otherwise be servicing customer needs so even well I don't have</p>
      <p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:11.200">service interruption I still have a pretty large service impact</p>
      <p begin="00:09:11.200" end="00:09:15.300">sorting getting at here is that the cloud really can't withstand</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.300" end="00:09:20.960">these interruptions right so ultimately what we concluded was that we needed a server</p>
      <p begin="00:09:20.960" end="00:09:27.800">configuration optimized for the cloud no means literally we</p>
      <p begin="00:09:27.800" end="00:09:29.650">need server configuration optimize</p>
      <p begin="00:09:29.650" end="00:09:35.910">...the cloud I'm pretty sure you needed as well but I know that we needed.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:35.910" end="00:09:40.440">And, that is what...server is yes so now...our next step in</p>
      <p begin="00:09:40.440" end="00:09:45.390">...journey so what is a new head...sixty four-bit only deployment option for windows</p>
      <p begin="00:09:45.390" end="00:09:49.380">server so back to jeffries comments about...being poison on</p>
      <p begin="00:09:49.380" end="00:09:53.480">the server it is have those there is no local log on a local interface to it</p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.480" end="00:09:57.720">there's no res intuit so you cannot terminal server intuit you have to</p>
      <p begin="00:09:57.720" end="00:10:02.210">...fully remote we'll talk about that it's more detail is sixty four-bit only again alps</p>
      <p begin="00:10:02.210" end="00:10:07.530">...the footprint and is part of windows server so there's a deep refactoring focused on a claudio</p>
      <p begin="00:10:07.530" end="00:10:09.670">...infrastructure and new-born the</p>
      <p begin="00:10:09.670" end="00:10:13.620">...applications that's worth pausing here would be really precise</p>
      <p begin="00:10:13.620" end="00:10:17.960">where early days and now server this is version one effectively and</p>

      <p begin="00:18:06.140" end="00:18:11.040">this why is that right so imagine you go and provision a system use say...a</p>
      <p begin="00:18:11.040" end="00:18:14.570">...like five hundred clicks later you got your system.</p>

      <p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:49.760">Ok,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:49.760" end="00:24:54.740">so, let's talk about the server application development ok so now the question is...I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:24:54.740" end="00:24:59.070">...developer and I...get the server thing in focus and now you bring</p>
      <p begin="00:24:59.070" end="00:25:03.580">up this nano server like how do I think about and then the question get a lot is like so do I</p>
      <p begin="00:25:03.580" end="00:25:06.560">coda containers are going to source code the...server</p>
      <p begin="00:25:06.560" end="00:25:11.470">or do I have to choose it's actually a very simple story ok so here's the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:11.470" end="00:25:16.450">model what we're doing is a deep refactoring of the server</p>
      <p begin="00:25:16.450" end="00:25:21.050">okay we start off with nano server that's the core elements</p>
      <p begin="00:25:21.050" end="00:25:25.040">on top of that is server now we call the server core</p>
      <p begin="00:25:25.040" end="00:25:29.170">...a missteps in this is the server because the other thing we used to say</p>
      <p begin="00:25:29.170" end="00:25:34.590">usu server core and there was something...call full server that...like a good thing right you</p>
      <p begin="00:25:34.590" end="00:25:39.030">...a server application services all why require full server you're like wow you</p>
      <p begin="00:25:39.030" end="00:25:44.440">must be great...create that men we tried to be clear about in the last version we said well</p>
      <p begin="00:25:44.440" end="00:25:48.990">no it's not full server its server with a gooey...we want</p>
      <p begin="00:25:48.990" end="00:25:53.110">to get even clearer the future name is going to be client?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:53.110" end="00:25:59.000">Okay, because that's really what it is a client stack running on a server...that's</p>
      <p begin="00:25:59.000" end="00:26:04.360">werner's...head that's what is to clients background on a server now there are times when you</p>
      <p begin="00:26:04.360" end="00:26:09.380">want have a client stack run on a server when are those the...is remote desktop</p>
      <p begin="00:26:09.380" end="00:26:13.350">raw desktop is a client stack running on a server so they're left definitely</p>
      <p begin="00:26:13.350" end="00:26:18.160">legitimate cases for this but most server applications should not be used in</p>
      <p begin="00:26:18.160" end="00:26:23.110">...client stack on a server at all ok so the model is going to be</p>
      <p begin="00:26:23.110" end="00:26:26.310">that is a developer I code to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:26.310" end="00:26:31.590">a server or nano server...bring up visual studio and I'm going to pick these, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:31.590" end="00:26:34.920">...just say I want mail server one full server.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:34.920" end="00:26:39.680">Your nad...code to the client...not for-you server guys</p>
      <p begin="00:26:39.680" end="00:26:44.040">...the client guys go put that on a client...server.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:44.040" end="00:26:48.790">Next so developer targets server for compatibility or nano server for</p>
      <p begin="00:26:48.790" end="00:26:52.330">...optimization and then they hit f five they get</p>
      <p begin="00:26:52.330" end="00:26:56.790">...now they have to deploy the expedia run it and here's where it</p>
      <p begin="00:26:56.790" end="00:27:01.860">becomes very simple you pick which one you wanted server now server you get your</p>
      <p begin="00:27:01.860" end="00:27:08.000">exes venue deploy it on a physical server</p>
      <p begin="00:27:08.000" end="00:27:10.900">Or...container windows server</p>
      <p begin="00:27:10.900" end="00:27:14.850">...hyper v container okay so it's very simple story.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:14.850" end="00:27:16.790">A server and nano server</p>
      <p begin="00:27:16.790" end="00:27:21.250">are set of api and components and then they run somewhere they run on a</p>
      <p begin="00:27:21.250" end="00:27:26.950">physical machine they run out of virtual machine they run a container that's...</p>
      <p begin="00:27:26.950" end="00:27:30.100">And, one thing to point out there this that the client-server does not run in</p>
      <p begin="00:27:30.100" end="00:27:35.070">the container neumann physical virtual thank you that's one of a container, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:35.070" end="00:27:38.870">so, we've been pretty pointy here so, if you</p>
      <p begin="00:27:38.870" end="00:27:41.130">get a server application that uses some of those</p>
      <p begin="00:27:41.130" end="00:27:48.780">client api is the ain't running containers so stop that practice.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:48.780" end="00:27:54.080">Okay,...now we got a...somehow here we're going to show you is asp dot net five</p>

      <p begin="00:38:37.020" end="00:38:42.160">the to build of windows server that's coming out soon doesn't have all the reverse order worked</p>
      <p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:47.140">on it the next technical preview after this formal have even more of that but if you are working with your</p>
      <p begin="00:38:47.140" end="00:38:51.270">total national server and you come across some api is that you think would be useful to have</p>
      <p begin="00:38:51.270" end="00:38:55.520">a reverse order for there's an email address at the end of the presentations send</p>

      <p begin="00:39:01.020" end="00:39:05.550">yeah, so, it's worth pointing out how we develop now server so we did was we started</p>
      <p begin="00:39:05.550" end="00:39:10.130">...the very smallest component that could run and then we did was we</p>
      <p begin="00:39:10.130" end="00:39:15.090">pick the scenarios that we wanted to run and then we figured out what api need to be re</p>
      <p begin="00:39:15.090" end="00:39:20.730">factored to support those scenarios and then we did the next scenario and the next</p>
      <p begin="00:39:20.730" end="00:39:25.410">...next scenario that's why we're so clear about the scenarios</p>
      <p begin="00:39:25.410" end="00:39:27.100">the version one supports</p>

      <p begin="00:39:35.740" end="00:39:39.940">As you go and take your applications and get them on nano server as you</p>
      <p begin="00:39:39.940" end="00:39:44.930">encounter problems we'd like to hear about it so we can decide hey are those part of the</p>
      <p begin="00:39:44.930" end="00:39:49.790">snares we want to focus on version one and if so then we'll find out those api</p>
      <p begin="00:39:49.790" end="00:39:53.040">...an will refactoring them if those are scenarios that</p>
      <p begin="00:39:53.040" end="00:39:58.330">were not targeting for version one will say perhaps later put in the backlog</p>
      <p begin="00:39:58.330" end="00:40:02.760">in the backlog yes so that's one of the big differences with server core announcer</p>
      <p begin="00:40:02.760" end="00:40:07.610">with server core we try to play and plug into everything that existed out there</p>
      <p begin="00:40:07.610" end="00:40:12.390">...ecosystem of windows server with nano server with a much harder line say we've got this dividing</p>
      <p begin="00:40:12.390" end="00:40:15.650">line only certain things are going to be functional...when I'm just going</p>
      <p begin="00:40:15.650" end="00:40:20.420">...stuff and just to let it play with what exists today.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:20.420" end="00:40:24.820">So, two-point-one...reversed orders is they do not eliminate the need for to</p>

      <p begin="00:40:27.080" end="00:40:31.290">...hiv doesn't exist in now server and it's not something we can refactoring bring in</p>

      <p begin="00:46:10.980" end="00:46:16.370">an be decide we've become a great enterprise server that was at a time when, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:16.370" end="00:46:21.720">somebody said that the defining user experience of the desktop was something called the blue screen of death</p>

      <p begin="00:46:24.230" end="00:46:29.200">...last time you saw blue screen a death right they happen but they're pretty rare and why is</p>
      <p begin="00:46:29.200" end="00:46:33.220">it was because our investments in the server benefited</p>

      <p begin="00:47:46.700" end="00:47:49.370">So, the sporty task we're going to have...for files</p>
      <p begin="00:47:49.370" end="00:47:52.890">...creatively folders...files</p>
      <p begin="00:47:52.890" end="00:48:03.700">set permissions hormones will have services support...configure start delete.</p>

      <p begin="00:48:11.110" end="00:48:16.370">...that registration which is a custom action...today so focused on the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:16.370" end="00:48:21.370">scenarios we believer needed to install code on nano server but again if there's functional in here that you need to install</p>
      <p begin="00:48:21.370" end="00:48:24.740">...these for this normal-looking and just be clear</p>
      <p begin="00:48:24.740" end="00:48:28.720">...distinction between installation configuration turns out</p>
      <p begin="00:48:28.720" end="00:48:33.120">that a lot of the problem is when you get those two things confused you want</p>
      <p begin="00:48:33.120" end="00:48:35.220">to install something and then you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:48:35.220" end="00:48:40.210">...those different things and you can start using this or x copy and then</p>
      <p begin="00:48:40.210" end="00:48:47.490">you can figure out with things like desired state configuration directly?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:47.490" end="00:48:50.970">So, talked about a lot of stuff at all sounds very exciting</p>
      <p begin="00:48:50.970" end="00:48:55.450">...mention we talk about some preliminary results these early numbers again things may change</p>
      <p begin="00:48:55.450" end="00:48:59.940">as we keep evolving the system and some of the things we refined and make better</p>
      <p begin="00:48:59.940" end="00:49:04.080">...may make server core better as well which would be...but,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:04.080" end="00:49:08.160">some of these numbers may change so how are we doing with all this stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:49:08.160" end="00:49:12.610">we're talking about so first is we're going look at servicing and this is all the patches</p>
      <p begin="00:49:12.610" end="00:49:15.100">released during twenty fourteen software</p>
      <p begin="00:49:15.100" end="00:49:19.510">...available throughout the year of two thousand fourteen how to compare with</p>
      <p begin="00:49:19.510" end="00:49:24.990">server core and the server with aggression just be clear we did decode analysis of every single</p>
      <p begin="00:49:24.990" end="00:49:29.110">...fourteen and then we...to the code base and said does that code base</p>
      <p begin="00:49:29.110" end="00:49:33.960">existent nano server so basically we did the right way there's no gamesmanship</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.960" end="00:49:39.640">going here so now server would have...nine important bulletins compared to...</p>
      <p begin="00:49:39.640" end="00:49:44.510">for server core and twenty-six for full server so critical</p>
      <p begin="00:49:44.510" end="00:49:48.160">bolton is even more interesting it's only two critical bulletins for</p>
      <p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:52.030">a whole year for nano server so record eight...around...</p>
      <p begin="00:49:53.070" end="00:49:58.730">To this and...the number of removes three routes holier.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:58.730" end="00:50:00.740">So, record had six full</p>
      <p begin="00:50:00.740" end="00:50:05.570">server would have eleven so you would have only been able to skip one month's worth of reboot so you can see that greatly</p>
      <p begin="00:50:05.570" end="00:50:10.550">increases your up time and we still want to do some more work we really want to get those to a maximum of to reboot</p>
      <p begin="00:50:10.550" end="00:50:14.580">...year fernando server.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:14.580" end="00:50:19.970">The security side so the...we haven't done a lot in this area it's slower seventy-three compared</p>
      <p begin="00:50:19.970" end="00:50:22.190">...ninety-eight.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:22.190" end="00:50:26.490">...services running twenty-two versus forty-six so a little less than half.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:26.490" end="00:50:29.600">Ports open twelve versus thirty one's a little more than a third</p>
      <p begin="00:50:29.600" end="00:50:33.250">...significantly reduce the number of services imports those attack</p>
      <p begin="00:50:33.250" end="00:50:38.570">vectors that all those hackers we talked about earlier love to try and access.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:38.570" end="00:50:41.860">Resource utilization so process counts twenty-one versus twenty six</p>
      <p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:46.810">...hundred-fifty megabytes versus two hundred fifty five megabytes</p>
      <p begin="00:50:46.810" end="00:50:55.290">we actually have a nano server on old tower machine...booting in fifteen seconds.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:55.290" end="00:50:57.810">Kernel memory...sixty-one megabytes version hundred</p>
      <p begin="00:50:57.810" end="00:51:04.870">thirty-nine about half that's less than half my friend I know.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:04.870" end="00:51:08.340">So, deployment improvements this is very interesting along with</p>
      <p begin="00:51:08.340" end="00:51:13.120">the patches so from starting the deployment process to fully provisions</p>
      <p begin="00:51:13.120" end="00:51:17.870">...accessible...the network nano server forty seconds that so in the computer</p>
      <p begin="00:51:17.870" end="00:51:22.700">and indeed api to address up and running and accessible server core took five</p>
      <p begin="00:51:22.700" end="00:51:27.560">minutes so we also have a set-up and it's a demo that will get up on channel nine...</p>
      <p begin="00:51:27.560" end="00:51:32.370">night of...including announcer machine and this onto old tower machines will</p>
      <p begin="00:51:32.370" end="00:51:37.850">hundred megabyte switch now server takes three minutes to deploy from starting</p>
      <p begin="00:51:37.850" end="00:51:41.870">...you process to upping fully provisions and that's on...hundred megabytes which</p>
      <p begin="00:51:41.870" end="00:51:46.620">was some old hardware...a datacenter environment you'll get that even faster.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:46.620" end="00:51:50.970">We did the same thing with server core the same equipment nineteen minutes so the</p>
      <p begin="00:51:50.970" end="00:51:55.510">nano server time actually if you we've done some analysis a lot of times actually spent topping</p>
      <p begin="00:51:55.510" end="00:52:00.570">...over so we gotta do something there but.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:00.570" end="00:52:03.920">And, this footprints this word is really so now servers</p>
      <p begin="00:52:03.920" end="00:52:14.240">four hundred megabytes compared to almost five gigabytes for server core.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:14.240" end="00:52:18.980">Wait for it and then on the bhd five there's a little bit overhead...the</p>
      <p begin="00:52:18.980" end="00:52:21.010">...you can...goes from four point</p>
      <p begin="00:52:21.010" end="00:52:26.780">eight six-point-three announcer goes from four hundred four hundred ten so great</p>
      <p begin="00:52:26.780" end="00:52:31.660">improvement in footprint back to the commons were making earlier about the smaller installation size</p>
      <p begin="00:52:31.660" end="00:52:34.860">...faster reboot all of that were...there,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:34.860" end="00:52:39.380">yeah, so, what I like to tell people at this point is you just saw those numbers pretty</p>
      <p begin="00:52:39.380" end="00:52:45.010">stunning numbers the next time you have somebody and developer and admin say well, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:45.010" end="00:52:49.830">I really don't want it seen convenient to learn our shell I really don't like local</p>
      <p begin="00:52:49.830" end="00:52:56.290">remote gooey ways think back at these numbers and then look at that person and say?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:56.290" end="00:52:59.120">Is that person really worth four times as many</p>
      <p begin="00:52:59.120" end="00:53:03.630">...that much extra resource consumption and that much extra</p>
      <p begin="00:53:03.630" end="00:53:12.240">time and...answer might bs?</p>
      <p begin="00:53:12.240" end="00:53:18.150">So, now server windows overview next will be...installation option much like server core.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:18.150" end="00:53:22.970">Will not be listed in setup with nano server you do</p>
      <p begin="00:53:22.970" end="00:53:26.970">while the ways we get so small is you have to put the...and there's no plug-and-play</p>
      <p begin="00:53:26.970" end="00:53:31.530">are user mode plug-and-play and nano service kernel mode so it's not going to often detect what</p>
      <p begin="00:53:31.530" end="00:53:36.190">drivers are in our what...required for...particular hardware you have to inject the</p>

      <p begin="00:53:40.940" end="00:53:46.200">...basically installing a brick it is a separate image that you have to customize before deploy</p>
      <p begin="00:53:46.200" end="00:53:51.190">...was in a separate full-grown media and under that there's a packages some folder in</p>

      <p begin="00:53:56.140" end="00:54:00.500">...you can do that or you can customize and just pick the...specific your hardware and have a</p>
      <p begin="00:54:00.500" end="00:54:06.270">...small and tight image it will be available next server released been released</p>
      <p begin="00:54:06.270" end="00:54:08.580">...as part of ignite and build and</p>
      <p begin="00:54:08.580" end="00:54:14.070">...follow-on technical previews so we're going to get a guide upon technet on how you can work with</p>
      <p begin="00:54:14.070" end="00:54:18.360">...server how you can do not management through powers overloading and all</p>
      <p begin="00:54:18.360" end="00:54:22.330">the information on how to inject...and...so...all coming,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:22.330" end="00:54:25.730">yeah, and, it's worth again remind mining you that were very early days with</p>
      <p begin="00:54:25.730" end="00:54:29.020">nano server so when you get edge, you know, you're going to have to read the released</p>
      <p begin="00:54:29.020" end="00:54:34.600">...and have some struggles but we'll have some fa...out there some video demos but,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:34.600" end="00:54:45.160">obviously each release are become more polished?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:45.160" end="00:54:49.530">Okay, so, the roadmap so nano server is the future of windows</p>
      <p begin="00:54:49.530" end="00:54:50.030">server.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:51.080" end="00:54:52.010">Version one</p>
      <p begin="00:54:52.010" end="00:54:56.970">we're starting focused in on these cloud scenarios okay and then, you</p>
      <p begin="00:54:56.970" end="00:55:01.070">know, there's...server and is born in the cloud applications but,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:01.070" end="00:55:05.140">it's really the foundation for all the components going forward we want</p>
      <p begin="00:55:05.140" end="00:55:08.530">a model of just enough os so if you</p>
      <p begin="00:55:08.530" end="00:55:12.860">...an application...you need five gigabytes...a...great</p>
      <p begin="00:55:12.860" end="00:55:17.820">...of five gigabytes exponents but shouldn't have ten and if you only want</p>
      <p begin="00:55:17.820" end="00:55:22.690">nine hundred megabytes...have nine hundred megabytes so you'll see that claudio</p>
      <p begin="00:55:22.690" end="00:55:27.000">and net nano server starting off with the cloud scenarios is a</p>
      <p begin="00:55:27.000" end="00:55:31.890">first step to a fully compositional factored operating</p>
      <p begin="00:55:31.890" end="00:55:36.490">system where you get the components that you want and we'll keep moving rolls over to</p>
      <p begin="00:55:36.490" end="00:55:39.030">...server so if you have particular roles are important,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:39.030" end="00:55:43.240">... we're collecting feedback...to prioritize what we go after next after hyper</p>
      <p begin="00:55:43.240" end="00:55:50.230">...and file server so you just the things you want as long as you want the right things?</p>
      <p begin="00:55:50.230" end="00:55:54.100">That's...don't require during exactly as long as it doesn't require</p>
