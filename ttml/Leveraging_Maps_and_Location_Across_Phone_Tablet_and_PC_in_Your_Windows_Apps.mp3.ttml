      <p begin="00:01:23.720" end="00:01:27.050">the street-side imagery that we have.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.050" end="00:01:30.640">To get to that app we will go over the basic features that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.640" end="00:01:35.350">the maps platform on windows has to offer and we'll also look</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.350" end="00:01:40.190">at how your feedback has influenced the product and how your feedback has</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.190" end="00:01:45.010">includes the platform features that we have introduce in windows?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.010" end="00:01:49.610">Before we get into talking about the features in windows and,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.610" end="00:01:55.030">the platform I wanted...talk about what does...backed off often</p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.030" end="00:02:01.030">prop work on the end-user...a biggest impact that we had in windows eight-point</p>
      <p begin="00:02:01.030" end="00:02:06.620">one we had seven different apps with seven different features and functionality on</p>
      <p begin="00:02:06.620" end="00:02:11.150">a variety of devices catering to a bunch of different experiences the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.150" end="00:02:15.420">user had to choose and pick from these apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.420" end="00:02:20.400">In windows stand we've combined all these seven different apps and functionalities</p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:22.020">to one single powerful</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.020" end="00:02:25.920">app that works seamlessly across phone tablets and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.920" end="00:02:29.180">...and the windows devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:29.180" end="00:02:33.630">This is an important thing the one thing that we have to note out</p>
      <p begin="00:02:33.630" end="00:02:38.380">here is this maps app is built on top of the...maps platform</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.380" end="00:02:42.990">...is available to developers as you might have seen all throughout the day and other previous eml</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.990" end="00:02:47.840">tocs how we are building on top of the same platform that we're giving to you map</p>
      <p begin="00:02:47.840" end="00:02:55.310">platform...the same thing a default windows maps app uses the same maps platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:55.310" end="00:02:57.420">So, what are the different</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.420" end="00:03:01.000">features and challenges of that we had in the maps platform?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:02.020" end="00:03:06.950">As we know in windows phone fiat you relied heavily on the here location platform</p>
      <p begin="00:03:06.950" end="00:03:12.430">...desktop side of things relied on the bing so, map services.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.430" end="00:03:15.440">We don't really want to make this as part of your</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.440" end="00:03:17.800">...so as maps platform</p>
      <p begin="00:03:17.800" end="00:03:22.800">we've combined all the features and functionalities from the to services and combine them into</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:27.600">one maps platform so you can start using it from one place.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.600" end="00:03:29.340">To features include a basic</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29.340" end="00:03:34.640">two-d map that you can display the basic canvas instead of a map control instead of</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.640" end="00:03:41.280">your map app you can customize the information that you want to display in the map.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:45.910">...transit traffic information then obviously you want to put your</p>
      <p begin="00:03:45.910" end="00:03:50.260">own push...and...on your own custom data on top of</p>
      <p begin="00:03:50.260" end="00:03:54.210">the map we have that feature for you then you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:54.210" end="00:03:59.710">display you want to be location wave and you want you want to define regions so</p>
      <p begin="00:03:59.710" end="00:04:03.980">that when the user enters a certain region or when...use...region you</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.980" end="00:04:08.400">get events we have those api and features for-you?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:12.210">Node that code...on windows devices uses the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.210" end="00:04:17.760">same geo fencing services that are offered...in the map platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:17.760" end="00:04:22.350">Then we have some advanced features and functionalities like routing we provide you</p>
      <p begin="00:04:22.350" end="00:04:25.920">...from point a to point b we can provide you driving route and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:25.920" end="00:04:30.250">...can for-you walking round we can make the...to the...demise...</p>
      <p begin="00:04:30.250" end="00:04:36.080">for your restrictions let's say you want to...you want all-white highways you can do that.</p>

      <p begin="00:04:39.170" end="00:04:45.120">four-time versus distance and optimized for graphic so on these are features that...already part of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.120" end="00:04:49.870">windows phone eight but along the way we have taken feedback and we've improved them and</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.870" end="00:04:55.550">...made improve part of the windows...maps platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:55.550" end="00:04:58.760">Now we're getting into some of the new and exciting stuff.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:58.760" end="00:05:03.650">For the first-time in this release we are introducing offline map support for desktops and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:03.650" end="00:05:05.860">tablet.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:05.860" end="00:05:08.120">This means that we have a system-wide</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.120" end="00:05:12.520">offline map setting once the user downloads a map offline</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12.520" end="00:05:17.340">on the device is available for all of the apps on the device.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:17.340" end="00:05:22.200">Develop a variety of scenarios that coming to mind when it comes to offline maps...so you have a</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.200" end="00:05:26.080">backed backpacking trip to europe and you want to...and,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:31.000">maintain a travel journal you can do that using offline maps you carry your offline not but</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31.000" end="00:05:35.980">you've got your surface...with you and you can you can blog about it but you cannot be uploaded to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.980" end="00:05:39.240">the into an obviously but you could...so you can later</p>
      <p begin="00:05:39.240" end="00:05:44.970">...travel journal the bunch of scenarios that come to mind when it comes offline maps.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:44.970" end="00:05:46.740">Next...provide and give you the rich</p>
      <p begin="00:05:46.740" end="00:05:51.840">street-side capabilities this is the first-time interesting street-side capabilities on phone that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:51.840" end="00:05:55.470">...you have you can now go on and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:55.470" end="00:05:59.230">...street-side which is the view of the street</p>
      <p begin="00:05:59.230" end="00:06:04.060">...a given lat long at the given camera angle you can customize it and you can displayed as part of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.060" end="00:06:09.450">your app then obviously we're going to give you the three-d that I open web we have the three-d capabilities</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.450" end="00:06:13.350">of which is on...tablets and bcs</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.350" end="00:06:16.590">...big so think about the scenarios are capable out</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.590" end="00:06:20.400">here imagine now that I trouble too close you key</p>
      <p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:24.730">...and I troubled my wife and I...the sophie of me mobile with the building</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24.730" end="00:06:28.830">ascended to mammal she has a windows device you open the picture and,...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:28.830" end="00:06:33.640">this is a picture of me traveling but imagine absence scenarios where</p>
      <p begin="00:06:33.640" end="00:06:38.430">now you can have instant panorama of these three-d buildings that I can send to my mom</p>
      <p begin="00:06:38.430" end="00:06:42.160">along with the picture she can really relate to where I am and what I have</p>
      <p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:47.130">traveled this amazing so we'll see how you can customize and use...sort of things</p>
      <p begin="00:06:48.210" end="00:06:52.290">...obviously these features...built on top of the windows universal</p>
      <p begin="00:06:52.290" end="00:06:56.830">...universal windows platform which means these are adaptive</p>
      <p begin="00:06:56.830" end="00:07:01.190">across different device screens and device sizes and resolutions these</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.190" end="00:07:06.740">adapt to different input types like mouse keyboard and touch?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:06.740" end="00:07:12.320">And, this one binding that you can run and apply we'll see how we...today.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:12.320" end="00:07:18.330">So, this is good these are all the features you have what are the api...that...we can take a look at.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.330" end="00:07:22.050">So, you have different map location services</p>
      <p begin="00:07:22.050" end="00:07:25.450">rate so you need to have two different service authentication</p>
      <p begin="00:07:25.450" end="00:07:29.950">...you need to have two different service tokens so will point you...different websites</p>
      <p begin="00:07:29.950" end="00:07:34.490">for it no we have done all the hard work to make sure</p>
      <p begin="00:07:34.490" end="00:07:38.070">...unify all the authentication framework into one</p>
      <p begin="00:07:38.070" end="00:07:42.680">place...all you have to do is you go to one place bing naps portal</p>
      <p begin="00:07:42.680" end="00:07:46.880">selected drop down universal windows platform and you get a service token that</p>
      <p begin="00:07:46.880" end="00:07:49.970">...use in your app and...just this in your</p>
      <p begin="00:07:49.970" end="00:07:54.680">...in your app before you put it on the store.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.680" end="00:07:59.690">We have this is this slide is basically going to cover the things that you can search</p>
      <p begin="00:07:59.690" end="00:08:03.470">on look for get started on we had the name space windows you</p>
      <p begin="00:08:03.470" end="00:08:07.170">...controls maps this where you'll find all the view or the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:07.170" end="00:08:12.030">widely that things when it comes to the map control includes the basic map control that you...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:12.030" end="00:08:16.540">sample includes map elements these are things that you can embed instead of</p>
      <p begin="00:08:16.540" end="00:08:21.310">your map control map elements can be of three different types map</p>
      <p begin="00:08:21.310" end="00:08:26.120">icons map poly lines and map polygons these are things you can</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26.120" end="00:08:32.010">embed inside of your map...then we have this good old sample</p>
      <p begin="00:08:32.010" end="00:08:36.760">that you can put on top of the map and you can assign it a location and...the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:36.760" end="00:08:41.050">...displayed on your map you can also completely</p>
      <p begin="00:08:41.050" end="00:08:45.410">...on the map control using the map by sources or you can overlay</p>
      <p begin="00:08:45.410" end="00:08:49.910">or own tiles on top of the map control this is very common in</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.910" end="00:08:56.180">whether scenarios and, a lot of people have been using it as a very common scenario for map</p>
      <p begin="00:08:56.180" end="00:09:02.200">bias makes you want location so we have a windows devices start geo location</p>
      <p begin="00:09:02.200" end="00:09:05.210">...this is where you get the location and</p>
      <p begin="00:09:05.210" end="00:09:09.550">you fencing services there's a talk earlier talking about background</p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.550" end="00:09:14.700">task how you can access geo location in the background I think it was by...so check it out if you</p>
      <p begin="00:09:14.700" end="00:09:20.980">...figure out onlineyou'll get more information how to access...the background.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:20.980" end="00:09:24.410">Then we have other head less routing services or other</p>
      <p begin="00:09:24.410" end="00:09:26.930">...map services that you can include</p>
      <p begin="00:09:26.930" end="00:09:31.170">...can use this includes the location finder this is for geo coding and</p>
      <p begin="00:09:31.170" end="00:09:33.100">...geo coding.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.100" end="00:09:35.310">We have mapped out finder service this is</p>
      <p begin="00:09:35.310" end="00:09:40.020">...gives you route from pointy to...to see to ds one.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:40.020" end="00:09:43.200">Then this part is my favorite we have.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:43.200" end="00:09:47.140">The uri scheme I say this my...because with</p>
      <p begin="00:09:47.140" end="00:09:51.320">...of code you launched existing maps abbott's a default maps app you</p>
      <p begin="00:09:51.320" end="00:09:56.140">possum the parameters you want and...complete your...scenario, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:56.140" end="00:09:59.310">let's say you...directions you want to give user directions you</p>
      <p begin="00:09:59.310" end="00:10:05.190">are restaurant app and you don't really care about getting directions included in your...you want to do is</p>
      <p begin="00:10:05.190" end="00:10:10.190">...to give the user the direction for that you just compose your uri scheme and</p>
      <p begin="00:10:10.190" end="00:10:16.970">you build it and then you launch the uri and now you...in the maps app and user gets what they want.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:16.970" end="00:10:19.660">Let's go over the basics of map control.</p>

      <p begin="00:17:21.330" end="00:17:26.520">Is very...to san-francisco...notice that there's a lot of movies that are shot</p>
      <p begin="00:17:26.520" end="00:17:30.770">in san francisco there's a bunch of locations...san-francisco it has a</p>
      <p begin="00:17:30.770" end="00:17:35.910">lot of culture and a lot of movies want to take advantage of that so,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:35.910" end="00:17:40.420">what we did was we found a data source which provides says with all the locations</p>

      <p begin="00:18:19.580" end="00:18:23.050">Let's go the basic sample so in the basic sample this is</p>
      <p begin="00:18:23.050" end="00:18:27.190">the sample that we have shipped with a is...out and,</p>

      <p begin="00:18:29.970" end="00:18:34.890">samples that we have in this casewhat I'm doing is I have three different sliders and data binding it</p>
      <p begin="00:18:34.890" end="00:18:38.920">to different properties on the map control I have a few check boxes which</p>
      <p begin="00:18:38.920" end="00:18:42.830">helped me customize the map and, the sample is very basic the</p>
      <p begin="00:18:42.830" end="00:18:47.790">...is very straightforward and simple for you to go play with...a bunch of different scenarios and,</p>

      <p begin="00:19:05.830" end="00:19:11.090">...so the because this is a universal windows platform app.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:11.090" end="00:19:13.050">It will run seamlessly across phone tablets and</p>
      <p begin="00:19:13.050" end="00:19:25.240">pc's the same the same sample works on the on the phone as well.</p>

      <p begin="00:21:10.910" end="00:21:15.940">So, as you can see we have a lot ofmovies...the downtown san francisco and</p>
      <p begin="00:21:15.940" end="00:21:22.520">...displaying that very easily on the map the next thing that I want to do is.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:22.520" end="00:21:26.950">When you click on one of these cameras are the map icons I</p>
      <p begin="00:21:26.950" end="00:21:31.570">want to display some extra information that we had images on file...the title and all</p>
      <p begin="00:21:31.570" end="00:21:35.960">those things so for that I've created a basic users control?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:35.960" end="00:21:40.000">And, in this user control I have a text login list</p>
      <p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:45.660">view and displaying information about the movie as you can see it's the same example that we all know</p>
      <p begin="00:21:45.660" end="00:21:50.590">...about bind it to use data mining and everything I also have a couple of buttons in</p>
      <p begin="00:21:50.590" end="00:21:54.480">their which add the movie location to the to the itinerary and which removes</p>
      <p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:22:04.900">...location from the identity let's look at the...click event handler?</p>
      <p begin="00:22:04.900" end="00:22:08.540">For the yeah, ad...have adverb,...</p>
      <p begin="00:22:08.540" end="00:22:12.560">so, in the advert click...handler so this is interesting rate I mean I had</p>
      <p begin="00:22:12.560" end="00:22:17.230">geo point and I want I want to display the information for the users instead of</p>
      <p begin="00:22:17.230" end="00:22:21.670">displaying just a lat long they don't really know that lapped law don't real physical address</p>
      <p begin="00:22:21.670" end="00:22:26.390">...don't even know that but I want to show them the real physical address for that I'm using</p>
      <p begin="00:22:26.390" end="00:22:30.070">reverse your coding this is one of the...aps that we have the</p>
      <p begin="00:22:30.070" end="00:22:35.050">mapped location finder service and the map location finder service I...geo point</p>
      <p begin="00:22:35.050" end="00:22:39.980">...get...address...use that formatted address I put in</p>
      <p begin="00:22:39.980" end="00:22:44.970">mike selected itinerary collection that I have a movie manager class and I</p>
      <p begin="00:22:44.970" end="00:22:50.890">build my...identity for the user so now I have my user control already and</p>
      <p begin="00:22:50.890" end="00:22:53.780">it is isset I want to display it</p>
      <p begin="00:22:53.780" end="00:22:58.680">onto the map as remember I how to add the sample to the</p>
      <p begin="00:22:58.680" end="00:23:04.570">map I instantiate the user control in my code behind for the main page.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:04.570" end="00:23:09.530">I attach it to the location which are received from the map element click event and</p>
      <p begin="00:23:09.530" end="00:23:14.130">...to the children collection and I display the map the</p>
      <p begin="00:23:14.130" end="00:23:18.950">...on the map that's run this so as you will see you when you click on one of</p>
      <p begin="00:23:18.950" end="00:23:24.000">these things they will one of these locations you will get a nice-looking</p>
      <p begin="00:23:24.000" end="00:23:29.480">flat-out decent looking...maybe you can do better design java.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:29.480" end="00:23:32.320">So, you have the movie let's add a</p>
      <p begin="00:23:32.320" end="00:23:36.170">and cvs added on the left-hand side I see the formatted address</p>
      <p begin="00:23:36.170" end="00:23:40.000">and displays a formatted address in the list collection of</p>
      <p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:42.830">...so after this point what we did was we did some usability</p>
      <p begin="00:23:42.830" end="00:23:47.320">studies and we saw people cringe...the number of icons are visible on the map</p>
      <p begin="00:23:47.320" end="00:23:51.240">control so we wanted to a cluster</p>
      <p begin="00:23:51.240" end="00:23:55.090">these icons into sort of cluster which will give users a</p>
      <p begin="00:23:55.090" end="00:23:59.310">more cleaner looking view of the map control so, I want</p>
      <p begin="00:23:59.310" end="00:24:03.700">...the hallways I shopped around with my dad lives in the hallways and I talked to people</p>
      <p begin="00:24:03.700" end="00:24:09.870">hey is that it does anyone have a cluster library that I can use I found a</p>
      <p begin="00:24:09.870" end="00:24:14.660">...other friends who had cluster library and that source code is in the cluster library</p>
      <p begin="00:24:14.660" end="00:24:19.570">for I didn't really know how that works but I knew how to call it so</p>
      <p begin="00:24:19.570" end="00:24:24.920">I went ahead and instantiated the cluster library bypassed in</p>
      <p begin="00:24:24.920" end="00:24:30.140">all my movies all the movies that I have I created the cluster every this course is</p>
      <p begin="00:24:30.140" end="00:24:35.860">available for you can download that's a nice clustering library that you can use and,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:35.860" end="00:24:41.850">I also...a converter it needs a converter to know what to look for</p>
      <p begin="00:24:41.850" end="00:24:46.030">...the in the class and how to compare and then I have a</p>
      <p begin="00:24:46.030" end="00:24:50.920">method called refresh map icons so in the refresh map icons I will it</p>
      <p begin="00:24:50.920" end="00:24:55.800">read through the clusters and I will...create the map icons...displayed at</p>
      <p begin="00:24:55.800" end="00:25:00.620">different levels...going through the entire method I'll...look at one of the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:00.620" end="00:25:05.170">codes length so in this one what I have is I look to the cluster</p>
      <p begin="00:25:05.170" end="00:25:10.420">look at the number of elements of...in the cluster and depending on that as select</p>
      <p begin="00:25:10.420" end="00:25:12.840">...image that I want to display?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:12.840" end="00:25:16.910">Then I add the map icon to the collection so this is a</p>
      <p begin="00:25:16.910" end="00:25:22.710">very basic clustering...let's run this and see how that how that looks.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:22.710" end="00:25:26.510">So, this time I'm hoping that...the users will</p>
      <p begin="00:25:26.510" end="00:25:28.680">...bit better.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:28.680" end="00:25:33.570">So, as you can see now this is a little bit more clear and clusters are better</p>
      <p begin="00:25:33.570" end="00:25:38.740">and the displayed the little flashed you're seeing that's known issue it's</p>
      <p begin="00:25:38.740" end="00:25:43.320">...the next flight item if...notice that flash so,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:43.320" end="00:25:49.250">at this point I think I think I have the data displayed onto the map control</p>
      <p begin="00:25:49.250" end="00:25:56.890">...guys want to see that again ok?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:56.890" end="00:26:00.220">So, this is the same universal platform use</p>
      <p begin="00:26:00.220" end="00:26:04.300">...platforms so it'll run nicely on the phone.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:04.300" end="00:26:08.520">And, the clustering libraries for you it's up it's actually a little right now and get help uploaded</p>
      <p begin="00:26:08.520" end="00:26:13.530">...top accountyou can go ahead and downloaded.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:13.530" end="00:26:17.380">So, this one is a little bit responsive I have this...view in</p>
      <p begin="00:26:17.380" end="00:26:22.960">...use my own design I guess and, we also have a nice to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:28.840">...box...so as you can see this works fine next what I want</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.840" end="00:26:33.780">is I want to build and itinerary so as I added those things in my selected...</p>
      <p begin="00:26:33.780" end="00:26:39.070">collection I want to display that display of route along the map so what I'll do</p>
      <p begin="00:26:39.070" end="00:26:43.920">is I will iterate through that through all those points that I have in my</p>
      <p begin="00:26:43.920" end="00:26:51.590">selected...and, I will put into the map routes finder service.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:51.590" end="00:26:53.570">...the map...finder service I put in the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:53.570" end="00:26:59.110">points I put in the parameters to optimize on time or distance</p>
      <p begin="00:26:59.110" end="00:27:01.610">...the optimization on time...</p>
      <p begin="00:27:02.810" end="00:27:07.130">So, I'll show I'll allow them to optimize on time and distance then</p>
      <p begin="00:27:07.130" end="00:27:12.590">I will also allow them to put restrictions which was avoid</p>
      <p begin="00:27:12.590" end="00:27:16.360">...highways so on so after this I get a</p>
      <p begin="00:27:16.360" end="00:27:20.870">map router result and the map out result I could easily</p>
      <p begin="00:27:20.870" end="00:27:24.630">...out on the map using the map out view</p>
      <p begin="00:27:24.630" end="00:27:29.500">...in this case I'm going to go through iterate through all those points and I will</p>
      <p begin="00:27:29.500" end="00:27:34.330">display the party-line on map control so I will create a party-line apply</p>
      <p begin="00:27:34.330" end="00:27:39.080">line the line that you can display on the map you provided a geo part and</p>
      <p begin="00:27:39.080" end="00:27:43.670">...display the geo part is part of the results that I'd get out of the map out</p>
      <p begin="00:27:43.670" end="00:27:47.710">finder and I can added to the map elements collection...displays</p>
      <p begin="00:27:47.710" end="00:27:52.640">...polygon then along the...on all the points where the movies are</p>
      <p begin="00:27:52.640" end="00:27:56.520">short...display the camera and this is going to</p>
      <p begin="00:27:56.520" end="00:28:01.490">...display the map element correctly on the map that out clicking on the map</p>
      <p begin="00:28:01.490" end="00:28:05.820">...this mike.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:05.820" end="00:28:10.980">Now after displayed...I'm also resetting the view so that the entire</p>
      <p begin="00:28:10.980" end="00:28:19.060">routers visible as...viewpoints and add them to the...</p>
      <p begin="00:28:19.060" end="00:28:23.890">These are the points where the users really want to go as you can see the have information about the movie in</p>
      <p begin="00:28:23.890" end="00:28:29.340">the text format and now let's look at the show might out.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:29.340" end="00:28:32.410">And, it displays allowed on the map control and,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:32.410" end="00:28:37.410">you can customize this you can customize the map poly lines the color you can customize the</p>
      <p begin="00:28:37.410" end="00:28:43.210">map...thickness so on next what I want to do is.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:43.210" end="00:28:45.720">So, okay, let's revisit what we what we did a</p>
      <p begin="00:28:45.720" end="00:28:49.790">...created some map icon speex added on the map control we</p>
      <p begin="00:28:49.790" end="00:28:54.290">...we added on the map added to the map elements we did some real</p>
      <p begin="00:28:54.290" end="00:28:58.660">...coding we did clustering and finally we did</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58.660" end="00:29:01.860">the map out finder service next what I one is I want</p>
      <p begin="00:29:01.860" end="00:29:06.840">to access uses location and I won the users to come and meet me</p>
      <p begin="00:29:06.840" end="00:29:10.900">...a common point so we can take them on the tour and because it's</p>
      <p begin="00:29:10.900" end="00:29:15.590">a small company I want them to come meet...at a small a good place where I</p>
      <p begin="00:29:15.590" end="00:29:19.420">where my offices so I use the geo located or</p>
      <p begin="00:29:19.420" end="00:29:24.830">of service I request access is think I get the permission once I had</p>
      <p begin="00:29:24.830" end="00:29:28.480">the permission I request the user for the location.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:29.650" end="00:29:31.750">Once I have the location I build a</p>
      <p begin="00:29:31.750" end="00:29:36.620">uri and this is the same you what I service that I was talking about earlier</p>
      <p begin="00:29:36.620" end="00:29:42.800">where you can now launch into the bing maps app built-in windows maps...</p>
      <p begin="00:29:42.800" end="00:29:50.010">And, that will help the that would get the user to where they want.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:50.010" end="00:29:51.630">If the user is, you know, it</p>
      <p begin="00:29:51.630" end="00:29:56.980">is denying are the location access for us then I'm going to display a nice</p>
      <p begin="00:29:56.980" end="00:30:01.100">contin dialogue with a nice message saying hey you seems you did not give</p>
      <p begin="00:30:01.100" end="00:30:05.990">me location access...can go...but if you</p>
      <p begin="00:30:05.990" end="00:30:10.180">want, you know,...you want to ask them to change their mind you can awesome to go to</p>
      <p begin="00:30:10.180" end="00:30:17.940">the privacy settings and change their mind let's run this and see how that how that goes.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:17.940" end="00:30:24.280">Show might get redirects...this is the system prompt that shows up the first-time you do request access</p>
      <p begin="00:30:24.280" end="00:30:28.110">...and I'm going to allow this time.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:28.110" end="00:30:31.930">And, it is going to launch the built-in windows maps app that...shoreline the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:31.930" end="00:30:41.780">keynote today this is build under the same maps platform is available to you.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:46.520" end="00:30:51.460">So, this is the maps app and this is how you the user can get the direction you can just call the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:51.460" end="00:30:56.760">...scheme...directions to it this is...same platform it is very rich</p>
      <p begin="00:30:56.760" end="00:31:00.420">and features as you can see...can search for things you can marketing</p>
      <p begin="00:31:00.420" end="00:31:07.420">...favorite...locations...favorite are you can also explore three-d.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:07.420" end="00:31:09.940">And, that's because of the cities and look at three-d view</p>
      <p begin="00:31:09.940" end="00:31:20.760">of the cities and this is a very rich display of the three-d view.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:20.760" end="00:31:24.090">And, when I saw this the first-time I realize hey, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:24.090" end="00:31:27.960">what I want this in my app and I know mike has worked on it and he's going to help</p>
      <p begin="00:31:27.960" end="00:31:35.910">me out with getting things on the getting three-d view in my map...</p>
      <p begin="00:31:35.910" end="00:31:40.340">So, as ron mentioned for the first-time we are offering aerial three-d and street-side</p>
      <p begin="00:31:40.340" end="00:31:46.040">exploration imagery as part of the windows map platform that you can take advantage of so,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:46.040" end="00:31:50.140">you know, we have this movie spot application and we've seen some really great things with it a</p>
      <p begin="00:31:50.140" end="00:31:53.910">lot of times when you want to do data analysis as a case in point you</p>
      <p begin="00:31:53.910" end="00:31:58.800">want a roadmap as...background because it'll show you all of the location and the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:58.800" end="00:32:02.410">sites and the,... the outline...where the water is but,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:02.410" end="00:32:07.260">it's also very neutral background for your data for showing polygons and poly lines</p>
      <p begin="00:32:07.260" end="00:32:11.710">and map icons but in some other scenarios are you want to take the user</p>
      <p begin="00:32:11.710" end="00:32:16.040">tool location you want them to field in see and...almost get a sense of deja</p>
      <p begin="00:32:16.040" end="00:32:20.710">...of what that location will be like so, for example, if you're building a house</p>
      <p begin="00:32:20.710" end="00:32:24.620">finding application people want to see what's around this potential house</p>
      <p begin="00:32:24.620" end="00:32:27.810">...I'm going to buy what...the neighborhood look like what stores</p>
      <p begin="00:32:27.810" end="00:32:31.630">are nearby so this exploration imagery can be a very key tool</p>
      <p begin="00:32:31.630" end="00:32:36.060">for you to make your application a lot more evocative and will add some to the movies by</p>
      <p begin="00:32:36.060" end="00:32:40.350">application just a second but first let's talk a little bit about this</p>
      <p begin="00:32:40.350" end="00:32:44.670">exploration imagery I mean two things when I say exploration imagery I'm talking about being</p>
      <p begin="00:32:44.670" end="00:32:50.670">aerial three-d and street-side imagery as well that go great together now for being</p>
      <p begin="00:32:50.670" end="00:32:55.630">aerial three-d I'm talking about three sub components of the first for</p>
      <p begin="00:32:55.630" end="00:33:00.220">aerial three-d mode we feature a globe based projection of the world so rather than</p>
      <p begin="00:33:00.220" end="00:33:05.130">having a flat mankato projection which has a lot of conveniences associated with it but has</p>
      <p begin="00:33:05.130" end="00:33:10.860">a downside that extreme latitudes will tend to get a little bit more distorted the globe</p>
      <p begin="00:33:10.860" end="00:33:15.090">...actually show all the area in sort of a more realistic realistically size</p>
      <p begin="00:33:15.090" end="00:33:20.200">...type of format for you it's based on a wg sat for ellipsoid so</p>
      <p begin="00:33:20.200" end="00:33:25.130">it's consistent with your...gps in the gps information you might be getting so</p>
      <p begin="00:33:25.130" end="00:33:29.030">it's a very highly accurate...representation of the world?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:29.030" end="00:33:33.150">Now on top of...production we have digital elevation data that</p>
      <p begin="00:33:33.150" end="00:33:37.980">we've collected from a lot of different sources around the world and then we overlay a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:33:37.980" end="00:33:42.100">aerial and satellite imagery that we collect ourselves and that we get from a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:33:42.100" end="00:33:47.700">partners so the result of this is that we have this world the entire world that has</p>
      <p begin="00:33:47.700" end="00:33:52.030">a very high-resolution imagery and you can get very realistic scenes so in</p>
      <p begin="00:33:52.030" end="00:33:56.190">this case you can see behind me there's mounting helen's which erupted in nineteen eighty</p>
      <p begin="00:33:56.190" end="00:34:01.300">and washington and, you know, it was...a very huge mountain...a very</p>
      <p begin="00:34:01.300" end="00:34:05.560">...bigger option and, you can still see from the satellite imagery the reveal</p>
      <p begin="00:34:05.560" end="00:34:10.400">...of where the lava flowed in the dome and...almost</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.400" end="00:34:15.780">...of this mountain that they explode that's available for-you to ...inside of</p>
      <p begin="00:34:15.780" end="00:34:20.550">your application so if nothing else to your favorite mountain range and take a look at in</p>
      <p begin="00:34:20.550" end="00:34:26.170">the three-d view of the windows and application it should be pretty stunning but the final thing that we</p>
      <p begin="00:34:26.170" end="00:34:29.890">have on top of aerial thirty is three-d cities.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:29.890" end="00:34:33.830">So, you may not know this but microsoft actually has and end-to-end</p>
      <p begin="00:34:33.830" end="00:34:38.950">pipeline for collecting three-d data on cities it starts with the camera</p>
      <p begin="00:34:38.950" end="00:34:43.470">microsoft actually manufactures this camera that's called the ultracam is about the size of</p>
      <p begin="00:34:43.470" end="00:34:47.990">a compact refrigerator it has a number of different lenses in a number of different sensors</p>
      <p begin="00:34:47.990" end="00:34:51.780">in it and we actually fly all over the world and collect information</p>
      <p begin="00:34:51.780" end="00:34:55.460">...so good that we actually sold to other companies as well that use it for</p>
      <p begin="00:34:55.460" end="00:34:57.390">aerial surveying so you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:57.390" end="00:35:02.560">if you're in the business of aerial surveying you should definitely consider and...as well but,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:02.560" end="00:35:06.800">we actually take the camera and we put them on planes and when the weather's good...probably it, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:06.800" end="00:35:09.770">summer season will fly-over various cities and</p>
      <p begin="00:35:09.770" end="00:35:14.010">...areas in that city from a lot of different angles and that allows</p>
      <p begin="00:35:14.010" end="00:35:19.150">us to reconstructed and put it back together into a full three-d city so</p>
      <p begin="00:35:19.150" end="00:35:24.330">we've been flying a lot recently and we have over... two hundred</p>
      <p begin="00:35:24.330" end="00:35:29.360">cities in over seventy five thousand square kilometers of three-d space</p>
      <p begin="00:35:29.360" end="00:35:34.770">...flying in north america and europe in australia and asia we've collected a lot of the classic</p>
      <p begin="00:35:34.770" end="00:35:39.350">size of the world so the palaces of madrid or the coliseum in rome or the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:39.350" end="00:35:44.310">...florence we have gold coast in australia so beautiful beaches you can go take</p>
      <p begin="00:35:44.310" end="00:35:49.660">a look at...also collect a lot of cities in north america to so we have chicago in</p>
      <p begin="00:35:49.660" end="00:35:55.290">...york and of course san francisco so check that out...as well but it's not also just</p>
      <p begin="00:35:55.290" end="00:35:59.080">the big cities...collect a lot of smaller and more medium-sized cities so,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:59.080" end="00:36:04.500">for example, sacremento...madison wisconsin or tucson arizona we're</p>
      <p begin="00:36:04.500" end="00:36:06.950">continually gathering more data and making</p>
      <p begin="00:36:06.950" end="00:36:11.840">this available inside of the map application on a month-by-month basis?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:11.840" end="00:36:15.250">So, a lot of you might be familiar with open world video games where, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:15.250" end="00:36:17.920">the open world has maybe twenty or thirty or forty or</p>
      <p begin="00:36:17.920" end="00:36:22.620">fifty square kilometers that you can go walk around then we have seventy five thousand square kilometers</p>
      <p begin="00:36:22.620" end="00:36:27.330">that available to you the developer to feature your application it's almost as big as the size of south</p>
      <p begin="00:36:27.330" end="00:36:32.150">carolina or...every single tree and every single structure and every single</p>
      <p begin="00:36:32.150" end="00:36:35.260">air conditioning unit on top of that...in full</p>
      <p begin="00:36:35.260" end="00:36:42.690">detail with textured with textures on top of it so it's really quite incredible.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:42.690" end="00:36:44.510">So, let's just take a quick look let's go back to that</p>
      <p begin="00:36:44.510" end="00:36:48.590">movie spot application soI love the idea of a movie</p>
      <p begin="00:36:48.590" end="00:36:54.120">...application ... san-francisco has been a very big character and movies I particularly like</p>
      <p begin="00:36:54.120" end="00:36:58.910">the movie bullet so bullet if you're not familiar with it is a nineteen sixty eight car chase</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.910" end="00:37:03.640">movie starring...queen and it has one of the most iconic car chase</p>
      <p begin="00:37:03.640" end="00:37:08.610">scenes in it and the reason is because it was filmed kind of in downtown san francisco on all around</p>
      <p begin="00:37:08.610" end="00:37:12.030">san francisco so you'll see lots of cars careening around corners</p>
      <p begin="00:37:12.030" end="00:37:17.170">and going over the very steep hills that you see in san francisco so, there's one place, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:17.170" end="00:37:22.390">...in north beach that was one spot where I think is one of some of the famous</p>
      <p begin="00:37:22.390" end="00:37:26.200">...scenes where they're going over hills so, yeah, I guess we can see</p>
      <p begin="00:37:26.200" end="00:37:31.570">with the application that looks pretty good but, you know, what would be even more you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:31.570" end="00:37:35.280">evocative if maybe we can see that and aerial three-d let's?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:38.630">Go port the application over to ariel three-d and,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:38.630" end="00:37:42.140">to do this were essentially just going to add one line of additional zone</p>
      <p begin="00:37:42.140" end="00:37:47.540">...application so in the windows ten map platform we've added a couple of new map</p>
      <p begin="00:37:47.540" end="00:37:49.870">styles aerial three-d.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:49.870" end="00:37:52.560">And,...three-d with roads aerial three-d</p>
      <p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:57.750">will show you the completely natural world devoid of any lines are labels you can see it as if you're</p>
      <p begin="00:37:57.750" end="00:38:00.410">...astronaut from outer space but,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:00.410" end="00:38:04.200">you can also add...three-d with roads and labels and we have a</p>
      <p begin="00:38:04.200" end="00:38:07.770">...extensive labeling algorithm world put on all the various labels for</p>
      <p begin="00:38:07.770" end="00:38:12.590">rosen countries as appropriate ...get included by train and it's really quite</p>
      <p begin="00:38:12.590" end="00:38:17.350">detailed so let's go use...with robles code check this out.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:17.350" end="00:38:21.670">...the application boots...still see san-francisco we're going to be starting with a nader</p>
      <p begin="00:38:21.670" end="00:38:26.480">view top-down on but let's go drill into that location...north...</p>
      <p begin="00:38:26.480" end="00:38:28.770">First will search for the movie bullets we can see just the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:28.770" end="00:38:33.370">bullet sites let's go drill into a goes by and corporate park,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:33.370" end="00:38:37.900">yeah, there you go I think that's the icon create great.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:37.900" end="00:38:41.810">Okay, so, now yes and this I think this is that so you can see that this is a</p>
      <p begin="00:38:41.810" end="00:38:46.630">released detail it's almost like a really gigantic speed bump and you can just imagine cars,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:46.630" end="00:38:51.340">... in a car chase going over this hill and, you know, it almost reminds me of the scene from the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:51.340" end="00:38:56.740">movie so fairly powerful and...sort of manipulated with his fingers and get different</p>
      <p begin="00:38:56.740" end="00:39:01.820">perspectives so you know, aerial three-d really cool for making</p>
      <p begin="00:39:01.820" end="00:39:06.560">and really useful for making various locations very evocative and memorable.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:06.950">So, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:06.950" end="00:39:11.810">that's a little bit of a quick view of...adding three-d as you saw was essentially just adding enumeration</p>
      <p begin="00:39:11.810" end="00:39:14.780">...your mapping if we had more time we probably had a couple button so you</p>
      <p begin="00:39:14.780" end="00:39:17.000">can switch between the two.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:17.000" end="00:39:19.060">Okay, well,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:19.060" end="00:39:23.310">the three...very useful but there is an additional complexity you now have to think a little bit more</p>
      <p begin="00:39:23.310" end="00:39:24.240">...three-dimensions.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:25.610" end="00:39:29.350">So, if you've ever develop a map application before you're probably</p>
      <p begin="00:39:29.350" end="00:39:39.720">very familiar with you know-how it works it's a kind of a tile base you very top-down.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:39.720" end="00:39:45.340">go cool all right very top-down it's very straightforward it's based on tiles so,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:45.340" end="00:39:49.470">there's a lot of simple assumptions that you can make when you build your application so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:49.470" end="00:39:54.420">you're always looking at a rectangle and the top left is this lat long in the bottom right is this lat long</p>
      <p begin="00:39:54.420" end="00:39:59.400">the...slap in the middle so you just divide by two and it's fairly straightforward you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:59.400" end="00:40:05.810">there's always a center the center is really the center of gravity so it's pretty straightforward.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:05.810" end="00:40:10.810">When you have to think about three-d things get a little bit more tricky the users looking at a globe in</p>
      <p begin="00:40:10.810" end="00:40:14.390">...probably pivoting down there map...camera to get a good look at</p>
      <p begin="00:40:14.390" end="00:40:18.440">that three-d imagery but when they do that they could be looking off the horizon</p>
      <p begin="00:40:18.440" end="00:40:23.720">so a particular spot that's on the users screen may not actually correspond to a spot</p>
      <p begin="00:40:23.720" end="00:40:27.780">on the map in addition the center of the map is not simply just</p>
      <p begin="00:40:27.780" end="00:40:32.050">...divide by two of the center of the screen again because they're looking at the horizon the</p>
      <p begin="00:40:32.050" end="00:40:37.010">center might be actually much lower and more difficult to compute and the users also not looking</p>
      <p begin="00:40:37.010" end="00:40:41.090">at a strict rectangle they could be looking...oblique perspective that's almost like</p>
      <p begin="00:40:41.090" end="00:40:44.250">...rounded trapezoid in a sense?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:44.250" end="00:40:47.270">So, there's a little bit more complexity there.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:47.270" end="00:40:51.280">In addition you have to think about elevation altitude so the windows</p>
      <p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:56.640">...that platform supports different types of altitude systems that-you might want-to decide to</p>
      <p begin="00:40:56.640" end="00:40:58.700">use ellipsoid is based on sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:40:58.700" end="00:41:03.610">...model of the world that's basically...ellipsoid type of...sphere there's</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03.610" end="00:41:07.620">...which is based on the gravitational model of the world which is a little bit more accurate</p>
      <p begin="00:41:07.620" end="00:41:12.380">and frequently used by gps systems to indicate your altitude but then we also have terrain</p>
      <p begin="00:41:12.380" end="00:41:17.280">...surface so you're going to want to think about what this icon to show up on the train but maybe</p>
      <p begin="00:41:17.280" end="00:41:20.970">under a building or do I wanted to show on top of a building which, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:20.970" end="00:41:26.820">has its own pros and cons...some complexity there but the good news is that we've tried to</p>
      <p begin="00:41:26.820" end="00:41:31.370">make it as easy as possible work with three-d in particular when you're trying to set of</p>
      <p begin="00:41:31.370" end="00:41:36.300">wvu we've added a couple of concepts to hopefully make that easier for you first we've added</p>
      <p begin="00:41:36.300" end="00:41:40.700">the concept of a camera which will give you the perspective that you're looking from so</p>
      <p begin="00:41:40.700" end="00:41:43.960">if you think about a first-person video game this is the sort of</p>
      <p begin="00:41:43.960" end="00:41:49.500">the perspective that you're looking out from and then we have this concept of the scene now seen as a way</p>
      <p begin="00:41:49.500" end="00:41:53.940">for you the developer to provide a description of the thing you want to look at and then</p>
      <p begin="00:41:53.940" end="00:41:58.780">handed over to the windows ten map control and it will try to find the best possible map</p>
      <p begin="00:41:58.780" end="00:42:03.540">view and keep in mind it has to do a little bit more thinking about that it will do the work to</p>
      <p begin="00:42:03.540" end="00:42:08.450">make sure that your view doesn't get obstructed by a mountain or building war, you know, if you</p>
      <p begin="00:42:08.450" end="00:42:13.390">want to look at something in denver and denver's, you know, five or six thousand feet up that will put</p>
      <p begin="00:42:13.390" end="00:42:19.180">...the right position to see that in addition it's very important to have very</p>
      <p begin="00:42:19.180" end="00:42:23.930">smooth animations and transitions as users go from point-to-point and these sets</p>
      <p begin="00:42:23.930" end="00:42:27.030">seen api is a map dot prices</p>
      <p begin="00:42:27.030" end="00:42:31.800">...will also come up with the right a animation to easily and naturally</p>
      <p begin="00:42:31.800" end="00:42:36.480">transducer transition the user from one point to the next so this is the call map</p>
      <p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:39.690">...seen a saying it's very similar to the tricycle</p>
      <p begin="00:42:39.690" end="00:42:45.930">...saying and what it takes...a map...object and we have a lot of constructors for building that?</p>
      <p begin="00:42:45.930" end="00:42:50.910">So, let's just take a quick look at making the map a little bit more evocative by using these new api</p>
      <p begin="00:42:50.910" end="00:42:55.380">is so as rohan added earlier we have a clustering api so that</p>
      <p begin="00:42:55.380" end="00:42:59.130">we show where there's a lot of potential movie locations and</p>
      <p begin="00:42:59.130" end="00:43:03.390">...three-d mode what I want to do now is when somebody clicks on a cluster I</p>
      <p begin="00:43:03.390" end="00:43:09.160">...make sure that ...make sure that we show a really great three-d perspective that users know that they can sort of,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:09.160" end="00:43:13.090">you know, drag-and-drop and move around so we've commented out...tricycle...a</p>
      <p begin="00:43:13.090" end="00:43:16.990">...call and replaced it with tries that...</p>
      <p begin="00:43:16.990" end="00:43:21.660">Now in particular we have a method called map seen dot create from location radius...</p>
      <p begin="00:43:21.660" end="00:43:27.770">pass in the location that were using before ...addition it has a radius property of</p>
      <p begin="00:43:27.770" end="00:43:31.080">the radius is sort of a different alternative</p>
      <p begin="00:43:31.080" end="00:43:36.480">zoom level in some ways a better alternative zoom level what it says is here's show me</p>
      <p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:41.000">this center point but then show me this many meters around this center point so,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:41.000" end="00:43:43.460">for example, if you think about the standard city block being</p>
      <p begin="00:43:43.460" end="00:43:48.160">hundred-meters why'd passing a value of five hundred basically says show me about</p>
      <p begin="00:43:48.160" end="00:43:53.030">ten city blocks around this particular radius so it's a lot easier to reason about,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:53.030" end="00:43:57.790">you know, do you want to show ten city blocks, you know, five hundred-meters or you want to show the entire city,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:57.790" end="00:43:58.310">you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:58.310" end="00:44:03.200">san francisco I think is seven kilometers wide so something a little bit bigger might be more useful if you want to the</p>
      <p begin="00:44:03.200" end="00:44:08.440">...show someone the entire view of san francisco the other thing we want to pass in is a</p>
      <p begin="00:44:08.440" end="00:44:12.700">...to look at so forty five degrees means...but let's look at</p>
      <p begin="00:44:12.700" end="00:44:17.460">and easily directions let's change that...and the final parameters pitch</p>
      <p begin="00:44:17.460" end="00:44:22.080">...pitches how decline the camera will be fifty is somewhat the climate's go a little</p>
      <p begin="00:44:22.080" end="00:44:28.290">bit further and sixty-degree angle so that we get a really good perspective we'll try that out so,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:28.290" end="00:44:30.890">now...still start off with a top-down view of</p>
      <p begin="00:44:30.890" end="00:44:34.620">san-francisco to start with you can see the entire area but when you click</p>
      <p begin="00:44:34.620" end="00:44:40.030">on a cluster we'll get a beautiful view of it and see that it did in animation to take me</p>
      <p begin="00:44:40.030" end="00:44:44.980">to that location and now I can see downtown san francisco which is where all these movie scenes</p>
      <p begin="00:44:44.980" end="00:44:48.790">are you can see things like the trans america...made you can see,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:48.790" end="00:44:51.170">you know, the...center where or at you can see</p>
      <p begin="00:44:51.170" end="00:44:54.800">markets tree cutting through those you can see all the map icons</p>
      <p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:59.370">and map icons are appropriately included based on whether they're sort of behind buildings</p>
      <p begin="00:44:59.370" end="00:45:02.980">...fated if it's if it's close by so,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:02.980" end="00:45:07.520">setting a oblique perspective like this actually helps bring users into the map</p>
      <p begin="00:45:07.520" end="00:45:12.060">and makes it a little bit more evocative?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:12.060" end="00:45:15.180">All right so aerial three is the way to sort of see things from</p>
      <p begin="00:45:15.180" end="00:45:19.650">...to see things as if you had a magic helicopter and could file of the world</p>
      <p begin="00:45:19.650" end="00:45:24.100">street-side is the compliment to that this actually lets you see things from the human</p>
      <p begin="00:45:24.100" end="00:45:26.840">...ground-level...so street-side</p>
      <p begin="00:45:26.840" end="00:45:31.910">...a is a huge effort we have you know, we're building our own streetside imagery may have seen a</p>
      <p begin="00:45:31.910" end="00:45:37.130">being street-side...by your neighborhood perhaps we're expanding our</p>
      <p begin="00:45:37.130" end="00:45:41.600">...coverage for the bing street-side feature every for meters those cars drive</p>
      <p begin="00:45:41.600" end="00:45:46.730">they take fifty-five megapixels worth of imagery and, we collect all of that and great</p>
      <p begin="00:45:46.730" end="00:45:50.890">...is that we now make that available to the developer to use as a control in your map</p>
      <p begin="00:45:50.890" end="00:45:56.310">application so this is a great...to the aerial three-d can put the two together and really see</p>
      <p begin="00:45:56.310" end="00:45:59.520">some really nice imagery you can see here this is the top of the</p>
      <p begin="00:45:59.520" end="00:46:02.160">...streets at lombard street you can see our</p>
      <p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:06.900">...labeling algorithm is struggling to keep up with the angle of roads there of course you can</p>
      <p begin="00:46:06.900" end="00:46:12.660">see very beautiful perspective of san francisco and...tower in the background as well?</p>
      <p begin="00:46:12.660" end="00:46:17.710">So, using street-side is actually fairly simple it's essentially just two lines of code.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:17.710" end="00:46:21.830">Now we are expanding our coverage for street-side quite a bit but we don't cover</p>
      <p begin="00:46:21.830" end="00:46:26.770">everywhere yet so the first one of code that you're going to want to write is essentially a check in with a</p>
      <p begin="00:46:26.770" end="00:46:29.570">check will say is...latitude and longitude is there a</p>
      <p begin="00:46:29.570" end="00:46:33.640">streetside panorama near me a bubble if you will that I can look around</p>
      <p begin="00:46:33.640" end="00:46:39.060">...for that given location now here in san francisco because there's a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:46:39.060" end="00:46:42.930">of coverage there's always streetside panoramas nearby again...you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:42.930" end="00:46:47.110">driving every for meters were collecting essentially bubbles worth of data.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:47.110" end="00:46:50.140">Now if I successfully get back a streetside panorama then</p>
      <p begin="00:46:50.140" end="00:46:54.300">I can do is I can create what's called a street-side experience so the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:54.300" end="00:46:57.470">street-side is essentially a mode of the map control the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:57.470" end="00:47:02.630">user interface works a little bit differently you can only jump from bubble you can look around the bubble but,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:02.630" end="00:47:08.430">it doesn't work quite the same ways the map does so it's what we call a street-side experience so return on</p>
      <p begin="00:47:08.430" end="00:47:12.590">street-side experience I just set map dot custom experience to that new streetside</p>
      <p begin="00:47:12.590" end="00:47:17.410">experience with the panorama and then some additional parameters to say what my initial heading</p>
      <p begin="00:47:17.410" end="00:47:23.650">...pitch should be inside of the bubble so two lines of code and a way you go.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:23.650" end="00:47:27.280">So, let's go extend the movie spots application to incorporate</p>
      <p begin="00:47:27.280" end="00:47:30.920">this streetside experience so as I mentioned it's essentially just a</p>
      <p begin="00:47:30.920" end="00:47:33.930">...the map control so we're going to add a map control towards</p>
      <p begin="00:47:33.930" end="00:47:38.710">...which will hold the street-side experience so we've got another map control there this is</p>
      <p begin="00:47:38.710" end="00:47:43.980">...be inside of our movie info panel that we added earlier and now I just need a</p>
      <p begin="00:47:43.980" end="00:47:48.560">...the streetside panorama so when the info panel get shown we're going to consider whether to show</p>
      <p begin="00:47:48.560" end="00:47:50.510">street-side as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:50.510" end="00:47:53.550">As I mentioned the first couple lines of code will just say hey is</p>
      <p begin="00:47:53.550" end="00:47:57.770">there streetside panorama near this location here almost surely there will be but in</p>
      <p begin="00:47:57.770" end="00:48:02.910">the case there isn't one let's just go hide the street-side map control and get on with our lives but, when there is</p>
      <p begin="00:48:02.910" end="00:48:08.390">one we're going to instantiate that street-side experience now we have a couple of different variables that you can use</p>
      <p begin="00:48:08.390" end="00:48:11.490">to customize the streetside experience to turn off, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:11.490" end="00:48:15.320">some of the buttons zoom buttons so that you get a very pure view if you will of the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:15.320" end="00:48:21.760">streetside location then finally words...that custom experience on the map control?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:21.760" end="00:48:26.920">So, let's take a look at this let's go back to our bullet location so I think that is the spot movie</p>
      <p begin="00:48:26.920" end="00:48:35.190">where the car chases were but, let's take a look at, you know, the...I view if you will of that place.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:35.190" end="00:48:38.400">Go back to the north beach area organism in a little bit further</p>
      <p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:41.040">out there you go.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:41.040" end="00:48:45.140">Yet see the beautiful speed bump that's...essentially and now when</p>
      <p begin="00:48:45.140" end="00:48:48.970">we click on it you can see that the info panel came up and now we can actually see the</p>
      <p begin="00:48:48.970" end="00:48:53.410">streetside experience hosted inside that info panel so you can see...almost like a little bit of</p>
      <p begin="00:48:53.410" end="00:48:58.740">us ski jump in a...it's very steep and you can imagine how, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:58.740" end="00:49:03.570">a car chase would be kind of exciting going over that city over that particular scene so</p>
      <p begin="00:49:03.570" end="00:49:08.930">of course reliance able to manipulated and able to look around and go to different bubbles you know, again,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:08.930" end="00:49:13.680">there's, there's options in your user interface affords is that we can show as well if we wanted to but</p>
      <p begin="00:49:13.680" end="00:49:19.030">use wanted to show the...view here as well so...really interesting I want, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:19.030" end="00:49:22.050">encourage you to think about street-side not just as a compliment to</p>
      <p begin="00:49:22.050" end="00:49:25.790">...but think about it is its own standalone control so, for example,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:25.790" end="00:49:29.120">if you've got a customer relationship database and you have to show, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:29.120" end="00:49:33.430">thousands of potential customers...street-side control on your customer</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.430" end="00:49:38.330">form and that would give your sales people perspective of here's this customer here's</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38.330" end="00:49:44.090">...headquarters is here's what it looks like you can easily add a lot of very interesting detail and</p>
      <p begin="00:49:44.090" end="00:49:48.290">...any application that deals with location it uses the map</p>
      <p begin="00:49:48.290" end="00:49:53.000">controls its foundation but it doesn't have to necessarily go along with the map control so</p>
      <p begin="00:49:53.000" end="00:49:59.700">think about different scenarios where this might be useful for you...look forward to seeing what you can build with that.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:59.700" end="00:50:01.010">Okay, so,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:01.010" end="00:50:05.530">we've taken the movie spot application we've...as they can see all the movie spots and</p>
      <p begin="00:50:05.530" end="00:50:09.210">san-francisco we've added aerial three and street-side so you basically</p>
      <p begin="00:50:09.210" end="00:50:14.630">...away from this you know, all the tools I think you need to build...really great map application I think all</p>
      <p begin="00:50:14.630" end="00:50:19.010">the code we showed except the clustering stuff basically show you all the code the movies</p>
      <p begin="00:50:19.010" end="00:50:27.720">by application so you've got that your tool belt how about some tips and tricks?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:27.720" end="00:50:29.970">Hello, yeah, so, I think.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:29.970" end="00:50:34.290">Beaver able to see the map control we added map icons we added</p>

      <p begin="00:53:21.130" end="00:53:26.670">can display businesses on the canvas and you can hide them finally have a cup</p>
      <p begin="00:53:26.670" end="00:53:31.030">a few custom controls on top of the map control these are the ones which you would</p>

      <p begin="00:53:49.690" end="00:53:53.040">will explore the built-in default windows maps app</p>
      <p begin="00:53:53.040" end="00:53:56.410">this is built on top of the same maps platform that is</p>
      <p begin="00:53:56.410" end="00:54:01.590">available to you see what the maps app is capable of doing and...use if you have questions</p>
      <p begin="00:54:01.590" end="00:54:08.340">...insiders launch about how we using the maps platform in the maps app kick-start</p>
      <p begin="00:54:08.340" end="00:54:13.260">challenge after you've seen this...we've, you know, taken you through the basics of the map control</p>
      <p begin="00:54:13.260" end="00:54:17.470">quoting the quick such allen's on your points it should be very easy for you</p>
      <p begin="00:54:17.470" end="00:54:21.890">...those...familiarize yourself with the maps platform</p>
      <p begin="00:54:21.890" end="00:54:28.220">...a couple of sessions that I want you guys to make...order of there's one on friday ...by</p>
      <p begin="00:54:28.220" end="00:54:32.240">...burnett he's going to talk about the web control the bing</p>
      <p begin="00:54:32.240" end="00:54:38.050">maps web control and this is for your cross-platform applications on the web.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:38.050" end="00:54:42.890">Then we have ...of...can-we doesn't insiders launch and if you have any questions</p>
      <p begin="00:54:42.890" end="00:54:47.310">we are verify the ninety minutes and will be helping out view you should</p>
      <p begin="00:54:47.310" end="00:54:52.110">build beautiful apps using the maps platform and is available ready for you to do right now as you</p>
      <p begin="00:54:52.110" end="00:54:57.870">...app and all the source...available we have the resources up</p>
      <p begin="00:54:57.870" end="00:55:03.210">right now you can go check it out is already they don't get hub we also have a sample from last</p>
      <p begin="00:55:03.210" end="00:55:08.800">...built talk which was a windows phone eight-point one sample we...created that</p>
      <p begin="00:55:08.800" end="00:55:14.220">...was a very easy task...that windows stand and that's source code is available as is</p>
      <p begin="00:55:14.220" end="00:55:19.000">...lot of ui...but it's there as is and it's also available out there</p>
      <p begin="00:55:19.000" end="00:55:23.680">...good bunch of msdn sources and documents for-you the launch of what I</p>
      <p begin="00:55:23.680" end="00:55:39.180">samples there and that's a...any questions?</p>
      <p begin="00:55:39.180" end="00:55:42.940">So, is it possible to build...by then opt offline map</p>
      <p begin="00:55:42.940" end="00:55:48.780">...integration so turn by turn directions are not currently supported in the public</p>
      <p begin="00:55:48.780" end="00:55:53.520">dpi surface one-button as...like you mean a developing service from a to be yes that is</p>
      <p begin="00:55:55.240" end="00:55:59.810">...services map mapped out finder service should be available to you in the</p>
      <p begin="00:55:59.810" end="00:56:04.920">offline maps but to get the full turn by turn directions experience we don't have control for the</p>
      <p begin="00:56:04.920" end="00:56:09.860">full turn by turn experience for that you want to use of the uri activation that rancho</p>
      <p begin="00:56:09.860" end="00:56:21.970">did launch the windows and map app and that will do turn by turn directions offline as well?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:21.970" end="00:56:26.630">So, the question is there a javascript api for all of this as well so</p>
      <p begin="00:56:26.630" end="00:56:31.850">...we'll talk a lot about our javascript api is on friday we have the...the ajax</p>
      <p begin="00:56:31.850" end="00:56:36.470">...control that has a lot of these services, for example, routing and driving directions we don't</p>
      <p begin="00:56:36.470" end="00:56:41.400">have three and street-side yet we definitely know there's a lot of interest in that and,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:41.400" end="00:56:46.470">you know,...be good to hear your scenarios as well so, we don't have a yet but,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:46.470" end="00:57:06.880">we have the ajax have a control which is very flexible used...of solutions and...we'll talk about that on friday.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:06.880" end="00:57:13.590">So, the question is, you know, what's the costing and what's the charge for that so.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:13.590" end="00:57:18.670">We've as ron mentioned we actually have unifier token services that being map spoils you go to</p>
      <p begin="00:57:18.670" end="00:57:24.410">the...common get one when you get...basically a basic token and,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:24.410" end="00:57:30.960">that supports free usage for a comparatively high a number of...</p>
      <p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:36.190">Fifty thousand transactions a day for a windows application specifically so,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:36.190" end="00:57:41.130">it's two thousand transactions a day if you need to go more than that then we have a</p>
      <p begin="00:57:41.130" end="00:57:45.740">sales team that can sort of, you know, reach out and work and see if you need to go above.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:45.740" end="00:57:50.470">But, the first fifty thousand are per day or free and that really was...probably solve, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:50.470" end="00:58:07.380">the ninetieth percentile applications that we thinkor out there.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:07.380" end="00:58:09.750">So, the question is for data for</p>
      <p begin="00:58:09.750" end="00:58:14.060">cities what's our what's our road map and what's our plan so.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:15.300" end="00:58:20.120">Some of you may be familiar with...imagery that was a part of the windows</p>
      <p begin="00:58:20.120" end="00:58:23.710">...we had the three-d map preview application where this was initially featured</p>
      <p begin="00:58:23.710" end="00:58:28.120">in launch statically at something like forty cities in about a year-and-a-half we've gone to</p>
      <p begin="00:58:28.120" end="00:58:32.430">two hundred cities we've also been able to fly bigger cities because we've actually improved are</p>
      <p begin="00:58:32.430" end="00:58:36.770">camera hardware to make sure that we can get great views of urban canyons so,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:36.770" end="00:58:41.390">that's when the beauties of owning the pipeline so we've got from about forty two hundred I would</p>
      <p begin="00:58:41.390" end="00:58:44.900">...might expect something similar to that as we go over time,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:44.900" end="00:58:49.840">you know,...sometimes limited by, you know, we can't really...winter months and we have a lots of lags</p>
      <p begin="00:58:49.840" end="00:58:53.670">...rand-r collection but that's the kind of the rate that we've been growing and that's</p>
      <p begin="00:58:53.670" end="00:58:58.980">what we expect to grow for...three-d imagery for street-side as I mentioned</p>
      <p begin="00:59:00.090" end="00:59:09.580">were already rapidly sort of expanding how we cover that so that's grown quite a bit and covered as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:09.580" end="00:59:15.230">Can you actually get...offline now?</p>
      <p begin="00:59:15.230" end="00:59:17.210">So, there is a system-wide setting</p>
      <p begin="00:59:17.210" end="00:59:22.160">probably the user and the user selects the map that they want to select they want to download</p>
      <p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:28.160">...a system...white setting group to get data we can should you and, once the</p>
      <p begin="00:59:28.160" end="00:59:33.120">...is unloaded by the user it's not something that you can do as a developer all you can do is you can</p>
      <p begin="00:59:33.120" end="00:59:37.700">call-in...can do you can call into the offline map display screen in the system,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:37.700" end="00:59:45.540">system you why and, the user has to download the download the map themselves.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:45.540" end="00:59:50.330">So, when the user...the question is that a single transaction when the user when</p>
      <p begin="00:59:50.330" end="00:59:54.020">the user goes the system-wide...on the side...download a new map that's,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:54.020" end="00:59:57.460">you know, independent of your application and,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:57.460" end="01:00:02.880">when you use some of the map data we won't necessarily you know, charger transaction for that and if you</p>
      <p begin="01:00:02.880" end="01:00:09.590">use...around it you would but for using offline data that should not...transaction so,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:09.590" end="01:00:12.780">yeah, now that you're downloading california that's available on behalf of</p>
      <p begin="01:00:12.780" end="01:00:17.660">all applications plus the out-of-the-box map application because it is built on...platform so,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:17.660" end="01:00:19.840">yeah, so, it's available system-wide?</p>
      <p begin="01:00:21.930" end="01:00:23.980">Question moi.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:35.010" end="01:00:37.660">The question is...going to be more restriction</p>
      <p begin="01:00:37.660" end="01:00:41.910">...information about highways in terms of the height of the trucks so</p>
      <p begin="01:00:41.910" end="01:00:45.800">on that's good feedback we'll look into that.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:45.800" end="01:00:50.520">Yeah,we continually work with a lot of our map data providers to improve the state of</p>
      <p begin="01:00:50.520" end="01:00:54.370">our map data and that's definitely one of the areas that...would</p>
      <p begin="01:00:54.370" end="01:00:59.140">...get better fidelity on that will work with our various map providers to get...it is,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:59.140" end="01:01:04.000">you know, there's a lot of different providers in the world and lifetimes the data quality can be</p>
      <p begin="01:01:04.000" end="01:01:08.710">different in the product offerings are different so we always try to source as I like to say artisans</p>
      <p begin="01:01:08.710" end="01:01:15.310">...hands lacked all the data that we're going to...available to make I wanted...to</p>
      <p begin="01:01:15.310" end="01:01:21.220">...hills while I'm walking so I mean we are working through all...and...the user...site</p>
      <p begin="01:01:21.220" end="01:01:24.920">...we're like people to go and...on these are features.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:26.220" end="01:01:27.340">Question moi.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:34.700" end="01:01:38.820">So, the question is for the...offerings is altitude available</p>
      <p begin="01:01:38.820" end="01:01:43.810">...given lat long position it's not available directly through an api that's</p>
      <p begin="01:01:43.810" end="01:01:46.740">...the control we do have a being web service that does</p>
      <p begin="01:01:46.740" end="01:01:51.470">get you can use to get the altitude for location but, ...yeah,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:51.470" end="01:01:55.380">like I said it's not going strictly through our three-d imagery that's going through a web service to get the</p>
      <p begin="01:01:55.380" end="01:02:00.770">altitude forgiven location but if you do set...to be...yeah,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:00.770" end="01:02:05.660">we, yeah, so, for example, if you set the altitude, you know, hundred surface</p>
      <p begin="01:02:05.660" end="01:02:10.510">then, you know, whether you're on top of the golden gate bridge or whether you're sort of in the middle...desert will always put</p>
      <p begin="01:02:10.510" end="01:02:14.950">you hundred-meters above that particular location but getting the</p>
      <p begin="01:02:14.950" end="01:02:21.470">...underneath your a given lat...you have to have a web service for that.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:21.470" end="01:02:21.970">Question.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:33.980" end="01:02:38.770">Repeat the question so the question is can we use the map...fashions</p>
      <p begin="01:02:38.770" end="01:02:43.520">...data mining for...right now we have support for map items control for those animals</p>
      <p begin="01:02:43.520" end="01:02:48.910">...children and we're looking into bringing support for that...the map elements as well</p>
      <p begin="01:02:48.910" end="01:02:53.590">so, in the past we have done...support for the map control if...working towards</p>
      <p begin="01:02:53.590" end="01:02:58.590">a map elements of in the currents...is a bug for the map elements not working on</p>
      <p begin="01:02:58.590" end="01:03:09.370">...to that but sample to reach work correctly for the map items control.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:09.370" end="01:03:11.450">So, the question is there a way to import your own</p>
      <p begin="01:03:11.450" end="01:03:15.130">three-mile unfortunately there is in a way there is not a way to</p>
      <p begin="01:03:15.130" end="01:03:20.260">importer three-d model but it's a great feedback that we're taking should talk to</p>
      <p begin="01:03:20.260" end="01:03:25.640">get more about corrugated more about the scenarios so looks like we should probably</p>
      <p begin="01:03:25.640" end="01:03:29.240">...be in the ask the experts section over on the other side of</p>
      <p begin="01:03:29.240" end="01:03:34.050">the second-floor and will be happy to take your questions more the outsiders launch...tires</p>
      <p begin="01:03:34.050" end="01:03:38.520">...don't forget to evaluated helps us to brewer...thank you?</p>
