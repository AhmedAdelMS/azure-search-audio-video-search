      <p begin="00:00:10.680" end="00:00:15.830">sweet makes it easy to securely can make millions of devices to your</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.830" end="00:00:18.390">the application...and the</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:23.830">...dis can be done to receive telemetry and, the same commands not only that</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.830" end="00:00:29.480">...id swede is designed for multiply from devices n multiply from back</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.480" end="00:00:37.890">ends before we start going the deeper in the agenda let's start and,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.890" end="00:00:42.830">see what to talk is going to...about what we're going to start</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.830" end="00:00:47.130">by introducing device connectivity in the as...then</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.130" end="00:00:52.400">we're going to talk about device identity and provisioning and then we're going to go on to device</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.400" end="00:00:56.840">to cloud and cloud to device messages then we're going to talk about</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.840" end="00:01:02.200">...and monitoring this connectivity which is very important?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:02.200" end="00:01:08.120">So, let let's assume that you have lots of devices and they can be of</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.120" end="00:01:12.770">...kinds they can be ip capable so able to connect to the internet directly</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.770" end="00:01:18.370">...they can be low-power imbedded devices that can only connect to personal</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.370" end="00:01:23.830">...networks things like ...or core protocols.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.830" end="00:01:29.850">The ip capable devices can connect directly to measure coyote...to</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.850" end="00:01:35.220">these component...called ip hub that we're going...explore much more deeply in</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.220" end="00:01:40.250">this talk...throughcloud protocol gateway in kick in case that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.250" end="00:01:48.220">this did these devices due to not into interface with a protocol that is</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.220" end="00:01:52.660">in natively supported by...the...the are the other devices the</p>

      <p begin="00:02:07.070" end="00:02:14.450">...basically used to...communications between low-power and,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.450" end="00:02:19.630">non ip capable devices with the...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.630" end="00:02:24.160">On the on the back-end side the ip hub</p>
      <p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:29.610">allows a your event processing and inside components to receive telemetry</p>
      <p begin="00:02:29.610" end="00:02:35.080">...and,...messages from your from your devices components such as address</p>

      <p begin="00:02:56.410" end="00:03:01.460">request reply patents finally you you're going to have in your back and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.460" end="00:03:03.410">...device provisioning and,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.410" end="00:03:07.470">management component that will make sure that...did all your devices that and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:07.470" end="00:03:13.660">...you have in the field are kind ofare correctly configured and work as expected?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:13.660" end="00:03:17.460">And, in this talk...we're going to specifically focus on</p>
      <p begin="00:03:17.460" end="00:03:21.850">how the devices can connect to ip hub and how all the parts of your</p>
      <p begin="00:03:21.850" end="00:03:28.300">back-end can it can interacted out the hub to communicate with...devices?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:28.300" end="00:03:30.950">There of course many aspects to connectivity the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.950" end="00:03:38.790">first one is functionality the this can be very simple messages like device to</p>
      <p begin="00:03:38.790" end="00:03:43.370">cloud or cloud to devices and the but you can also inc include</p>
      <p begin="00:03:43.370" end="00:03:48.380">order form of communications like bulk uploads and downloads of files</p>
      <p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:55.060">there are also many kind of a securities that are...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:55.060" end="00:03:59.850">security concerns that are important...in addressing device</p>
      <p begin="00:03:59.850" end="00:04:04.990">connectivity and they can be the security of the device of the cloud of the channel</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.990" end="00:04:12.590">in this specific talk we're just going to talk about granting access rights</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.590" end="00:04:18.940">to devices to the imc the sweet and...not for the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.940" end="00:04:24.450">...security and end-to-end there is an order talk in build that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:24.450" end="00:04:32.550">the talks about ...security in end-to-end aspect please look,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:32.550" end="00:04:34.810">at that toc.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:34.810" end="00:04:39.420">Another aspect is very important is monitoring in...many io</p>
      <p begin="00:04:39.420" end="00:04:42.410">...solutions devices cannot be reach</p>
      <p begin="00:04:42.410" end="00:04:47.120">to be besides using network communications in</p>

      <p begin="00:05:02.180" end="00:05:08.800">component allows you to have to monitor the connectivity of the device and,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.800" end="00:05:09.120">receive</p>
      <p begin="00:05:09.120" end="00:05:15.580">feedbacks and events on what is happening in all those channels for all of your devices.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.580" end="00:05:19.540">Finally and also not less important than anything else</p>
      <p begin="00:05:19.540" end="00:05:22.290">our reach and customization casualty</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.290" end="00:05:30.720">...has as a goal to be able to connect to all possible to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:35.780">being like very small low-power and embedded devices running</p>

      <p begin="00:28:12.270" end="00:28:16.880">Let's look at...of how this was mph?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:16.880" end="00:28:24.180">Implemented in the demo first this is the turbine simulator let's start here</p>
      <p begin="00:28:24.180" end="00:28:28.450">with the with the...simulation method which gives like a high-level overview of what</p>
      <p begin="00:28:28.450" end="00:28:31.910">...what is happening here first we create a device</p>
      <p begin="00:28:31.910" end="00:28:37.290">klein class and this is a class that connects to</p>
      <p begin="00:28:37.290" end="00:28:41.710">...hub using the hub name the turbine id and the turbine</p>
      <p begin="00:28:41.710" end="00:28:46.740">key then there is a simulation loop this...there is a there's a central</p>
      <p begin="00:28:46.740" end="00:28:50.380">...in that sense every second there's of course are receive loop</p>
      <p begin="00:28:50.380" end="00:28:55.680">there is receiving for commands also I want to say while this code is</p>
      <p begin="00:28:55.680" end="00:28:59.850">in csharp mostly for clarity for during representation I will show</p>
      <p begin="00:28:59.850" end="00:29:08.740">later in the talk to snippets of on how to do these operations with our cst k.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:08.740" end="00:29:11.050">So, to simulation loop basically</p>
      <p begin="00:29:12.170" end="00:29:17.170">...of updates the state machine transition and, then actually</p>
      <p begin="00:29:17.170" end="00:29:20.380">...per performs the simulation step that updates</p>

      <p begin="00:29:23.840" end="00:29:29.340">torque and output...so on so forth let's look at on...on the central imagery</p>
      <p begin="00:29:29.340" end="00:29:35.410">thread this is a very simple loop that happens every second</p>
      <p begin="00:29:35.410" end="00:29:39.680">a new telemetry message is created here I</p>
      <p begin="00:29:39.680" end="00:29:44.010">...the message with the turban id with the time stampa...</p>
      <p begin="00:29:44.010" end="00:29:49.000">speed related speed so on so forth and then I quit a new messages by</p>

      <p begin="00:29:53.830" end="00:29:58.780">...array body so you can use any form of encoding that you</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.780" end="00:30:06.420">...won t that is there is important that fits best your solution.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:06.420" end="00:30:14.400">The then you just invoke to send event on your device client.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:14.400" end="00:30:15.230">On the</p>
      <p begin="00:30:15.230" end="00:30:19.630">under receiving and I have an event processor host.</p>

      <p begin="00:30:44.380" end="00:30:52.880">...storm or with...of course and then in my process events.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:59.220">Ie process my events and I get my messages of course when I</p>

      <p begin="00:37:12.910" end="00:37:17.620">there is a time-out that gives you a chance to do other things when you do not want</p>

      <p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:44.190">on meter connection where you want your device to wake up every a certain amount of</p>

      <p begin="00:41:38.970" end="00:41:45.020">or custom authentication this is of course be besides some specific up application</p>

      <p begin="00:43:18.310" end="00:43:23.720">of patterns that I want to talk about regarding gateways the first one is transparent</p>

      <p begin="00:43:28.570" end="00:43:33.000">gateway where device identity's are flowing through the gateway so the ip</p>
      <p begin="00:43:33.000" end="00:43:36.740">have is aware that there are like multiple devices</p>
      <p begin="00:43:38.290" end="00:43:43.220">connect intruded gateway and, each one of those can effectively have</p>
      <p begin="00:43:43.220" end="00:43:46.820">their own specific identity in this case ip</p>
      <p begin="00:43:46.820" end="00:43:53.770">hub can individually authenticate those devices and,...</p>
      <p begin="00:43:53.770" end="00:43:59.050">of course...labeling coming messages and, the and handled the access control</p>
      <p begin="00:43:59.050" end="00:44:05.230">...those specific devices by also being able to enable and,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:05.230" end="00:44:10.230">...them in individually and opaque gateway on the other hand is a</p>
      <p begin="00:44:10.230" end="00:44:17.310">gateway where it's a gateway that effectively is masking it's the</p>

      <p begin="00:44:44.370" end="00:44:50.660">of course incoming messages cannot be labeled and another big the distinctions</p>
      <p begin="00:44:50.660" end="00:44:55.920">...is between...gateways and push gateways a push gateway is a</p>
