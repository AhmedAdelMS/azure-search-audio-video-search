      <p begin="00:01:36.730" end="00:01:42.250">hands who's never use the document database before a lot of people all right all</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.250" end="00:01:47.440">right so you do a quick recap of document devices what they're good for what</p>
      <p begin="00:01:47.440" end="00:01:51.620">are not-so-good for kind of vague difference between them and relational</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.620" end="00:01:57.680">databases who has used some other document database so like among</p>

      <p begin="00:02:01.070" end="00:02:05.040">...the big favorites that you want a</p>

      <p begin="00:02:11.160" end="00:02:17.030">Just to give an idea of what you guys have been doing we're going to do a</p>
      <p begin="00:02:17.030" end="00:02:21.080">quick intro recap to document db it's not going to be a the?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.580" end="00:02:27.580">We're not just been too much time on that we want to try get down to the building</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.580" end="00:02:33.650">apps...the tips and tricks for building apps because that's where you want to spend a lot of time and</p>
      <p begin="00:02:33.650" end="00:02:38.960">we'll take a quick look ...ahead we've got some feedback from people that say</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.960" end="00:02:42.110">we really want to know what you guys doing what's on your</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.110" end="00:02:45.900">road ahead and we're not really usually very good sharing that kind of info</p>
      <p begin="00:02:45.900" end="00:02:51.320">publicly because it commits us to stuff but, that's okay I'll say what's, what's,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:51.320" end="00:02:59.250">what's on...so, what is a document database document...is?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.250" end="00:03:03.890">The type device that is very good at dealing with</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.890" end="00:03:07.040">dyson data...documents that look like that</p>
      <p begin="00:03:07.040" end="00:03:11.330">...read...you don't really need to as long as you get the idea that it's I</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.330" end="00:03:15.320">...hierarchical kind of...documents it's got some nesting in</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.320" end="00:03:20.050">...it can horizon a that can have...documents and the idea is that...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:20.050" end="00:03:24.850">thing isself-contained entity that describes some.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:25.940" end="00:03:30.680">Some entity that you're working with...b customer with autos and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.680" end="00:03:34.470">...lines and products or a contact with addresses</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.470" end="00:03:37.780">an contact details or anything that's kind</p>
      <p begin="00:03:37.780" end="00:03:41.220">of like self-contained into a document and that's I think</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.220" end="00:03:45.300">...the name comes from and if I had a time machine I'd go back in time and try</p>
      <p begin="00:03:45.300" end="00:03:49.400">and influence whoever called a document...document advice I try and get them</p>
      <p begin="00:03:49.400" end="00:03:53.590">...something else because it kinda creates a little bit of confusion but,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.590" end="00:03:57.110">when you think about these document devices there really are</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.110" end="00:04:00.140">the self-contained documents...</p>
      <p begin="00:04:00.140" end="00:04:04.710">when you deal with a relational database like sequel server?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.710" end="00:04:08.310">...dealing with tables you dealing with records...records</p>
      <p begin="00:04:08.310" end="00:04:12.890">...to other records and to get the entity what you actually go to the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.890" end="00:04:17.250">dues you gotta go and join a bunch of a whole bunch of tables together and compose the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:17.250" end="00:04:22.150">entity on-the-fly document databases take a different approach they say hey instead of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:22.150" end="00:04:25.130">me doing those computation calculation</p>
      <p begin="00:04:25.130" end="00:04:29.600">...on-the-fly what you should do is model your documents as these kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:36.530">...complete entities and there's a very good reason why.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:36.530" end="00:04:40.710">There are some papers and studies that say document devices scale</p>
      <p begin="00:04:40.710" end="00:04:45.620">at the internet scale they perform a whole lot better than relational databases</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.620" end="00:04:49.360">...this is one of the very big reasons relational databases have to do a</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:54.280">lot of work on-the-fly when you start joining ffifteen tables together to compose</p>
      <p begin="00:04:54.280" end="00:04:57.490">...and every time you...and entity it has to go and kind</p>
      <p begin="00:04:57.490" end="00:05:01.940">of break that up and righted to fifteen different tables and maintain locks and all that kind of stuff...was doing</p>
      <p begin="00:05:01.940" end="00:05:06.820">that or the document database you working on that single document entity so we don't need to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.820" end="00:05:10.500">...and...anything else all we do is we persist just that one into...the whole</p>
      <p begin="00:05:10.500" end="00:05:15.290">...all right so there's a fundamental difference between those two so when you start working</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.290" end="00:05:18.480">with document devices think about that.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:18.480" end="00:05:23.020">So, there really are good to those kind of document they're not so well...to that kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23.020" end="00:05:28.510">...now that's also adjacent document and, I could put that into a document</p>
      <p begin="00:05:28.510" end="00:05:34.000">advice no problem at all okay ...work.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:34.720">And, I could go</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:39.710">...search or query full things by id all by text</p>
      <p begin="00:05:39.710" end="00:05:42.540">okay this kind of document...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:43.710" end="00:05:47.820">is probably better served out of something like edges search or elastic social</p>
      <p begin="00:05:47.820" end="00:05:52.310">...laurel one of the search engines why because most of the searching that you can do on</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52.310" end="00:05:58.390">...document is worth...blocker text...you're going to be wanting to do full-text</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58.390" end="00:06:02.830">that makes a or full-text searching fuzzy logic searching...matching sound</p>
      <p begin="00:06:02.830" end="00:06:07.410">...matching all of that kind of stuff and that's probably better...suited to a search engine rather</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.410" end="00:06:10.180">...database changes something like</p>
      <p begin="00:06:10.180" end="00:06:13.060">...probably better...in?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.060" end="00:06:17.780">As research than in document in a document advice will work</p>
      <p begin="00:06:17.780" end="00:06:21.940">show you can do it but...going to stop you but there are other options.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:22.990" end="00:06:24.530">And, lastly.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24.530" end="00:06:26.660">They're definitely not for those kind of data</p>
      <p begin="00:06:26.660" end="00:06:31.380">document okay and I've got a lot of people come to me and...this is also how do I stole my</p>
      <p begin="00:06:31.380" end="00:06:34.920">...documents in as a document database.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:34.920" end="00:06:38.730">Document...are not for those kind of document write...really</p>
      <p begin="00:06:38.730" end="00:06:44.300">...for jason documents not where documents all...now if you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:06:44.300" end="00:06:49.020">...or content management solution that took...documents and you want to</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.020" end="00:06:54.010">...in something like as a document db you probably code right because what you do is you would create a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.010" end="00:06:59.900">meta that metadata documents and, in that jason you would put all the searchable curable fields that you want</p>
      <p begin="00:06:59.900" end="00:07:03.900">to query on you put that in the jason and then using document</p>
      <p begin="00:07:03.900" end="00:07:08.500">...attachment property you would attach the word document the binary to the metadata...</p>
      <p begin="00:07:08.500" end="00:07:13.450">and process that in document db because what we then do is we take a binary we put it</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.450" end="00:07:18.840">into blob storage and, now we are knee-deep and index the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.840" end="00:07:24.300">small metadata file so what I'm trying index these things if you want to indexing and searching inside of your</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.300" end="00:07:27.280">...documents office documents sharepoint so much better option</p>
      <p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:34.920">for you it's designed to do that sort of thing?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:34.920" end="00:07:37.870">Seems my clicker has a very limited range.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:37.870" end="00:07:41.000">All right so one of the things that have</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.000" end="00:07:44.030">...document devices by far the most popular</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44.030" end="00:07:48.350">database at the moment if you look at stats on the</p>
      <p begin="00:07:48.350" end="00:07:54.660">...growing devices there is one whose name shall not be...the room?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.660" end="00:07:59.240">That is probably the third or fourth most popular database in terms of growing</p>
      <p begin="00:08:00.370" end="00:08:03.950">...couple years...a very good reason why developers...flocking to</p>
      <p begin="00:08:03.950" end="00:08:08.870">document devices and that's because they love document devices and document</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08.870" end="00:08:13.730">devices love developers mostly document advice if you</p>
      <p begin="00:08:13.730" end="00:08:16.520">...yesterday on the data who was in</p>
      <p begin="00:08:16.520" end="00:08:20.990">the session yesterday on the foundations nobody so you...have seen</p>
      <p begin="00:08:20.990" end="00:08:24.240">me there yesterday how developer friendly</p>
      <p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:29.790">document databases onstage on-the-fly...to make a change to an application</p>
      <p begin="00:08:29.790" end="00:08:34.320">and without going through a whole modeling exercise and that without going through a whole or</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.320" end="00:08:36.730">...mapping exercise all I did was open</p>
      <p begin="00:08:36.730" end="00:08:41.710">...visual studio make a change to a model class they...change the ui and I could</p>
      <p begin="00:08:41.710" end="00:08:46.500">been persist a new field in the database right and that's how easy it is</p>
      <p begin="00:08:46.500" end="00:08:51.280">you can and it's so good for those the way we build applications that.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:51.280" end="00:08:57.170">Remembers and just doing a quick scan of the audience but he remembers when we bolts</p>
      <p begin="00:08:57.170" end="00:08:57.670">systems.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:59.090" end="00:09:02.210">Where we would...take a six-month planning phase and we would sit</p>
      <p begin="00:09:02.210" end="00:09:07.000">down and we would do this whole complicated data modeling exercise and,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:07.000" end="00:09:08.430">then often that six-month kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.430" end="00:09:12.500">...we then going to planning and we'd figure out how to map that into a domain</p>
      <p begin="00:09:12.500" end="00:09:17.880">object and eventually about a year later we would actually start building an application right we don't</p>
      <p begin="00:09:17.880" end="00:09:22.870">build applications like that anymore we sit down we go right I got a great idea we open up</p>
      <p begin="00:09:22.870" end="00:09:27.800">and ide whatever that is we...coding and now we just want to source that and retrieved from</p>
      <p begin="00:09:27.800" end="00:09:32.770">...is that's how we work and we want to make a change we go back into the application we make</p>
      <p begin="00:09:32.770" end="00:09:37.460">...code change we don't have to go through that whole process of kind of, you know, taking</p>

      <p begin="00:09:46.730" end="00:09:52.920">fact that not all records have those property ... that you just go in and,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:52.920" end="00:09:58.400">you work with them what we really like about document databases as well as...notion of</p>

      <p begin="00:15:37.690" end="00:15:42.540">we worked on the other one that we wanted to nile was concept of multi</p>

      <p begin="00:16:21.530" end="00:16:26.410">devices and that causes problems right we've seen some horrendous looking code that developers of</p>
      <p begin="00:16:26.410" end="00:16:29.690">had to write in their applications to deal with the fact that</p>
      <p begin="00:16:29.690" end="00:16:34.190">...unique compensation undo rollback and all sorts of crazy</p>
      <p begin="00:16:34.190" end="00:16:39.170">things so we really wanted to mail the fact that we want you to be able to</p>

      <p begin="00:16:42.960" end="00:16:47.760">Do one operation that touches a number of different documents and if that operation</p>
      <p begin="00:16:47.760" end="00:16:52.720">succeeds commit all those documents if the operation files rollback out and leave</p>
      <p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:16:56.820">the databases ones and then we really wanted to kind of the</p>

      <p begin="00:24:05.850" end="00:24:10.730">says think of a collection like a table and think of a document like a</p>
      <p begin="00:24:11.850" end="00:24:15.080">We don't want people to think of collections like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:15.080" end="00:24:19.120">We want people to think of collections as I partition of data you can</p>
      <p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:27.130">stick any data into a collection not just tighter of the same type.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:27.130" end="00:24:27.430">And, there's</p>
      <p begin="00:24:27.430" end="00:24:33.060">a number reasons for that because of features like being able to do multi</p>

      <p begin="00:24:39.230" end="00:24:43.300">make more sense of why we see collections as...</p>
      <p begin="00:24:43.300" end="00:24:49.340">of heterogeneous documents rather than the documents of the same type.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:49.340" end="00:24:53.210">So, when you start our planning for your application?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:53.210" end="00:24:57.930">Don't fink arbitration as a table...try and put customers into one products</p>
      <p begin="00:24:57.930" end="00:25:02.420">into one orders into one order details into one because eventually you'll end up with a</p>
      <p begin="00:25:02.420" end="00:25:07.180">database that has sixty collections for like a hundred major data and you'll be</p>
      <p begin="00:25:07.180" end="00:25:10.420">sighing document...really, really expensive</p>
      <p begin="00:25:10.420" end="00:25:17.540">...you took although lead either...you put into one collection it'll cost you twenty five bucks a month?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:17.540" end="00:25:23.530">So, if we move on let's take a look at the basics of document db okay and</p>
      <p begin="00:25:23.530" end="00:25:29.100">...the understanding of kind of how a resource models put together these...the database</p>
      <p begin="00:25:29.100" end="00:25:33.600">...the poorly credit database account and all that gives use...unique dna serviceable</p>
      <p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:37.120">...like most edges services we fully</p>
      <p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:41.850">...comply we fully race-based...everything in document db is a</p>
      <p begin="00:25:41.850" end="00:25:47.250">raced resource...can talk to at using a raced url everything</p>
      <p begin="00:25:47.250" end="00:25:52.330">from a database to a collection to a user to a permission object to</p>
      <p begin="00:25:52.330" end="00:25:56.150">...itself everything is...object and I can do</p>
      <p begin="00:25:56.150" end="00:26:03.270">...so put so pushes or posts to any resource in the database.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:03.270" end="00:26:08.540">So, that brings...database so databases a psychological thing there isn't</p>
      <p begin="00:26:08.540" end="00:26:13.140">a physical by devices a logical container logical way to group</p>
      <p begin="00:26:13.140" end="00:26:18.900">...collections and...together.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:18.900" end="00:26:22.100">Then we get into collections circulation is really like I said</p>
      <p begin="00:26:22.100" end="00:26:25.690">this container full for different kinds of the documents</p>
      <p begin="00:26:25.690" end="00:26:29.970">it's a physical allocation of resources so when you create a collection we actually go to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:29.970" end="00:26:35.990">a node somewhere in our cluster and we physically allocate you and</p>
      <p begin="00:26:35.990" end="00:26:41.130">At amount of cpu and amount of memory and amount of the sky and amount of network and,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:41.130" end="00:26:45.200">that's how we can might make sure that we don't have a noisy neighbor problem because</p>
      <p begin="00:26:45.200" end="00:26:49.550">that collection has very specific and very hard boundaries</p>
      <p begin="00:26:49.550" end="00:26:55.210">...a cannot operate outside of the boundary some no matter what anyone else is doing in their collection on</p>
      <p begin="00:26:55.210" end="00:26:59.230">their node you're getting that slice of that machine and we make sure that you get</p>
      <p begin="00:26:59.230" end="00:27:00.460">...so that machine.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:03.970" end="00:27:07.820">It's a scope...queries so today you can't do a query across collections</p>
      <p begin="00:27:07.820" end="00:27:12.570">...because a collection could be...any one of our</p>
      <p begin="00:27:12.570" end="00:27:17.210">clusters could be a thousand nodes so you can't do a query that spans across</p>
      <p begin="00:27:17.210" end="00:27:22.800">a thousand nodes what you need to do...talk about the slider is this notion of a fan</p>
      <p begin="00:27:22.800" end="00:27:27.590">out query so if you're looking for...and you don't really know what collection that's in all then you got</p>
      <p begin="00:27:27.590" end="00:27:35.100">...query every collection as a fine art query and consolidate results back together again.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:35.100" end="00:27:40.860">All right our storage...by sdts in...in the machine is solid-state</p>
      <p begin="00:27:40.860" end="00:27:43.880">disks and that's where your data...so we done back on the</p>
      <p begin="00:27:43.880" end="00:27:47.870">edges storage or anything like that there is these.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:47.870" end="00:27:52.480">In fact our index engine has been optimized for modern-day...these</p>
      <p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:59.000">so we...engine that takes advantage of a hardware that we running on.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:59.000" end="00:28:03.520">And, then they're below by the hour so if you create a collection try and you delete</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03.520" end="00:28:06.960">the collection immediately you'll get charge for an hour.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:06.960" end="00:28:10.550">Depending on what that is if it was and sone collection you'll get</p>
      <p begin="00:28:10.550" end="00:28:15.050">charge three-point-four...unknown is three-point-four...</p>
      <p begin="00:28:15.050" end="00:28:19.580">right so just keep that in mind as well when you especially important when you're running</p>
      <p begin="00:28:21.410" end="00:28:25.830">...you running a una taste that's...I...collection does some testing</p>
      <p begin="00:28:25.830" end="00:28:32.780">...collection that's going to charge you that's going to cost you three things to do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:32.780" end="00:28:36.230">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:36.230" end="00:28:40.840">And, then you get the notion of documents and a documents is mostly what you're going to work with</p>
      <p begin="00:28:40.840" end="00:28:47.240">that's your document it goes into a collection all right.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:47.240" end="00:28:52.070">Loan for schemer case you can put any kind of documentary like into...one</p>
      <p begin="00:28:52.070" end="00:28:56.950">into one collection and we are optimized for smaller documents rather than</p>
      <p begin="00:28:56.950" end="00:29:01.240">...documents and that's because smaller documents as you may have</p>
      <p begin="00:29:01.240" end="00:29:05.960">noticed if you've done anything on the internet or whatever smaller documents in terms of network io and this guy</p>
      <p begin="00:29:05.960" end="00:29:10.020">I work much better than one large document so decisive</p>
      <p begin="00:29:10.020" end="00:29:14.250">hundred small documents is actually lock lace network io and it's a lot quicker because</p>

      <p begin="00:30:04.300" end="00:30:09.650">...right it really is a lot of document lot-of a lot...could fit</p>
      <p begin="00:30:09.650" end="00:30:14.570">into a document plus five hundred twelve k is two little.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:14.570" end="00:30:19.450">And, we're listening we running some internal tests on different document sizes</p>

      <p begin="00:30:34.390" end="00:30:38.820">We're kind of tasting what things can...so,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:38.820" end="00:30:45.600">these are constantly under review and we may well left that limited in the future.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:46.760" end="00:30:48.530">And, then you get other things in document</p>

      <p begin="00:32:19.520" end="00:32:26.450">yourself propelling to the document...the attachment in the document if you want to do that way.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:26.450" end="00:32:27.200">Okay, so,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:27.200" end="00:32:31.810">document db jason documents this is what I look like they're actually when you look at a</p>
      <p begin="00:32:31.810" end="00:32:34.750">...adjacent documents actually tree.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:34.750" end="00:32:39.630">this is really important because what we base our index on because it's a tree that we can</p>
      <p begin="00:32:39.630" end="00:32:47.840">walken we can navigate through the tree were able to index every property in the document for you.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:51.770">So, talking about our indexing by default we index every property every</p>
      <p begin="00:32:51.770" end="00:32:53.500">attribute in the document.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:55.770" end="00:33:00.460">We think for the majority of the users.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:01.470" end="00:33:07.300">The default probably good but, we allow you to tweak that we...my changes to</p>
      <p begin="00:33:07.300" end="00:33:12.560">...if you find that you actually ...</p>
      <p begin="00:33:13.670" end="00:33:14.420">Data model really,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:14.420" end="00:33:19.160">really well and you have a big document with a thousand attributes and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:19.160" end="00:33:20.900">you any...query on a subset of</p>
      <p begin="00:33:20.900" end="00:33:25.400">them they or when there's a lot of fields in a document...being wasted in the</p>
      <p begin="00:33:25.400" end="00:33:29.910">index again that's going to cost you storage size it's going to cost you a</p>
      <p begin="00:33:29.910" end="00:33:34.490">...charges that kinda stuff so you can actually go into index policy and you can do things</p>
      <p begin="00:33:34.490" end="00:33:39.610">like include...paul's so by default we include everything but you can go slot excluding</p>
      <p begin="00:33:39.610" end="00:33:41.330">pods if you want?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:41.330" end="00:33:44.010">We also have two different indexing mods...consistent one is</p>
      <p begin="00:33:44.010" end="00:33:49.700">lazy so default is consistent serve as you writing the document were updating index</p>
      <p begin="00:33:49.700" end="00:33:56.440">...time and we find that the index keeps up and, the very highs</p>
      <p begin="00:33:56.440" end="00:34:01.210">...so we haven't found the index kind of lagging yet</p>
      <p begin="00:34:01.210" end="00:34:06.250">we watch all the time and we've got metrics to tell us whether it's lagging but</p>
      <p begin="00:34:06.250" end="00:34:10.890">...keeps up however if you've got these really big bulk insert kind</p>
      <p begin="00:34:10.890" end="00:34:12.230">of operations so I</p>
      <p begin="00:34:12.230" end="00:34:15.230">...every morning you in just a ton of data.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:16.700" end="00:34:20.260">And, it's not really that important that you can query on...immediately</p>
      <p begin="00:34:20.260" end="00:34:25.800">they what you could do is you could set the indexing policy or indexing mode on a collections lazy</p>
      <p begin="00:34:25.800" end="00:34:29.750">...that'll mean is that we just one index while you're writing and you can</p>
      <p begin="00:34:29.750" end="00:34:34.540">invest a ton of stuff and then the index...catch up in eventually</p>
      <p begin="00:34:34.540" end="00:34:38.930">consistent so you did hire right throughput</p>
      <p begin="00:34:38.930" end="00:34:45.000">worth with lazy mode and then we also have an indexing policy that says automatic</p>
      <p begin="00:34:45.000" end="00:34:50.290">manual right so you can actually switch automatic indexing of completely so when you put a</p>
      <p begin="00:34:50.290" end="00:34:54.970">...collection it doesn't get indexed unless you tell it to be index when you do the create</p>
      <p begin="00:34:54.970" end="00:34:59.900">statement so you can switch automatic indexing off and then only index some documents you</p>
      <p begin="00:34:59.900" end="00:35:03.470">put in the collection some documents you put in the collection you may not</p>
      <p begin="00:35:03.470" end="00:35:08.310">want to index the whole thing other documents...put in the collection you want to index so this way you can switch</p>
      <p begin="00:35:08.310" end="00:35:14.230">on all of depending on what you want to now even if the document has been</p>
      <p begin="00:35:14.230" end="00:35:17.710">...you can still redid as long as, you know, it's id you...</p>
      <p begin="00:35:17.710" end="00:35:26.870">readers all right so you can go in and you can actually read the document by its</p>
      <p begin="00:35:26.870" end="00:35:30.470">...paul's like I said you can kind of include...xthree...</p>
      <p begin="00:35:31.490" end="00:35:35.060">We also have currently two different index types will be adding more as we</p>
      <p begin="00:35:35.060" end="00:35:39.000">go we currently have to indexing types what is a hash and,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:39.000" end="00:35:42.480">that's really, really good for doing equality type operations</p>
      <p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:47.460">give-me all documents where age is twenty or give-me all</p>
      <p begin="00:35:47.460" end="00:35:49.320">...city is san-francisco.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:52.160" end="00:35:57.210">Hash indexes work really well for that kind of operation range index works well for give-me</p>
      <p begin="00:35:57.210" end="00:36:00.920">old documents where ages greater than thirty or where</p>
      <p begin="00:36:00.920" end="00:36:03.820">...between x and y ok so</p>
      <p begin="00:36:03.820" end="00:36:09.290">range operations range index all right now?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:09.290" end="00:36:14.060">Depending on what you're doing you can actually switch, switch index so,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:14.060" end="00:36:16.960">as you include...off you can see over there I'm including.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:24.010">...including...that...roots...giving it an index type of hash something apply</p>
      <p begin="00:36:24.010" end="00:36:28.520">hash index everything in my document the bottom one I think I'm saying</p>
      <p begin="00:36:28.520" end="00:36:33.280">...time stamp I wanted to be a range because I'm going to do range kind of operations on-chip time</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.280" end="00:36:39.300">...so that's what you can do over there and then as you start doing these things you can also change the index</p>
      <p begin="00:36:39.300" end="00:36:44.170">precision and index precision is largely a tradeoff between the amount of</p>
      <p begin="00:36:44.170" end="00:36:49.170">storage that we do and a and the speed of the index all of the index</p>
      <p begin="00:36:49.170" end="00:36:54.350">are more precise you are the quicker we will be okay but,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:54.350" end="00:36:58.720">the larger may be less precise ja the smaller you'll storage</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:04.800">requirements will be but the bigger the results...will have to kind of scan through...index.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:09.490">And, then you do that so javascript transactions all...these things on triggers</p>
      <p begin="00:37:09.490" end="00:37:13.700">in-store proxy allow you to do multiple document transactions so when you want</p>
      <p begin="00:37:13.700" end="00:37:18.880">to do that multiple document transaction slow procedure trigger.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:23.440">So, what you do...you going you define this whole procedure I'll show you what one looks like or trigger I'll show you</p>
      <p begin="00:37:23.440" end="00:37:28.100">one looks like and that can then go and perform operations</p>
      <p begin="00:37:28.100" end="00:37:33.140">gains multiple documents and either commit the whole thing as a snapshot as</p>
      <p begin="00:37:33.140" end="00:37:37.370">...transaction or effect still procedure</p>
      <p begin="00:37:37.370" end="00:37:42.180">ritalin javascript frozen era we roll back the whole thing and we...everything and put the database</p>
      <p begin="00:37:42.180" end="00:37:44.420">...consistent...</p>
      <p begin="00:37:44.420" end="00:37:46.720">In terms of query there are currently</p>
      <p begin="00:37:48.250" end="00:37:53.960">depending on currently there are two ways to query document db if</p>
      <p begin="00:37:53.960" end="00:37:57.590">...in dot net how many dot net developers and room.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:57.590" end="00:38:01.980">Actually sorry this is a...conference how many non dot net developers in the</p>
      <p begin="00:38:01.980" end="00:38:08.970">audience so node python javascript compliance right cool so.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:08.970" end="00:38:13.730">I'm going to talk quickly about the net stuff and then the other languages we haven't forgotten about so</p>
      <p begin="00:38:13.730" end="00:38:19.180">will be making changes into the other languages soon in dot net you can use</p>
      <p begin="00:38:19.180" end="00:38:24.720">...if you like writing stuff...language integrated query you can I should do that and,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:24.720" end="00:38:29.630">for the most part works there are some up right is that we don't yet support inside of link and that's because the back-end</p>
      <p begin="00:38:29.630" end="00:38:35.820">kind of query capabilities...catching up but,...works and then for the non dot</p>
      <p begin="00:38:35.820" end="00:38:39.040">that people even...the people that still prefer sequel</p>
      <p begin="00:38:39.040" end="00:38:44.430">syntax you can write your query as a sequels sql query.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:44.430" end="00:38:47.920">And, both work equally fine if you're doing race programming you</p>
      <p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:38:51.230">...sql as the body.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:51.230" end="00:38:56.820">And, you would execute query that way around.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:56.820" end="00:38:58.800">All right what we can also do is we can</p>
      <p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:02.450">...queries by introducing user-defined functions</p>
      <p begin="00:39:02.450" end="00:39:04.620">...one over here is a user-defined function call</p>
      <p begin="00:39:04.620" end="00:39:06.890">...it's written in javascript.</p>

      <p begin="00:39:16.260" end="00:39:20.050">And, you can do some really cool powerful things with you...if</p>

      <p begin="00:46:50.680" end="00:46:54.150">So, some things to kind of look at.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:54.150" end="00:46:56.780">When designing and ...the document</p>
      <p begin="00:46:56.780" end="00:47:01.630">db applications so yes there's still some design even though we're...agile kind</p>
      <p begin="00:47:01.630" end="00:47:07.690">of flexible goals cruel there's still some design that we have to kind of do upfront?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:07.690" end="00:47:10.440">We generally say subtle...modeling your data</p>
      <p begin="00:47:12.040" end="00:47:15.310">...right it's easy to kind of remodel united but sort</p>
      <p begin="00:47:15.310" end="00:47:21.340">...some kind of an idea think about how what are these entities that you're going to work with how you going to work</p>
      <p begin="00:47:21.340" end="00:47:25.490">with them how they're going to be query together how's your web application</p>
      <p begin="00:47:25.490" end="00:47:28.700">...mobile application get a query for them use them write them that kind</p>
      <p begin="00:47:28.700" end="00:47:31.880">of stuff so think about your access patterns...</p>
      <p begin="00:47:31.880" end="00:47:36.730">size kind of come up with your top five to ten queries ok now use the real</p>
      <p begin="00:47:36.730" end="00:47:41.820">...that you model this jason and use them in those queries and then what you will</p>
      <p begin="00:47:41.820" end="00:47:46.710">do is every time you execute any operation against document db you get</p>
      <p begin="00:47:46.710" end="00:47:48.860">backer question of charge that</p>
      <p begin="00:47:48.860" end="00:47:54.740">...charges the currency where we all the charge that we applied</p>
      <p begin="00:47:54.740" end="00:47:59.860">to that to that operation so you'll see like if I do a read I get back</p>
      <p begin="00:47:59.860" end="00:48:07.170">...you charge of one if I doa...of a large documentum I get back and...you count of one hundred?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:07.170" end="00:48:09.200">Model...dire your queries.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:10.260" end="00:48:15.690">Measure what...you charges...will help replying...capacity...help you understand with the you need</p>
      <p begin="00:48:15.690" end="00:48:20.340">and sone and stwo and sthree or if you need a thousand is threes or a hundred this</p>
      <p begin="00:48:20.340" end="00:48:24.470">one's or whatever the case maybe that's the only way you will...</p>
      <p begin="00:48:24.470" end="00:48:28.320">But, then measure those are use constantly that will have metrics...the portal</p>
      <p begin="00:48:28.320" end="00:48:33.290">...tell you what you'll average or you count was what was your maximum are you count what was your minimum are</p>
      <p begin="00:48:33.290" end="00:48:38.420">...that kind of some measure that keep track of that and as you see if that</p>
      <p begin="00:48:38.420" end="00:48:41.520">...too high you may want to go back and look at</p>
      <p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:49.690">remodeling your dine or changing your index all optimizing a queries on and those kinds of things.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:49.690" end="00:48:54.950">title modeling with the normalization so the biggest challenge that people coming from a relational</p>
      <p begin="00:48:54.950" end="00:48:57.840">...into a document...is how do I model</p>
      <p begin="00:48:57.840" end="00:49:03.640">medina okay because it's very different from how...model my data in</p>
      <p begin="00:49:03.640" end="00:49:09.600">a relational let's sayI have an application that's dealing with motor vehicles</p>
      <p begin="00:49:09.600" end="00:49:13.030">in a relational database what I would probably do is take at motor vehicle and</p>
      <p begin="00:49:13.030" end="00:49:16.530">...into its thousand individual pots and then I probably</p>
      <p begin="00:49:16.530" end="00:49:21.270">stalls individual parts all over the place and when I wanted to work with...data with</p>
      <p begin="00:49:21.270" end="00:49:25.590">a vehicle...write a query that would join all the tables together and</p>
      <p begin="00:49:25.590" end="00:49:28.970">re bold reassemble my vehicle and a</p>
      <p begin="00:49:28.970" end="00:49:33.410">document advice most of the time what we're doing is saying don't...vehicle down</p>
      <p begin="00:49:33.410" end="00:49:37.020">is stored as it is as an entity ok?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38.260" end="00:49:42.980">Now these are some things.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:42.980" end="00:49:47.970">...kind of good full so when you're doing one...few relationships ok so here</p>
      <p begin="00:49:47.970" end="00:49:51.390">I've got a person that has a few contact details.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:52.830" end="00:49:55.340">The imbedded data changes infrequently</p>
      <p begin="00:49:55.340" end="00:50:00.860">what I mean by that is if I was linking to I don't know let's say</p>
      <p begin="00:50:00.860" end="00:50:05.700">the address right in this case and the city was washington and it has</p>
      <p begin="00:50:05.700" end="00:50:10.530">...right now if that zip code changes often...</p>
      <p begin="00:50:10.530" end="00:50:15.500">if when you potentially don't want to do that because what you do is you have to</p>
      <p begin="00:50:15.500" end="00:50:19.870">go to every single document that has washington...code.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:19.870" end="00:50:24.670">Whereas in a relational database would be all easier because you've got a one recording chains that in one place</p>
      <p begin="00:50:24.670" end="00:50:30.280">and everybody would know about the change this time think about how many...that</p>
      <p begin="00:50:30.280" end="00:50:33.400">the value that you d normalizing is being...</p>
      <p begin="00:50:35.270" end="00:50:38.430">And, largely d normalizing provides for better read performance</p>
      <p begin="00:50:40.010" end="00:50:45.150">and applications you typically unless you're doing a little bit more complicated</p>
      <p begin="00:50:45.150" end="00:50:49.350">...you typically...compromise either read performance</p>
      <p begin="00:50:49.350" end="00:50:55.710">...performance so you-can either model your data for really, really good read performance...model your data for really,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:55.710" end="00:51:00.580">really good right performance or some kind of compromising between unless you're doing something like secure</p>
      <p begin="00:51:00.580" end="00:51:05.340">rs where you have two different models representing about but typically...normalize</p>
      <p begin="00:51:05.340" end="00:51:10.490">model is better for read why because when I'm reading...I...I did one entity and I</p>
      <p begin="00:51:10.490" end="00:51:17.540">bring it back I don't have to go to fifteen tables reassemble...and bring it back to.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:17.540" end="00:51:22.100">Sometimes the d normalizing is not provide way to go and you can stolen a document</p>
      <p begin="00:51:22.100" end="00:51:26.000">advice do referencing the referencing here is a weakling</p>
      <p begin="00:51:26.000" end="00:51:30.490">...because the server doesn't in full-size links so</p>
      <p begin="00:51:30.490" end="00:51:35.020">...I've said when I inserts and address document with user id xyz</p>
      <p begin="00:51:35.020" end="00:51:40.330">the database won't go insight hey there's no user called xyz therefore you can't do this</p>
      <p begin="00:51:40.330" end="00:51:41.780">...it won't do that</p>
      <p begin="00:51:41.780" end="00:51:45.540">four-year-olds gladly accepted so you could end up with broken links.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:45.540" end="00:51:49.670">You can use a triggering document db to kind of gone enforce that if you want...can create a</p>
      <p begin="00:51:49.670" end="00:51:54.180">...trigger that says when I put in...document my shoulders...</p>
      <p begin="00:51:54.180" end="00:52:01.050">that matches user id if it isn't reject the address document okay so you could do that in a trigger.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:01.050" end="00:52:05.070">Data modeling with referencing is usually better when the reference data</p>
      <p begin="00:52:05.070" end="00:52:09.960">changes frequently so when you want to go in and update that wrote that piece of reference data that's being reference by lots</p>
      <p begin="00:52:09.960" end="00:52:16.090">of other documents think about referencing your data.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:16.090" end="00:52:20.650">The data modeling with referencing when you have a heavy...workload</p>
      <p begin="00:52:20.650" end="00:52:24.220">is often kind of you'll get better performance out of your write workload.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:25.330" end="00:52:29.750">Right you can also aggregate these things so you can have hybrid models</p>
      <p begin="00:52:29.750" end="00:52:32.970">with some of your data is normalize some of you...normalized.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:34.910" end="00:52:39.600">So,...it's...of flick through the slides quite quickly use I want to get to the next part and I'm running out</p>
      <p begin="00:52:39.600" end="00:52:45.190">of time but, some...somewhat jason data modeling...the slides will be available off</p>
      <p begin="00:52:45.190" end="00:52:50.400">...as you can go and have a look at those but some of those things over there make...may seem small but</p>
      <p begin="00:52:50.400" end="00:52:55.920">...very big difference when you model your application?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:55.920" end="00:53:00.470">Indexing policies again I told you can play around with indexing policies and ranges</p>
      <p begin="00:53:00.470" end="00:53:05.390">in precision and all that kind of...queries look which are you charges</p>

      <p begin="00:53:15.160" end="00:53:20.010">...limit the use of scan operations okay so if you don't have a range</p>
      <p begin="00:53:20.010" end="00:53:24.640">...on-the-field don't do a range operation...don't</p>
      <p begin="00:53:24.640" end="00:53:29.470">...queries that say not so often people say</p>

      <p begin="00:53:43.510" end="00:53:48.030">...that's a much more efficient query that will give you the exact same results it</p>
      <p begin="00:53:48.030" end="00:53:53.530">...sighing where a lot of mile so simple things like that if you have</p>
      <p begin="00:53:53.530" end="00:53:57.170">...way clauses include other particles.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:57.170" end="00:54:02.130">All...inductive...db you need to partition for two reasons data</p>
      <p begin="00:54:02.130" end="00:54:05.780">size because every collection is I need to engage in size today</p>

      <p begin="00:54:21.490" end="00:54:25.640">How do you scale out so there's a couple of different ways the first is pullover</p>
      <p begin="00:54:25.640" end="00:54:29.310">...start-one petition you...get to some kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:54:29.310" end="00:54:32.220">...room and then you start spilling over to the next one day?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:33.700" end="00:54:35.550">...notion of a range.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:35.550" end="00:54:38.650">So,...for the current period of time</p>
      <p begin="00:54:38.650" end="00:54:43.090">okay today seven days this month this year and then when</p>
      <p begin="00:54:43.090" end="00:54:46.660">that period falls over you move to the next one when appeared</p>
      <p begin="00:54:46.660" end="00:54:52.010">...you move to the next one and eventually you'll in a jobs in pog per jot all</p>
      <p begin="00:54:53.580" end="00:54:58.100">And, then you also have this notion of a lookup so some kind of look up so I'm</p>

      <p begin="00:59:43.840" end="00:59:48.680">will public preview in light last year we gi dvs.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:48.680" end="00:59:50.690">Couple weeks ago and,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:50.690" end="00:59:55.640">since then we've done deployments every single week...every single week</p>
      <p begin="00:59:55.640" end="01:00:00.750">...push the deployment we've pushed hundreds of deployments sometimes even more than once a week</p>
      <p begin="01:00:00.750" end="01:00:06.220">and what we've been actually focusing on is making sure that first and foremost the services stable</p>
      <p begin="01:00:06.220" end="01:00:11.080">and...it scales okay so,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:11.080" end="01:00:15.480">yes, there are a couple of features that we're short all right but we needed to make sure that the</p>
      <p begin="01:00:15.480" end="01:00:18.900">bison solid that we can bowl these features on top of so we're</p>
      <p begin="01:00:18.900" end="01:00:23.150">...kind of catching up a little bit and, there's still some foundation</p>
      <p begin="01:00:23.150" end="01:00:27.750">work we're doing and we have a whole bunch of features kind of queued up and the sues</p>
      <p begin="01:00:27.750" end="01:00:32.610">where we feel comfortable those features should role really quickly?</p>
      <p begin="01:00:32.610" end="01:00:36.240">So, showtime future in the next.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:36.610">I want</p>
      <p begin="01:00:36.610" end="01:00:42.380">...too much in the next weeks we should be able to see name based routing</p>
      <p begin="01:00:42.380" end="01:00:47.620">okay so people have told us that...like self links self links when you</p>
      <p begin="01:00:47.620" end="01:00:52.560">...the...internal your eyes so every resources a has a as a</p>
      <p begin="01:00:52.560" end="01:00:56.990">...it when you create a document we create this internal thing called</p>

      <p begin="01:01:01.750" end="01:01:04.180">You don't know what it is so, you know,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:04.180" end="01:01:09.040">you document bites id you don't necessarily know what...resource ideas in order to go</p>
      <p begin="01:01:09.040" end="01:01:13.380">...read the document what you gotta go do is you gotta go query for it bring it back get sell</p>
      <p begin="01:01:13.380" end="01:01:16.590">...can then use...are applying so what</p>
      <p begin="01:01:16.590" end="01:01:20.450">word bringing out fairly shortly is concept of nine based routing</p>
      <p begin="01:01:20.450" end="01:01:24.720">name base being the id that you've given us...you create a document</p>
      <p begin="01:01:24.720" end="01:01:30.770">called my document id you'll be able to get include that inside url</p>
      <p begin="01:01:30.770" end="01:01:35.090">I have you'll supplied ideas and its instead of just our internal resource</p>
      <p begin="01:01:35.090" end="01:01:42.110">...which will make we hope a huge difference so, we also be doing range</p>
      <p begin="01:01:42.110" end="01:01:45.470">indexes for strings so you can do things like starts with ends with contains.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:46.660" end="01:01:51.200">And, then probably the big one that everybody's writing for is</p>
      <p begin="01:01:52.590" end="01:01:55.830">...auto by is queued it's in our internal</p>
      <p begin="01:01:55.830" end="01:01:58.710">taste environment is going through some serious kind of strange</p>
      <p begin="01:01:58.710" end="01:02:04.050">and tasting and as soon as we feel comfortable vthree features...land and,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:04.050" end="01:02:10.470">all and hopefully very soon I'm hoping to have...that's the and, we're</p>
      <p begin="01:02:10.470" end="01:02:17.110">only just getting going we have features planned for ages okay we're only getting going</p>
      <p begin="01:02:17.110" end="01:02:19.030">...because this is a service it means that</p>
      <p begin="01:02:19.030" end="01:02:25.820">we can deliver features on a weekly vices if we need to on a daily basis if we have</p>
      <p begin="01:02:25.820" end="01:02:30.560">Please keep telling us what the features are please on thing we're ignoring you</p>
      <p begin="01:02:30.560" end="01:02:34.580">...not ignoring you were listening to every single feedback request that comes</p>
      <p begin="01:02:34.580" end="01:02:38.070">in and we feed them into our planning and we feed them into</p>

      <p begin="01:02:47.060" end="01:02:53.400">us that and,...was...point because we are looking to grow</p>
      <p begin="01:02:53.400" end="01:02:56.680">...team so there's the feedback in the forms so the</p>
      <p begin="01:02:56.680" end="01:03:00.980">user voice one and the forms if you've got a problem so user voice if you want to feature...</p>
      <p begin="01:03:00.980" end="01:03:07.130">for forms if you have a problem go posted I personally spend way too much time</p>
      <p begin="01:03:08.790" end="01:03:10.840">authoring forms.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:10.840" end="01:03:15.100">And, not responding to other things that I should be doing but that's because I</p>
      <p begin="01:03:15.100" end="01:03:19.980">feel passionately about helping people kind of you...problems that you've</p>
      <p begin="01:03:19.980" end="01:03:24.250">gotten using those problems to learn how we can make the service better in the future</p>
      <p begin="01:03:24.250" end="01:03:29.420">that's a great learning experience for us then the product page in the dachshund tutorials</p>
      <p begin="01:03:29.420" end="01:03:33.260">...looking for more info and more dachshund tutorials weekly publishing you</p>
      <p begin="01:03:33.260" end="01:03:37.630">...need tutorials all the time so please going to have a look...and,</p>
      <p begin="01:03:37.630" end="01:03:41.520">use the feedback if you if you like the document tells you like the document</p>
      <p begin="01:03:41.520" end="01:03:46.460">because that gives us an idea of what kind of documents you like if you don't like the documents tells you are</p>
      <p begin="01:03:46.460" end="01:03:51.880">like intel's why you like it because then we can go and improvement document write.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:51.880" end="01:03:55.110">In samples there's lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of samples we push</p>
